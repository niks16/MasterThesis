rtpc19,AsymmetricalReward,9,https://redd.it/rtpc19,None,"Building a new home, need help on choosing outlets for S19. 14-50, LR-30,?"," Hi, I‚Äôm in the process of building a new home (Canada) and I hoping for your help in determining the best outlets to ask the builder to add. Electrical load won‚Äôt be an issue, because my area is newer with higher amp service. 

Based on Antminer S19‚Äôs 20amp requirement, I should be able to expand up to 4 units on my property. However I am a beginner and plan to only start with 1 unit. I want mine in the basement in the winter for the free heat and then move it to the garage in the summer. 

For the garage outlet, I will have a NEMA 14-50R, that one day I will use for an electric car. For the finished basement, I was thinking of putting another 14-50R, that can also used for an electric stove. I don‚Äôt think I will actually need a stove in the future, but thought it would be useful if I resell the house. 

Questions:

1. It seems with the 14-50 receptacle, they generally don‚Äôt make any PDUs for it. The only way I found that I could power the Antminer‚Äôs C13/14 plugs is buying from an ebay seller‚Äôs specific mining power hub([https://www.ebay.com/itm/294256300465?hash=item44830ad1b1:g:LcoAAOSwyo1hR\~MD](https://www.ebay.com/itm/294256300465?hash=item44830ad1b1:g:LcoAAOSwyo1hR~MD)). Not sure how safe it, scared to burn my home down. Are there other solutions that I am overlooking?

2. When it comes to PDUs, I think most are built for L6-30R? (Not sure). Maybe for my basement I should actually install the L6-30R? The downside I don‚Äôt think I can reuse the L6-30 for other purposes? I was also thinking another route is going with the 14-50 and running an ACWorks adaptor to L6-30, but I wonder if that introduces another fire risk? 

3. What should I be doing for surge protection, what device would I need and where does it sit between, the outlet, PDU, and miner?

4. Should I ask to ask to add a CAT6 in my garage so I directly plug ethernet into the S19 or just go with wifi extenders from my living room, which I think could also be useful for my future wifi cameras. 

Thank you",1,bitcoinmining,2022-01-01 18:35:23

rty040,porkchopsandwiches17,13,https://redd.it/rty040,None,Desperately need help with S9 running at 30 TH/s??,"Hi all, I'm going to try to explain this the best I can.. I currently have 2 s9's running at a commercial space. One of the machines is having problems, whenever I turn it on it does fine for a few minutes, but after that I will go up to about 25-35 TH/s, stay there for a few minutes, then the machine will start blinking red and basically reset and go back through the cycle.. What's weird is the other s9 is running in the exact same space, with the same set up and it has been running for days with no issues. What's even weirder, is when I take the problem s9 home to trouble shoot, it has no problems and stays around 14.5 TH/s. I have no clue what's changes when I take it back to the commercial space and it goes to 30 TH/s. I've added some screen shots of the status when it was running in the commercial space. I bought this on eBay, and im wondering if I should just return it. I also notice the fan speed on this machine is quite a bit lower than the other s9.

I've tried rebooting, hard reset, trying different outlets, moving location of miner,  nothing is working. And again, when I take it home and plug it in, it works perfectly fine.. I tried to upgrade the firmware, Im just getting the signature error every time. Tried every browser, several different computers too. 

Thanks!

rvkpks,Active-Indication-68,9,https://redd.it/rvkpks,None,How can I safely source mining machines directly from China?,"My company has been selling and repairing mining machines in China for a long time and I will explain how we trade mining machines in China.

This article will not recommend any websites.

&#x200B;

What is the process of trading ASIC miner in China?

Mining machine trading in China will only be done on WeChat (similar to WhatsApp), because the price of ASIC miner fluctuates daily, so when a customer needs to purchase a ASIC miner we will send them today's price list, mining machine trading companies will have contact information for each other, and if our company doesn't have the machine our customer needs, we will post a purchase request to another company.

&#x200B;

So how do we purchase ASIC miner from manufacturers?

Take this purchase of L7 from Bitmain for example, usually several companies will come together in a joint venture to purchase from Bitmain (there will be hundreds of millions of RMB in capital) and then the machines will be distributed based on the capital contribution.

Because Bitmain will give a lot of priority policies to customers with large orders (like getting the machines earlier).

&#x200B;

How do individuals purchase from distributors?

Again, purchases will be made via WeChat, where you can send a direct message to the sales people of all the dealers of ASIC miner, and they will send you their quotes so you can compare multiple ones before buying.

If you are sure about the purchase you can pay a part of the deposit upfront and when the machine is ready to be shipped you need to pay the remaining amount. Usually a video of the machine will be sent to you before delivery and test pictures of the machine will be sent.

&#x200B;

How can foreign customers order from Chinese distributors?

1. The best way is to add the contact information of the Chinese salesperson directly and you can verify his company through pictures or videos (e.g. ask him to send a live video or pictures of the mining machine).

2. I don't recommend using Alibaba, because mining machine sales have been banned by Alibaba, which means your transactions are not protected by the platform.

3. Find a Chinese buyer, this way you will pay some extra fees to your buyer but he will help you to verify if the company is trustworthy or even go directly to the company to investigate.

I see people keep talking about hiring electricians and doing some crazy power, cabling, and wire setup. Is that necessary? Can‚Äôt I just plug the miner into a floor socket in my office? Profitability is not a concern as the power bill is fixed regardless of consumption. Essentially, I‚Äôll have zero power cost.
3. I‚Äôm planning to set it up in my empty office as we have gone remote but still have to maintain an office as employees use it a few times a month. We have a 50 MBPS internet connection. Will that suffice? Will it affect the internet speed for others when they are browsing the internet?
4. Does it require any specific cable or equipment to install or everything inside the box should suffice to have it up and running?
5. I take it they are loud and produce a lot of heat. It‚Äôs a small office with no windows. It has central cooling so the office is usually very cold. Will that suffice to keep the miner and office temperature within the normal range?
6. Anything else I need to know?",3,bitcoinmining,2022-01-04 12:22:38

rw3je7,Smirkydarkdude,50,https://redd.it/rw3je7,None,Unpopular Opinion,"Ok... so first off, I'm going to start with an apology.  I realize some of you will fee personally attacked and that's not the intention.  I just need to get this off my chest and I fully expect to be downvoted to oblivion.  But I feel I need to share this.  I have just had my first up close and personal experience with bitcoin mining.  

I hated everything about it.  

A family member has a pile of S19's in his garage.  They run 24/7 and produce an extreme amount of heat and noise (and yes, some profit of course).  He has some noise abatement in place and also runs an AC unit aimed at the miners to kill the heat.  He has plans on moving the operation to a shed.  But for now, because of the location of his garage, these units pump a fair bit of heat into his house.  So he has to run a lot of AC to cool the house.  It's not ideal to say the least.  Plus the low level noise is present everywhere in the house.  It would drive me insane.  Just from a physical comfort point of view mining is unpleasant.  

And if that's where it ended, it would be his choice alone.  But it's not.

He is pulling most of a 200 Amp service to either mine Bitcoin or cool his garage or cool his house.  That power doesn't just float in on the wings of the power fairy.  It has to come from somewhere.  In his location every watt of power means coal is being burned.  And that coal means CO2 released into the environment.

Naturally you can argue that other sources of CO2 are worse.  Cars, planes, Elon flying his rockets, hell even the Fed printing paper money releases CO2.  Sure... all true.  But none of that negates the fact that if he switched off his miners there would be (slightly) less CO2 released.  He's a smart guy, has a great job - he could put up some solar and drive an EV.  But no.  

He's a young guy and theoretically concerned about the environment... but how can you reconcile that position with a garage full of miners?  He essentially burns coal for spending money that he doesn't really need.

I had been thinking of getting into hosted mining (thus my membership here).  But that first hand experience?  Nope.  I'm out.  Bitcoin is not for me. 

Anyway I've said my bit.  Go ahead.  I fully expect your scorn and downvotes.",0,bitcoinmining,2022-01-04 20:13:27

I am a begginer that jumped in crypto space in 2020. I recently decided to do a research and even start mining with a decent budget 10-20k. I must also note i pay 0.06$ per kw So in the research I did, I found one miner called aladdin t1 32t and it is supposed to do a 8.67 daily gross - 4.03$ energy cost= 4.64$ so with my power it gives give or take 5$ per day. The thing is that these miners are selling each for 100-250$ and I was planning to get around 81 of them which will give me profit around 405$ per day. I am clearly missing something obvious here because how can this combination outperform the best asic miners like goldshell kd5 and bitmain antminer e9. Does anyone know if there called aladdin miners are legit or a scam? Because it sounds too good to be true.

ry0wm3,River_Jester,9,https://redd.it/ry0wm3,None,"Would it be possible to outfit a vehicle with solar, internet, mining equipment that would make enough crypto to pay for fuel or power for avg 10,000mi/yr avg?","Obviously with crypto volatility the answer is ""?"" But I'm trying to conceptualize something. Ik it takes a lot of space for Solar. So is it better to try and find semi truck that has good fuel economy? Any ideas would be appreciated.

I have no concrete plans to build this however if I had ""F@#$ you"" money, I most definitly would try.

Edit 1: doesn't seem like this is gonna work. Maybe a boat could. A large boat.",0,bitcoinmining,2022-01-07 06:33:00

rygxib,edoardocanal,52,https://redd.it/rygxib,None,Your opinion on mining Bitcoin.,"I am looking for guidance. I am 21, turning 22 from Italy. I have access to a lot of capital. ‚Ç¨200k+.
My main goal would be to get an ROI of the initial investment in under 365 days, which means 100% (I know it‚Äôs high).
Right now I have access to a lot of electricity from solar panels that I‚Äôd be paying 0.12-0.15‚Ç¨ Kw/h. 
With the amount of money I have available could setup in other European countries where electricity is cheaper. 
My idea is to start mining BTC: buy ASIC miners. 
My main concern would be that mining capacity decreases a lot tho since the competition is so strong and block decripting becomes harder. Electricity consumption of asic miners is very high so ROI time increases, but luckily I have access to relatively cheap electricity. 
Another important variable is price of BTC, heavily influencing the ROI. 
Should I opt for BTC with this amount of capital or GPUs? 
How long before I need to replace the asic miners? 

Any help is appreciated guys. 

Please help me out. 

I‚Äôve done my research and I know how to build the rigs.

I just don‚Äôt know what to mine.

I'm parting with three of my L3+/++ units to free up a circuit for an S19 Pro. Being a home basement miner has advantages and disadvantages, a big one is space. Anyway I have three units available now and maybe 3-6 more in the next few weeks if the L7 ever ships.

The three I have now have all been running in a clean basement for a year and I have maintained them well (if you know me you know I'm all about taking care of them.) 

Two of them I'm asking $1100 each (they cleanly hash at just over 600MH/s) and one I'm asking $1000 (one hash board I under clock as it has problems so I only get around 520MH/s total on this one.) If I get around to it I will look into repairing that hash board, but figured I'd discount it $100 if someone wants it as is. I run HiveOS on all them as well so that will be preloaded.

Price is shipped, will take payment any number of ways. DM if interested and I can share photos of their hashing and of the units.",2,bitcoinmining,2022-01-08 20:59:20

Going off the whattomine website, these would bring in ~$11-12/day making a stupid long ROI. Seller is claiming to get $4/day on the L3s and $5-6/day with the avalon. Does this sound legit?

Porch Pirates brazenly grab packages even knowing they are on Ring or Blink cameras broadcast out to everyone on Nextdoor.  Most of us would rather have the rare equipment, than a refund. Hence, almost all mining equipment deliveries are sent with signature requirements.  This all makes sense.

But, not a single signature required delivery at my house has been signed for by me or anyone at my house.  UPS, USPS and FedEx have not even knocked on my door!  I put a sign up that essentially reads: if this sign is up, please knock for signature deliveries.  I'm usually in a room next to the door when I get a text saying my item was delivered and signed for by me.  I run to the door and sometimes see the truck already down the block.  I am getting my deliveries, but I'm altering my schedule to remain available.   I'd be less annoyed if they could at least be semi-accurate with delivery time windows.  ""Tomorrow by 9PM"" is BS.  ""On the Truck, out for delivery"" is meaningless.  FedEx gave me three different committed delivery times for one package and missed all three.  When it did arrive late last night, you guessed it!  They claimed I signed for it!  It's 2022 people!  lol

Is anyone else annoyed with this?  Having the same experience?  Is it time to push back on the signature requirement, or require they actually get it?  Should we be reporting this a fraud?  Thoughts?

Would anybody be interested in having a discussion with me about the current state of natural gas flare mining in Texas? Perhaps one of you has done some leg work and needs a business partner or perhaps would like to explore an opportunity together. I have resources, but am in need of someone who may have connections to an oil well owner, or at least have some involvement in the industry.  

For those who may not be aware, large amounts of excess natural gas is typically wasted and burned off from oil drilling wells. These natural gas sources are typically too far from the grid and it would not make financial sense to install the necessary infrastructure to put it to use. Mobile BTC mining units can be deployed at these flare sites and make use of the otherwise wasted gas. This is not a new concept, and has been done before. I am looking to see if some others are just as interested in this as I am, and I know quite a bit of you are here in Texas as well. 

Let me know.",5,bitcoinmining,2022-01-11 00:57:15

I‚Äôm not a mining noob. I‚Äôve been mining eth on my gpu rigs for a while now and they‚Äôve all ROI‚Äôd 2x+ at this point. I say this only to point out that I understand the pitfalls of predicting revenues, increasing network difficulty, etc.

To be clear, I will not be doing this for passive income, but rather for hodling for long-term investment value. Nevertheless, I‚Äôm looking to transition to BTC mining prior to PoS going live and would like to get your take on this‚Ä¶

My current (but not permanent) challenge is that I live in an apartment and ASIC miners are both too loud and too power hungry to be feasible.

Thus, I‚Äôm considering beginning the journey via a hosting company like Compass or the like. I know that forces me to pay their prices for hardware, which seem to be sometimes substantially higher than the open market, but until they allow me to send them my own hardware, it seems a cost I will have to accept.

I would likely start by buying 1-2 hosted miners and then add 1 ever so often as my other investments generate additional capital.

Hello all,

I've recently purchased  brand new S19J Pro (104t).

I've had all 10 rigs running for the past month and have noticed that one of my machines has NEVER ran over 98th ish Initially I thought it was normal, and that it needed time to get to its maximum hashrate, but being that its the same as my other rigs and they are all running at full power I decided to look into the web interface and noticed that the Frequency is set to 505, and the theoretical hashrate is 32705GHs as opposed to my other miners, that the frequency is 545 and theoretical hashrate is 35296GHs.

I installed the latest firmware via the web interface and download from the bitmain website, but my issue remains. I've tested the power draw from the PSU to determine if maybe I was not pulling enough power and it's pulling just as much as my other rigs so I don't think the PSU is at fault here.

Why would a company with readily available miners AND readily available hosting space sell this opportunity to you instead of taking it for themselves? 

The answer is pretty simple, they are charging you MORE than they would expect to make if they used their own space to mine with their own miners. What does this mean for you? It means that you are overpaying and likely to never see any profit with these deals. 

Several of these companies boast an affordable hosting rate of <$0.08/kWh or so, which would be a great rate indeed, however, you must purchase extremely highly marked up miners to get that rate making it a terrible deal.

I'd like to experiment with Bitcoin mining mostly for **educational** reasons. For the past year, I've been studying a lot of the cryptography and computer science behind bitcoin, and I'd like to expand my knowledge to the energy side as well. My learning style is hands-on, which is why I'm thinking of setting up some mining infrastructure myself.

I'm not that interested in creating another stream of income or making lots of money - *though, ideally, I'd like to recoup at least* ***50%-75%*** *of my financial investment within 12-24 months of mining*. Does anyone have any suggestions of how to do this **without spending over $2k in infrastructure**? For context, energy near me is about 12.4 ¬¢/kWh.

From my brief research so far, it looks like the NVIDIA RTX 3080 is within my range, though I've also read some comments indicating that GPU mining for Bitcoin is essentially useless these days. Is that true? Would I really just be throwing my money away if I buy anything other than an ASIC miner?

s6r0r3,SimplestGamer,10,https://redd.it/s6r0r3,None,Should I buy S19J pro NOW or AFTER Chinese New Year,"Buying Now

Pro

\- Taking action now

\- 2-3 Weeks extra mined coins

\- Don't have to have deal with delayed shipping due to chinese new year

\- Receive in 7-10 days from now.

\- Motivate me to set everything up for it ASAP. (power, ethernet, storage box)

\- Will be amazing if we go bullish. So I would have paid a discount for miner prices to just rise. 

&#x200B;

Con

\- Bitcoin usually dips during Chinese new year so I might be buying miners at a premium? (i can't confirm, new to mining)

\- Have not set up power + ethernet set up + outdoor storage box (might take a few weeks) (will be forced to rush and maybe pay a premium for things I need done to beat the 6-10 day shipping time if I beat Chinese new year and order now and have it running the moment I get it)

\- If things not ready when arrived, S19J Pro would either be sitting or running insanely loudly in my living room. 

\- Bitcoin might continue to dip if we going bearish. So I would have paid a premium for miner prices to just dip.",4,bitcoinmining,2022-01-18 06:41:37

Hey everyone,

New here and passionate about contributing to the Bitcoin network. I‚Äôve been in since 2016 and got my first Bitcoin from my mentor when it was at $700. I‚Äôve been accumulating since. 

Life has changed now for me, in many ways and I‚Äôve always been interested in mining but, wasn‚Äôt focused enough at the time. 

I have some questions around underwater Bitcoin mining. More like ocean farm mining. 

Maybe in containers ? Or, similar to the way Microsoft has successfully ran a data center under water. 


Just some thoughts. What should I know when planning? Feasibility, best type of miner to use? Super environmentally friendly. 

I‚Äôm moving to the Caribbean in a few weeks so, ideally that‚Äôs where I would seek to set up and launch. 

I view it as a modular build out, given the underwater environmental concerns and the vast size of the ocean. 


P.S I am not ruling out a modified offshore oil rig, powered by renewable energy.

I know it has to be possible to setup a solo BTC mining operation at the house without using a third party solo or pool operator.  It just has to be possible. I have an old S5 and I want to point my son on the right path so he can set it up and get a smile on his face along with a high five.  Money is not an issue nor is the fact that it will never mine a block in a lifetime.  This is a project to just show it can be done. We both don't care if it ever lines a block.  But we both want to see it try. 

If I need to sign an nda to protect trade secrets or swear a blood oath on the how-to, i am hapoy to do it.  I have seen so many people shoot down the idea of solo BTC mining that it makes my son even more excited to do it. 

So, is there a secret handshake or something that I need to do to learn how to help my son setup a solo BTC mining op at the house?   If the huge data centers with 100,000 rigs can do it, then it can be done.

I found a couple of investors who seem interested. And i want to make sure its not a bad idea.

These are the numbers: (roughly)

100x Antminer L7 at $20K = $2M

2.5MW Solar power plant = $1.5M

this would potentially generate around 200K/month 

My problem is calculating depreciation of the profitability of the miners over time with factors such as ltc price, network difficulty and hashrate. 

The ROI would be in 18 months.

sa9btz,NickPronto,25,https://redd.it/sa9btz,None,BTC Mining Profitability Calculations - 2022 - Immersion Farm,"Hi Everyone.

[**Miner Math**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1I0tWYSBMwVeG52znYXh8n9IFvOzEccr781E-gYacNfU/edit#gid=0)

Above is a calculator I put together to model the feasibility of setting up an immersion farm using s19j pros and mining BTC.

**TL;DR: My calculations show that at \~$14000 per Bitmain s19j Pro with an OC at 140th/s, mining is not profitable given the difficulty increases outpacing the CAGR of BTCs value in perpetuity.**

This calculator takes in a doubling of difficulty increase by the end of 2022, and an additional 50% increase in 2023. It doesn't account for halving. It also has a built in growth model (if profitable) to reinvest your profits back into more miners, accelerating your maximum KW demand of your facility/building.

It also accounts for compounded growth rate of BTC over the adjustable time frame, but even a hyper bullish $500k/BTC in 5 years does not prove to be profitable.

Does anyone have a moment to review the calculations? I don't understand how farms are coming online even with cheap/free electricity since the CAPEX of buying the machines paired with the difficulty increase will never be profitable. The second tab on the bottom explains the calculations and descriptions.

The only way I see this being profitable if you're able to get sub $0.04/kWh and s19j Pros below $8000.

Any analysts out there want to check my math? **I feel I have to have made a mistake somewhere.**

Feel free to copy the calculator and mess around with it. It pulls live data if you refresh.",8,bitcoinmining,2022-01-22 18:55:47

To my knowledge, these devices can be used to perform basic logical operations, and I don‚Äôt know of any reason why they couldn‚Äôt be designed to perform the SHA256 hash function.

Due to the fact that these devices are intended to be deployed in locations where they are needed, ASPICs are currently being developed to use locally-powered lasers as a source of coherence. However, it is well-known that Bitcoin mining is *location agnostic*. As it turns out, lasers can be produced from solar radiation: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar-pumped\_laser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar-pumped_laser).

Of course, Bitcoin‚Äôs Proof of Work algorithm includes randomly guessing a nonce. As it turns out, random number generation can be performed using either a coherent or incoherent source. [https://arxiv.org/pdf/1611.00224.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1611.00224.pdf), [https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.08743](https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.08743).

Therefore, is it, or is it not, conceivable that the *work* that is required to prove the sequential ordering of Bitcoin transactions can be performed by the sun? And, is it, or is it not, also conceivable that the *proof* of that order can be computed by the radiance of the sun?

Therefore, isn't it conceivable that the sole source of all new bitcoins could, someday, be the sun? Doesn't this also solve the oft-cited problem of Bitcoin's security post-2140?

Edit: See this video, for example, of a professor from the Netherlands giving a talk about optical computing. https://youtu.be/UqeH7ozVOpQ. The video is more than an hour long, but the summary is that optical computers have been following Moore‚Äôs Law during the past couple of decades the same way electronics followed Moore‚Äôs Law in the latter half of the 1900s. They are now making optical computing chips as neural nets in AI, and these chips are much more efficient than their traditional electronic counterparts.

Edit 2: One of the companies that is mentioned in this professor‚Äôs talk is LightElligence. https://www.lightelligence.ai/technology . ‚ÄúBy processing information with light, our chips offer ultra high speed, low latency, and low power consumption representing *orders of magnitude* improvement over traditional electronic architectures.‚Äù This particular company specializes in optical chips designed for AI applications. If Bitcoin continues to grow, I expect there will become a greater incentive for companies to develop similar ASPICs designed for SHA256 hash.",11,bitcoinmining,2022-01-22 20:21:05

This article talks about difficulty at all time highs. And that sounds like BTC can snap the down turn and go up at any moment like a powder keg.

The problem I see is, what if this is a race to the bottom?

Massive BTC self miners are dropping costs to really deep lows. I see MARA is at $5,700 or so per BTC mined. RIOT is at $6,000.

What's a miner's take on the idea that BTC price won't recover versus the difficulty level? Because the production cost of BTC has declined. Therefore the ATH difficulty looks like a new low in BTC.

My profit at 21 cents per th was enough to make me happy, but this morning when I woke up and saw 17 cents I had to shut down for a bit. At 17 cents per th I am just under the line for profit (if I keep them running I'm losing 3 bucks a day).

Now I want to know what you guys are doing for solutions? I have already been looking for ways to increase efficiency, I've been trying to finesse my clocking and voltage to get the highest possible speed while keeping the lowest possible power draw. 

My next solution is to plumb in a natural gas line with a quick connect on the side of my house and run a natural gas generator. I already have the generator, and natural gas is extremely cheap where I live at around 8 dollars Canadian pet gj (2.5 cents per kwh with 100% generator efficiency, approximately 3.5 cents after loss with my generator)

sac9bc,AndrewAwakened,12,https://redd.it/sac9bc,None,Need some help understanding powering multiple ASIC miners in a commercial building,"So I've decided that while I'm waiting for a hosting facility to come online, I might as well run them temporarily at the office in the meantime instead of letting them sit idle. I'll be able to get 600 amps, 3 phase service in the building. However I need some help understanding how the power needs to be set up for the miners. 

Lets say I'm using S17's which use 2520 watts  of power. I see using this online calculator ([https://www.deelat.com/amperage-calculator](https://www.deelat.com/amperage-calculator)) that they should each draw about 7 amps current. Now the maximum amperage circuit I'm familiar with from my home is 50 amps - does the same still apply in a commercial setup, or are electricians able to wire higher current circuits? Because if the limit is 50, then to stay safe I can only use 40, so dividing by 7 amps per miner means I'd be limited to six s17's on each 50 amp circuit. And then with 600 amps total current coming in to the breaker, that's 12 such circuits which should support a maximum of 72 Antminer S17s. 

Am I working that out correctly, or is there something I'm missing - is there any way I could safely support more miners?",3,bitcoinmining,2022-01-22 21:11:47

What's happening to small bitcoin miners seems to be similar to what happened to small time gold miners as the biggest gold miners began to move millions of yards of rock a day instead of thousands of yards a week.

I think there was a race to raise capital by large mining startups and that they grabbed up all the supply at profitable prices, drove up these prices and now small time miners will struggle to replace their inventory.

Scalability allows these big mines to lower costs in ways small timers cannot. And the cost of the ASICS will constantly be like low hanging fruit but just out of reach of profitable. 

Since cost is everything, I'd say the best chance of a small time miner surviving will be if you can generate your own power from scrap generators you build yourself that cost you nothing.

This can be done if you tear apart electric motors...but how can you survive as a small time miner buying everything off the shelf?

You can't control the price of ASIC. That's an arms race.

You can't scale facilities, most do it out of expensive commercial malls or their houses.

So the only cost you can control is power.

Which in theory if you're mining out of your house you can rig something up.

But beyond that...what can you do?",9,bitcoinmining,2022-01-23 18:23:38

I work for a Bitcoin mining facility here in the Houston area; We repair and sell miners. We have recently made a change in our repair process to use monolithic heatsinks as opposed to our previous method of re-attaching the original 44/65 heatsinks. I just wanted to gather the general consensus on pricing for these ""repaired"" S17+ and T17+.

Originally we offered our repaired machines (We ONLY sell 17 models that have had their heatsinks repaired) for $50/TH.  So a factory S17+ (70T) would be $3,500 and T17+ (55T) would be $2,750. I have noticed that pricing for FACTORY S/T17+ is around $3,000+ for T17+ and $4,000+ for S17+. In my opinion that seems high, but I am biased as we offer a lot more for a lot less.

Which leads me to my question, is $3,100 and $4,000 a fair price for a T/S17+ that will NOT suffer from any dysfunction and/or movement of the heat sinks? We don't guarantee ""x"" amount of time, but we DO guarantee you will not have any dysfunction from heatsinks, which is the #1 reason we all stay away from the models. The heatsinks are screwed onto the board, so they are very secure and keep temperatures good enough to squeeze an OC in there.

It is not running yet, but should be in a few months. I am Federally Incorporated in Canada so everything is public record so no sketchy BS. I see most places charge 8-9c USD/kwh so that would probably be my going rate also.
 
Currently I could already run about 200kW without needing to pull in a new line, but if there is enough demand I can pay the extra for the new line. It's not very big scale so maybe about 1MW total possibly slightly more if the demand is there. If I'm missing something please let me know.

seib8z,bitcornminerguy,6,https://redd.it/seib8z,None,Is This Old Miner Crazy or Brilliant?,"A few months ago a friend of mine from across town that also mines told me that I need to meet an ""old timer"" that he met at some mining meetup years ago. They still get coffee now and again, so this last week I had the pleasure of meeting old Pete.

He runs a fairly clean operation at his home: Eight Antminer S19s and a dozen Antminer L3+ units. He's been mining since late 2015 and said one of his secrets to success is to swap up to newer gear as fast as he can. They're neatly seated on shelving units with a hot box system to take away the warm air.

But what fascinated me endlessly was his tale of his ""million dollar army."" Over the years he's had some units fail. He's also bought lots of ""bad"" miners from some folks, and worked through repairing as many of them as he could. He's got an electrical engineering background, and seems to know how to run through a pile of dead machines and cull together a few working ones from all the parts.

Anyhow... he has this second shelf in his mining shed full of old clunkers... all in working order (but turned off). He has S7s and S9s and S11s and some other stuff I couldn't really make out from his photos. Some of them he said are missing cards. It was wild. Probably about 20 old miners in total. When I asked him what this was for... he said it was his ""million dollar army"" -- he said at the point where BTC hits at or near $1M in price, he figures folks will be clamoring for all the BTC they can get their hands on, and at that point running these old things, as horrible and inefficient as they may be, won't matter... it'll be far too profitable NOT to have as many miners as you can running. ""Just get satoshis,"" he said.

At first blush, I thought he was a genius. He took old broke-down machines and made them work. His costs per machine are next to nothing. He's not running them now, so he's losing nothing... and he seems content with his ""modern"" setup cranking away... so is it smart to hang on to some older machines and only fire them up when the $1M fairy arrives? Should we all have a ""million dollar army"" or is this just and old man and his lunacy? I can't decide.",0,bitcoinmining,2022-01-28 04:40:02

The new unit achieves a whopping 198 TH/s hashrate, 41% more than the current flagship S19 XP model that achieves 140 TH/s.

The new hydro cooled unit is not only more powerful, but is more efficient as well. It has an efficiency rating of 27.5 J/TH and a power consumption of 5445W. In comparison, the S19 XP is rated at 21.5 J/TH with a power consumption of 3010W. These numbers also make the S19 Pro+ Hydro almost twice as powerful as the base S19 Pro model.

This announcement comes perfectly timed as the BTC mining difficulty has reached an¬†all-time high¬†this month. Miners need as much computing power as they can get in order to maximize their mining profits, as earning Bitcoin will only get more difficult. More powerful hardware in turn runs at higher temperatures, hence why this time around Bitmain went with a liquid cooling solution to help keep S19 Pro+ Hydro temperatures in check, preventing it from overheating and ensuring peak performance at all times.

The Bitmain Antminer S19 Pro+ Hydro is expected to begin shipping in Q3 2022 (May - September), and Pre Orders will be available soon. Miners are priced at $17,500 each and a minimum order of 5 is required. A 70% prepayment is required at the time of ordering, while the remaining 30% will be due once the units are shipped.

Financing options are also available.

This isn't a GPU-related question, but one specific to BFG Miner:

I think I'm getting confused between the terminology of a block (i.e. mined every X minutes on the chain) versus BFGMiner's ""new block"" status.

I'm showing ""ST:3 F:0 NB:128""

* What is the ideal number for new block?
* Looking at the block hash just above it, that matches the hash of the block that was mined 18 minutes ago. Should it be showing a new one or does it always show the last one worked by the network?
* If that hash is actually the last block, why do I show 128 new blocks? Are these all different combinations of the next block that could be found for an acceptable share/reward?

Basically I'm not sure if my miner is stuck working on stale work. (I only have 0.41% rejected, so guessing not?)

Edit: Also seeing that I have several thousand discarded blocks. I assume this is normal as it has to restart new work?

shd5ql,wattumofficial,2,https://redd.it/shd5ql,None,Why Russia is unlikely to ban Crypto,"The Russian Central Bank has been making headlines over the last few days with reports of a possible nationwide ban on cryptocurrency and crypto mining. 

These reports come as a result of the Director of Financial Stability Elizaveta Danilova‚Äôs call to ban crypto. The central bank has since released a 37-page report outlining the reasoning behind this proposal. 

Politics are local, laws are national, and currency/value is international, and therein lies the inherent problem with the outlined proposal. 

The Report in a Nutshell 

A key criticism within the report was the market volatility of cryptocurrencies, highlighted on page 23. However, in this context the central bank fails to address activities such as gambling or stocks with the same level of scrutiny. This is the common underlying theme throughout the document, along with several other key points with similar shortcomings. The report paints crypto as one of the main destabilizing threats to the Russian economy, while loosely aided by the idea that people would invest all of their hard-earned money into Bitcoin, a high-risk asset. While the report goes into further detail, no projections or supporting documents were provided to validate such claims. 

The report goes on to mention that Bitcoin and crypto transactions in general are often used for illicit activities, on page 27. However, the reality is that any form of monetary transaction can be used for such purposes. In fact, it was recorded that in 2021,¬†only 0.15%¬†of crypto transactions were used for illicit purposes. This contradicts the claim that crypto undermines monetary policy, not to mention that it doesn‚Äôt align with Russia‚Äôs civil code, which recognizes crypto mining as a form of entrepreneurship. 

Additionally, the report raised concerns associated with crypto mining‚Äôs high energy consumption and its negative effect on the environment. This point is heavily used throughout the report as a backbone for reinforcing its stance on the crypto ban, while entirely ignoring the possibilities of exploring green and renewable energy solutions that could be researched and funded by Russia‚Äôs crypto mining industry. 

The report also seemingly throws around various claims, such as that 0.1% of all miners control over 50% of the Bitcoin mining industry in the country (page 23) without citing any credible sources for such information, and failing to acknowledge that some of the biggest miners in the country are publicly traded companies. There are a plethora of other false statements as well, including that stablecoins are not backed by anything and aren‚Äôt regulated (page 24), when in reality stablecoins like Circle USDC are fully regulated and legally redeemable. 

What is the goal of the ban? 

The proposed ban has no intent to ban crypto outright. ""We note that we do not suggest that holding cryptocurrencies by citizens be banned,"" Danilova stated according to TASS, Russia's state media, adding that there are fraud risks, as well as difficulties in asserting rights when acquiring cryptocurrency on foreign crypto exchanges. 

What the ban is targeting instead is to prohibit the issuance of tokens, crypto mining, trading activity that uses the country‚Äôs existing financial infrastructure, and prohibiting institutional investors from investing in crypto. 

Russia is currently the world‚Äôs third biggest crypto miner by hashrate, just behind the US and Kazakhstan. As mentioned earlier, crypto mining is defined and officially recognized by its civil code, and has immense potential for stimulating a significant economic growth for the nation, should it be embraced. 

Panic Amidst Misunderstanding 

To make matters worse, a number of sources have contributed to the spinning of this story by saying that Russia is banning crypto, including an¬†article by Forbes¬†that incorrectly states (and spells) that ‚ÄúRussian¬†is the third nation to¬†crackdown¬†on cryptocurrencies over the last year, following China and Kazakhstan.‚Äù The Forbes commentary isn‚Äôt true, and while Kazakhstan did face nationwide power disruptions, it in fact did not crack down on mining and crypto and, as of today, neither has Russia. 

What does it boil down to? 

While the report by the Russian Central Bank‚Äôs head of financial stability is 37 pages long, it in itself is just a proposal based on one‚Äôs fears and assumptions fueled by misinformation around issues that either do not exist or are not likely to happen. 

For such reasons, it is highly unlikely that the Russian government will take Elizaveta Danilova‚Äôs proposal seriously, as it simply lacks solutions and fails to outline any concrete next steps, not to mention that it would put the country on a backward trajectory seeing as Russia has just legalized cryptocurrencies in 2020. If such a ban were to go forward, it would reverse this legislation (which took nearly 10 years to pass), not to mention that it would take several years to implement. 

Such a decision would be counterintuitive, especially in light of recent calls by the US and its allies¬†to disconnect Russia from SWIFT¬†in the event of its invasion of Ukraine. The hypothetical situation has received widespread media coverage, and Russia‚Äôs exclusion from the international payment system would have catastrophic effects on its economy. This would in turn push Russia into mass crypto adoption. Should such events take place, it is highly unlikely that Russia would want to transact in CBDC (China‚Äôs digital currency) or the Yuan, and would instead have to rely on Bitcoin to transact with the world. 

It is likely that the Russian government understands that it would be far more beneficial to tax the mining industry rather than ban it. Such taxation would present opportunities for infrastructure expansions and reinvestments into green and renewable energy sources. Taxation could also come in the form of utility, or the licensing of mining facilities to use a Russian sponsored mining pool that would implement a tax in real time, further reinforcing the potential for significant economic growth. 

It seems that such potential is not far from being actioned on by the Russian government, with the Russian director for financial policy, Ivan Chebeskov,¬†supporting the regulation of crypto¬†as opposed to banning it. Chebeskov‚Äôs sentiment comes as a response to the central bank‚Äôs proposal, further indicating the unlikelihood of an outright ban. He further¬†outlines: ‚ÄúWe need to give these technologies the opportunity to develop. In this regard, the Ministry of Finance is actively involved in the development of legislative initiatives in terms of regulating this market.‚Äù According to Chebeskov, the ministry has prepared its own proposal, this one for the regulation of crypto and digital assets, and is awaiting feedback from the government. 

Industry Experts Weigh In 

‚ÄúThe Bank of Russia¬†conducts its activities independently¬†from other federal bodies of state power, regional authorities and local governments‚Äù, meaning they do not have a final say in local government activity and would have a hard time banning utility companies from providing power to mining operations. 

Across the entire report, crypto mining in particular is mentioned only a handful of times and within the context of energy consumption. On page 4 of the report, a brief summary of mining is provided and then swiftly dismissed as a threat to the economy: ‚ÄúIn this regard, according to the Bank of Russia, the best solution is to introduce these prohibitions on the mining of crypto-currencies.‚Äù No actionable solutions are provided, and the statement is followed by a summary of the Bank of Russia‚Äôs plan to develop their own digital currency. 

Roman Zabuga, PR director of mining hosting provider BitRiver,¬†called the probability¬†of an industry-wide ban ‚Äúnegligible‚Äù. 

A Widespread Misunderstanding 

While the call for a ban on crypto mining sounds daunting, it is important to note that this is currently no more than a proposal on behalf of the Bank of Russia, which would need to be approved by the government first. Such decisions are usually time consuming and initial proposals are often adjusted through compromise, or rejected altogether. 

Recent events in the industry have showcased a general lack of understanding for cryptocurrencies and mining on behalf of government bodies and other institutional leaders, as seen with Russia‚Äôs Central Bank. 

A recent House¬†hearing¬†on energy in crypto mining is another example, prompting Grant McCarty of Bitcoin Magazine to reiterate that¬†Congress doesn‚Äôt yet hate Bitcoin:¬†‚ÄúThis hearing didn‚Äôt signal malice on the part of Congress; it signaled a lack of education. These people just don‚Äôt know enough about Bitcoin to have that strong of an opinion yet [.]‚Äù 

In Conclusion 

The Russian Central Bank‚Äôs proposed ban is unlikely to pass as it clearly demonstrates the need for a better understanding of crypto within government bodies in order to allow for the technological advancements and economic spurts that are made possible by this developing industry. As a result, the proposal‚Äôs lack of credible sources and solutions stems from general fear, uncertainty, and doubt. 

The proposal has also prompted a swift response on behalf of Russia‚Äôs Ministry of Finance calling for proper regulation of crypto and digital assets, not a ban. President Putin has also briefly addressed this issue during a conference meeting on January 26, saying that Russia does in fact have a competitive advantage in crypto mining due to a ‚Äúsurplus of electricity and the well-trained personnel available in the country,‚Äù further adding to the improbability of a ban on crypto.

One of the hashboards seems to be shorting out, when I plug any of the 3 plugs in on that hashboard my psu shuts down and starts clicking, when i unplug it the psu fires back up. Tested another psu same problem. Tested the same psu on another machine no issues. It runs just fine with that hashboard unplugged. Now my question, before I start spending endless hours testing, is if anyone knows where I would start. My assumption is possibly a diode, but looking at the board without removing heatsyncs I see no obvious issues. My understanding is a faulty chip wouldn't cause this, as I cannot even power the board anymore.",0,bitcoinmining,2022-02-01 02:44:59

If this was the reason, why didn't temp shoots up and the miner self shut down? How could a hashboard be burnt while within 70sC?

sisimf,Kind_Caramel_8030,12,https://redd.it/sisimf,None,Is it worth mining on a BitMainTech AntMiner v1.5?,"Hi all, I recently got given a free mining rig (the one mentioned in the title obvs). Just wondering if it would be worth mining on or if it would be more profitable just selling it? I'm finding it quite difficult to find any information on setting it up and I don't think the original owner ever used it so I'm unsure about putting the effort in if it's just going to cost me more in power consumption. Any tips would be much appreciated!

(Sorry if this seems very amateur too I'm very new to all of this, I know I'll figure it out eventually but I figured it would be better to ask a community that already knows what they're doing.)",2,bitcoinmining,2022-02-02 16:14:08
siyngi,wattumofficial,1,https://redd.it/siyngi,None,How the Belt and Road Initiative can end USD dominance and create a parabolic rise in BTC adoption,"China‚Äôs Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) was first launched in 2013 by President Xi Jinping as a¬†massive infrastructure development project¬†extending from Europe to East Asia. The initiative, which has garnered the support of over 60 countries worldwide, is anticipated to significantly empower China‚Äôs economic and political influence. 

Referred to as the ‚ÄúNew Silk Road‚Äù, which rose during the Han Dynasty (206 BCE - 220 CE) and wove trade networks through what is now Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and Afghanistan, among others, the BRI roadmap includes the creation of railway networks, energy pipelines, highways, and streamlined border crossings. The original Silk Road made Central Asia one of the first epicenters of globalization, and the BRI has similar ambitions. 

What are the global implications of the BRI? 

As more countries sign on to various aspects of the BRI initiative, Syria has taken up a spot in line as well. Syria represented the first failed US intervention attempt as fellow BRI country Russia stepped in. Since Russia‚Äôs invited intervention in 2015, the Syrian government was able to take back control of nearly all of its territory from ISIS, pushing US military forces aside and negating their efforts. Should the US continue facing restricted ability to intervene abroad, its political influence would subside significantly as a direct parallel with its military presence. 

Military force isn‚Äôt the only way the BRI disrupts US dominance. The initiative can further affect dominance by ceasing USD transactions between BRI member states. In this scenario, member states would need an alternative to USD, which would most likely be a form of cryptocurrency. As such, cryptocurrency can mean that it can easily be converted to Bitcoin, using it to transact globally and in turn trigger a mass adoption of BTC. Bitcoin would thus become the de facto true global currency, even while not endowed by any one country. 

With Syria, Russia, and China united under the umbrella of the BRI, and many more nations showing interest in the initiative, the US can anticipate a decrease in influence and intervention ability which would reduce its stature greatly. 

A New Wave of Globalization 

This ‚ÄúNew Silk Road‚Äù, and thus new wave of globalization, has the potential to align with the opportunities presented by Bitcoin‚Äôs own transcension of borders, transaction speed, and swift adoption rate, propelling the digital coin to be regarded as a natural substitution for USD, as far as the global stage is concerned. 

The collapse of US dollar dominance has become a common topic of discussion, with many musing that USD could lose its status as a world reserve currency. It‚Äôs been noted that the US dollar‚Äôs status as such has been¬†declining for years, with or without the influence of cryptocurrencies. 

On the other hand, bilateral trade volume between two of the main BRI member states, Russia and China, has been steadily increasing, seeing a 31% spike in 2020 alone and exceeding $140 billion in 2021. If this volume were to be transacted in BTC instead of USD, it would most certainly propel its adoption and influence to new heights. 

How does the New Silk Road lead to Bitcoin? 

Should such a scenario unfold, and if you believe in the possibility that countries united under the BRI would edge out the US, you should think about investing in Bitcoin. Even better than investing, you should consider mining for yourself. 

If you were to buy 1 Bitcoin today, you would own 1 Bitcoin. Three years from now, whether the price of Bitcoin goes up or down, you would still own 1 Bitcoin. With mining, you will eventually get a return on your initial investment, and by that point, it becomes a passive income while it continues to mine more Bitcoins. In the end, you end up with multiple Bitcoins while your initial investment amount stays the same. 

In addition to providing passive income, Bitcoin mining hardware holds residual value that, should you sell it, would allow you to make back a portion of your initial investment. Selling your hardware also allows for an easy upgrade path to the latest units. This is the equivalent to a new iPhone model coming out; the latest model becomes available, and you can choose to sell your old one for the new version while the amount you can attain for your model remains attractive. Mining hardware is further classified as computer equipment; the IRS outlines that computer equipment is¬†tax depreciable. 

Becoming a Global Currency 

As the Belt and Road Initiative portfolio of supporters continues to grow, it is more crucial than ever for the US to remain a world reserve currency. However, expansion of the BRI initiative will make it harder to maintain this status. 

The US dollar also relies on exclusive use of the dollar by American citizens; adoption rates of Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies have soared¬†over 880%¬†in the last year, with¬†more than 40 million Americans owning a share of Bitcoin. 

Through mobile Bitcoin mining solutions, inflation hedge prospects, and a steep surge in users and investors, Bitcoin offers flexibility and autonomy that together pave the way to financial empowerment for citizens worldwide.

Before people flame. I understand that there are risks, I just don't know how risky.

I know overclocking it too much without proper cooling will kill the board but what about just a small amount with good cooling?
For example their firmware says up to 220TH obviously with immersion cooling but what about doing like 120TH or even 130TH on air cooling with winter air. Doesn't seem like that much of a stretch. 

Also how many of you use Braiins OS for overclocking? Is it better than asic.to?

I did ETH mining with gpus rigs and overclocking those are the norm so I was hoping to see if any of you overclock your ASICs within a good and safe margin and if you have had boards burn out even at low overclocks.",10,bitcoinmining,2022-02-02 22:45:08

I did spend a fair bit of time searching around but haven't been able to find any solid stuff.

I have some basic stuff like a couple 1000w PSUs, ram, rig frame etc because I was GPU mining for a bit. Long story short, all my 1080s and the mobo was fried due to saltwater in my dorm room. Tragic hard-earned 1500$ down the drain. I have in mind around 100 to 150$ to maybe start again with the still working parts I have and wondering which is better. CPU or GPU mining.

If I were to go with CPU mining, I could get a couple decent Xeons which would make around 20\~ 35$ per month, and for GPU I would only be able to get a 980 4gb and maybe a 1060 if I'm really lucky.

* Will the temperature would be an issue if I put the miners inside the box?

* If the temperature is an issue then should I use air conditioning in mining room? (Electricity cost is almost nothing)

* Cooler box or wood or plywood, which material should I use for the box?

# SMALL BITCOIN TRANSACTIONS

The proposed legislation seeks to reduce friction in the usage of bitcoin as a daily currency.

A bipartisan bill introduced Thursday would exempt bitcoin transactions from tax obligations if the associated capital gains are $200 or less, seeking to incentivize the digital currency‚Äôs usage as a medium of exchange in the U.S. economy. Currently, any gain obtained from the sale of cryptocurrency must be reported as a taxable income regardless of the size or purpose of the transaction.

sjt0j9,Bloodkaiser,10,https://redd.it/sjt0j9,None,Can you profit with ASIC?,"I have in the past build a ETH mining rig with 6 gpu's. I stopped due to not having enough time to do maintenance, as every so often the rig would crash and then get all out of whack. So made some decent profit, sold gpu's independently.

Years later now I am looking into asic mining, seems a lot more straight forward than mining with gpu's. Since asic's are specifically made to mine. After doing hours of research I have came to the conclusion that asic miners are absolutely not profitable unless you don't pay electricity.

Was looking at different miners such as antminer s9, s19j, bolon b11, whatsminer's, goldshell's, etc.

What I find is all though they profit after electricity cost. For me it's $0.04/kwh. They won't profit long enough to pay themselves off.

Every miner I've put in [BTC.com](https://btc.com/tools/mining-calculator) says ""cannot payback"".

I was excited to jump on an asic miner till I dug deeper and found out difficulty will rise as time goes on making your profits sink over time. So a miner that can theoretically be paid off in a 12-15 months because it makes good profits now won't actually make the same 6 months or 10 months down the road, making your roi time even longer or just not making it there at all.

What are your thoughts? Need advice, just what I've looked at doesn't encourage me to jump into asic mining. Would be a cool hobby but not cool if I'm in the hole $ wise.

**Hard drives** are also available for those interested.

I'm a miner myself, and in my time mining, I've built some decent relationships with suppliers. I'm frugal, especially when it comes to miners because the difference can be $100s-$1000s, because I'm able to get some competitive pricing for supply, I've decided to start retailing them.

**I believe you should see some attractive and very competitive pricing for the miners on our site**, **the savings is based on the other miners retailed on asicminervalue**

As I understand the site is new, **I have enabled PayPal checkout as well for a bit more buyer security.**

You're welcome to use credit card or bank transfer through PayPal to purchase any of the miners. **Cryptocurrency is definitely preferred and a discount can be offered.**

The prices are updated daily.

If you're from Melbourne, Australia, I'm **happy to meet in person** so we can discuss anything you would like from your mining operation to a bit more about the business. Or if you'd like happy to make new crypto friends :)

If you're an international buyer looking to purchase, I can definitely **schedule a video call** with you sometime too.

Acquired legally trough my company in the period SEP-NOV21, so all papers, import documents/invoices available, conventional payments and invoicing for sale possible, BTC is also an option. For the moment they are sold all together.

Technical info: All devices are full functional, except. 1 hashboard failure. This means that 1 1166 has a huge price reduction. Also 3 brand new PSUs and around 10 new spare fans are in the packet. I was never required to exchange any part.

Price: 5700EUR for 1246, 5200 Eur for 1166 (or equivalent in USD/Crypto), spare parts 650 Eur 

&#x200B;

How to buy: Only pick up, I pay or split your travel and accommodation costs /not 1st class/ in case of a deal rather than dealing with any of these platforms at the moment. You can come and see the devices full functional.

I've been mining bitcoin for almost 6 years and it amazes me how naive some people are with their investments. If you're going to send or purchase hardware worth thousands of dollars to someone to care for it for you, KNOW WHO YOU ARE DEALING WITH! Ask LOTS of questions... not just ""what's the price"". This isn't a new car sale. This is an ongoing relationship that requires skill, dedication, and SERVICE. Treat it as if you are renting a house, not buying something off Amazon. 

Who owns the building your machines will be in? What environment will the machine be in? What is the TEMPERATURE inside the building? Was the facility designed to host computer equipment or is a converted warehouse?  Who pays the electric bill at the facility and can they provide PROOF it is paid every month? If they don't own the building, who does? GET REFERENCES! Ask for pictures. Just because someone has a cool website, it doesn't mean they are legit. 

Lastly, for the love of God, if you are in the USA, DO NOT send your equipment to Russia for hosting! You might as well hand over your checkbook and kiss it goodbye if you do. The odds of ever seeing your equipment again are next to zero.

sn6fw2,Revolutionary_Art227,6,https://redd.it/sn6fw2,None,Thoughts on hosting your miners in Russia?,"Dear bitcoin mining community,

I represent a hosting provider in Russia, and we are interested in attracting North American clients, both retail and institutional. We can offer competitive prices for hosting and miners. I am personally based in Canada and have been mining with them since last September. I have about 3PH in used M10's, T2T's and M21S's, and just mined my second bitcoin today.

Let's imagine the current Russia FUD turns out to be unfounded, and Russia moves to legalize bitcoin mining. What barriers do you see in hosting in Russia? What would be convincing evidence that this is a legit operation that treats clients well and maintains its contractual obligations? Any ideas on how we get institutional clients? Would you be more comfortable entering into a contract with a Russian company or Canadian intermediary?

Here are the main questions I had to navigate placing an order from another country and after a while seeing my machines connected to the pool and BTC coming into my wallet:

1. **Lead times?** For miners available in stock in Irkutsk, they can be sent to a hosting facility right away. For miners sourced from Hong Kong it takes roughly 40 days by a truck, 2-3 weeks by air. We can place an order with the manufacturer directly, but then you're facing significant lead times.
2. **How does the purchase work?** Client makes 30-50% prepayment that kicks off the order, when equipment arrives at the head office it is ""received"". This reception process includes checking machine SN, measuring hash rate and power consumption at the wall, and is documented on video (sent to client afterwards). Having verified machines achieve nominal hash rates, the remainder is paid off, ownership is transferred to the client and machines sent to the hosting facility.
3. **Mining pool?** Currently all mining is set up through ViaBTC for two reasons. One is we've got their ""miner agent server"" installed locally to minimize latency/rejects. Another is our billing system is set up with ViaBTC API, allowing them to automatically account for downtime and/or reduced hashrate, while calculating a hosting bill.
4. **What is the minimal order?** Initial order needs to be at least 100kW (\~30 machines), subsequent orders can be of any quantity.  
I am thinking I can make smaller orders possible via ""shared"" orders, where I would make an order on behalf of multiple people (myself included), and payouts and invoices would be proportional to the original investment. I've been doing it so far with friends/family and can see this arrangement of benefit to some people.
5. **What if a miner needs repair?** Reach out to technical support. All facilities have permanent staff technicians that can perform maintenance and repairs as needed. Most often the issue is minor and could be resolved with a miner blown through / cleaned the contacts / etc., that's included in the hosting rate. If replacements are needed they could be typically done right away - they keep a stock of PSUs, coolers, control boards for common miners. Replacement cost is included in the next month's invoice. 
6. **How does invoicing work?** There's a 1 month pre-payment / safety deposit before miners are connected. Clients are then invoiced once a month based on actual daily uptime of individual miners. Fees are accrued proportionally to the machine's average daily hash rate, so if a miner was down or worked with reduced hash rate, the fee is adjusted accordingly. Detailed uptime report is available upon request.
7. **How do payments work?** Clients billed in USD, payments are currently done via USDT-TRC20. Other stablecoins may be considered.
8. **What if I want my equipment back?** Equipment can be re-sold back to us at a market rate or sent anywhere upon request. Clients would have to pay for the shipping costs and import tax due.

Sorry if this is a bit in depth, any ideas of how to make this process more attractive and user-friendly for international clients would be really appreciated.¬†",0,bitcoinmining,2022-02-08 00:56:16

Hi I'm from Shanghai, China. At the end of last year I got some solid connection with Whatsminer. So I started selling their miners on eBay.

The new miners are shipped directly from whatsminer so there is no broker except me.

The used miners come from a professional team (which is close to whatsminer) focusing on refurbishing whatsminer only. So the condition and performance can be guaranteed.

That's why I'm confident about the price.

All purchases go through eBay.

Compass seems good but only resale units available. Prefer new. I know their business model works by upcharging the miners but giving competitive power. 

I‚Äôve heard other services mentioned like Wattum, mining syndicate, etc..

So I guess I am wondering, what‚Äôs the best play here? Buy a miner and then find someone to host it? Which companies let you do that vs. buying from them? 

Also, a lot of focus on ROI and how they are really long right now. Once you factor in that you can depreciate your machine and I think power costs, it does not seem so bad?

so8uiq,Delicious-Heat1314,8,https://redd.it/so8uiq,None,Air Cooling Calculations,"Hey all, appreciate any help I can get. I'm sure the question has been asked before but I cant find it in any searches.

I'm looking to set up 20 miners, S19 Pro A, 3245 watts

&#x200B;

I'm going to store them inside an insulated, portable room/box measuring 1.5m x 1.5m x 2.7 m (length x width x height)

My though initially was just to set up 9 kw A/C and run it to keep them cool. Electricity cost and supply isn't a problem for me. But doing the calcs on the BTU's, the machines produce far more (understatement) than what the A/C can handle, so this would result in the room getting hotter and hotter right?

&#x200B;

So I will vent the hot air out of the room via ducting connected directly to the miners and still bring cold air in via the A/C, probably a smaller size.

&#x200B;

Assume the ambient temperature (before adding the miners) in the room is 30 degrees Celsius in summer, and I have the the A/C set to its lowest at 18 degrees. Now also assume all the miners are ducted so all/most hot air caused by the miners is removed.

What is the likely exit temperature of the heat coming out of the fans and exiting via the ducting? I want to make sure the factory I'm putting this server box/room inside of wont heat up to much in summer.

Would I need to vent the hot air out of the building or would the A/C do its job and cool it down enough?

&#x200B;

Thought was also to use the heat generated to heat the space in winter, but im not sure how to setup a ducting system that I can put a diversion on, would need to be done remotely via a wifi connection or something similar.

There are a lot of people who don't trust me, and now that I've posted my company's procurement contract, I'm sure no other company will provide you with this kind of proof.

You can ask your dealer if they can provide you with a purchase contract. If there is no way to provide a purchase contract, then their L7 is not directly sourced from bitmain, there are very few L7s in stock at the moment, and the level 1 dealers' miners will supply their own customers first, so there are many dealers who do not have the means to ship soon.

I have an AvalonMiner 1246 that needs to live in my laundry room, which is only a few feet from my office desk (where I work full time). 

I would like to get this thing to run at a temperature and noise level that is comfortable. 

I will have the laundry room doors closed. I will put up acoustic foam on the inside of the doors and walls. 

I would also like to build a cooler out to insulate some of the noise. My idea is to put the miner in a big cooler (the kind you take to the beach), and drill holes for insulated ducts to connect to the fans. I will pipe the ducts only a foot or two, to a vent in the wall (which goes straight through the wall with no attachment to the AC). 

So firstly, is that a sound idea? I saw a few similar setups on youtube, thought I'd give it a go.

Secondly, I am having trouble wrapping my head around how to connect the ducts to the fans. Everyone else who does this that I can find has miner with only one fan on each side, and connect the hose straight to it. But my miner has two fans on each side. I was looking for a shroud or some sort of transition duct, but all I can find is cheap 3d-printed shrouds, or transitions for standard 3 1/4 x 10, whereas my fans are 5x10. Any ideas?

RMA reason for return was ""no longer needed"" since the Newegg app drop down menu had no option for ""item defective"". Customer service representative said this will likely cause my claim to fail.

sskgf6,TacoShopRs,3,https://redd.it/sskgf6,None,Anyone using Braiins os+ for S19's? Also Vnish firmware results and review,"I have been using vnish firmware for overclocking my S19 Pro's and I personally like it, but I do not have anything to compare it to. I am currently doing 127.5TH and 123.2TH on air cooling at between 3700W-3950W depending on how cool it is. It did hit 3600W when it was very cold yesterday(-18c). I would push it more but I only installed 20 amp breakers not 30 amps (Never really thought of this scenario when I had it installed). 

I was wondering how Braiins os+ compares, but I just received the firmware but they told me about a few things that would be a deal breaker for me so I have not installed it.

First ""The estimated power consumption in the web GUI is NOT accurate, and therefore the efficiency estimate is not accurate either. In order to know the true power consumption and efficiency, you must measure power consumption at the wall with a wattmeter or monitoring software.""  If I had 30 amps this wouldn't be a problem but I don't want to risk it with 20amps.

Second ""Additionally, temperature has a significant impact on efficiency for Antminer X19‚Äôs, more so than it did for previous hardware generations. For this reason, the fans will run at 100% by default during autotuning for air-cooled devices.""
I'm not sure if they mean only during the autotuning and then changes after the setup is done or it will blast at 100% at all times. It is not very clear on that. On vnish firmware I am currently running my fans on auto with 70c max and it is running at 30% fanspeed currently and has not gone over 70% fanspeed since I started a week and half ago. 

So if anyone has some insight or opinions on Braiins OS+ for S19's please let me know! Also if anyone has any questions about using the Vnish firmware, ask and I'll answer to the best of my ability. (I'm not very educated in this field but I'll answer what I can.)",6,bitcoinmining,2022-02-14 20:27:58

sthtia,Spaceduck413,38,https://redd.it/sthtia,None,Considering Jumping In,"Hi everyone,
I've been GPU mining for a while now, but with Eth 2.0  on the horizon, I'm considering investing in some asics as a hedge.

My concern is that there seems to be a lot of conflicting information and I'm having trouble figuring out what's reliable, so I was hoping some kind soul who is actually mining would answer a few questions.

Mainly, I hear people say that the network hash rate increases so rapidly that you end up in a constant cycle of replacing miners. Is this true in your experience? How quickly do you see Bitcoin mined at a given hashrate fall off? 

I'm also curious how many of you are just plain mining and holding, how many are mining and selling off enough to cover expenses, and how many are mining and selling all or most to generate a passive income.

Also, I realize I'm on the Bitcoin mining sub, but was wondering if anybody mines any of the other SHA-256 coins out there.

Finally, I know antminer is the big name everyone knows, but is it really the best? Have you had bad experiences, or are there other brands you would recommend?

So I was wondering if I should have openings for intake and for exhausts, because I'm gonna install an air conditioner in there because I would need it in summers no matter the amount of airflow because it gets super hot in here. Now in winters I could run it without the ac but I'm afraid of fog if I let the air in, because if condensation happens on asic then I'm basically done for. And since I don't live there (I do have a younger cousin who can look after it) I'm skeptical about letter the air in in winters cuz of fog and like I won't be there to constantly keep watch. 

1) So should I just run the ac all year around or should I leave the opening (like windows) for air flow and install exhaust.
2) Also when I run the ac in the summers, should I keep the air flow, like keep the exhaust on (seems dumb cuz cold air will escape but correct me of I'm wrong) or should I keep it all closed up?",1,bitcoinmining,2022-02-20 07:21:18

sy6ati,wattumofficial,1,https://redd.it/sy6ati,None,Bitcoin miners exempt from IRS reporting rules: US Treasury Addresses miner concerns,"On January 26, 2022,¬†eleven US representatives wrote to¬†US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen in response to the¬†Infrastructure Investment in Jobs Act‚Äôs definition of a ‚Äúbroker‚Äù, which they claimed was not fairly applicable to the nature of work carried out in the crypto industry. 

The Broadly Defined ‚ÄúBroker‚Äù 

The¬†Act¬†outlined that brokers would be required to collect detailed information about their customers and their trades, with those participating in crypto and the blockchain network included in the ‚Äúbroker‚Äù¬†definition. It would have imposed unnecessary tax reporting burdens on crypto miners and stakers who don‚Äôt usually deal directly with their customers and do not have ready access to such information. 

Crypto Miners and Stakers To Be Exempt 

The US Treasury Department has since addressed these concerns, and on February 11, 2022 responded with a letter that¬†indicated crypto miners and stakers will not be subject¬†to the tax reporting requirements that will be implemented on exchanges. 

The Treasury implied that the requirements would pertain only to those who already have access to and use such detailed customer information: ‚ÄúExisting regulations impose broker reporting obligations only on market participants engaged in business activities that provide them with access to information about sales of securities by taxpayers.‚Äù 

The letter, written by Jonathan Davidson, an assistant Treasury secretary for legislative affairs, further clarified that ‚Äúancillary parties who cannot get access to information that is useful to the IRS (Internal Revenue Service) are not intended to be captured by the reporting requirements for brokers.‚Äù 

This clarification comes as a relief to active members in the crypto industry, considering that an overly broad definition could be impossible for many participants to act in accordance with. 

Proposed Regulations and Next Steps 

The U.S. Treasury Department plans to issue additional proposed regulations that will reflect how a broker is defined. This issuance will follow a rulemaking process similar to those followed for other regulations that are implemented at the federal level. 

The crypto industry collectively made its concerns surrounding the¬†Infrastructure Investment in Jobs Act‚Äôs broker definition heard, and these concerns were thus acknowledged and acted on. There are significant implications to be drawn here, pertaining to the role and presence of crypto actors becoming legitimized for future legislative decisions, especially when it comes to crypto activity.

Buy bitcoin at the current price of ~$38.4k = ~2.6 bitcoin. At $100k, would be worth $260k so total profit of $160k

Mine bitcoin. S19J 100T/3050W is going for about $10k each on compass. so 10 S19J or 1000T/30500W and let's assume electricity cost of $0.05 KW
 
Revenue = (1000/current total hash rate * 6.25 * 105120 [# of 10min periods in 2 years]) = ~3.17 BTC

Expenses (Electricity) = (30500/1000) * $.05 * 17520[# of hours in 2 years] = $26.7k or ~.70 BTC at current price

Profit = 3.17 - .70 = ~2.47 BTC = $247,000 [value @ $100k] - $100,000 [machine cost] = $148,000 in total profit which doesn't take into account total hash rate/difficulty increases, hosting fees, pool fees, etc. which would significantly reduce the profit figures here which are already looking worse than just buying.

szrp6d,bcrawl91,20,https://redd.it/szrp6d,None,Bitcoin Mining vs Buying Bitcoin? The truth.,"Hi all,

Every day I see discussion on buying vs mining, so I thought I would provide a detailed explanation. I see inconsistency and inaccuracy in responses and it is killing me. In no way am I saying that I know everything, I am always learning, but here is my attempt to answer the question on mining vs buying.

# Answer

Anyone can profit from mining, but it will come down to the individual running it and their initial capital investment.

I think most people understand this, but maybe not the 'why?'

# Detailed Response

Mining should be treated how any business should be. Understand your long term vision, understand the market you are operating in, and do anything you can to hit your objectives and beat competitors.

I am going to talk about the key variables of impact on mining that people need to wrap their head around as they are the levers you need to always pull to maintain a competitive advantage.

**Difficulty**

The greater the hash power on the network the greater the difficulty. If you look at past %inctrease it is about 4.7%. With the upcoming projects from the big players in the market, most forecasts are saying a double in hash rate by the end of 2022 (\~7-8% increase / month).

This increase is clearly diminishing your returns and depreciating your equipment. This is concerning because it will always tighten margins.

*So what lever can you pull to control difficulty?*

While you cannot control the amount it increases by, you can ensure you always beat the increase %. This will help determine your initial capital investment. If someone buys one miner, I can almost guarantee you would have been better off purchasing BTC from the start. But if you purchase 10 S19j Pros you will have 1040th, after one month if you reinvest the returns in another s19j pro you have just increased your hash rate by 10%. You will always be ahead of the game.

Companies work similar in borrowing money to invest in capital for growth, if they don't opt to do that, they lower their value and lose their spot in the market.

**Crypto Price**

I am not going to be long winded on this. The greater the price increase, the more beneficial mining is.

*So what lever can you pull to control Crypto price?*

Obviously you have no control over this. If you find a way please let me know.

**Electrical Infrastructure**

I have mentioned this to a few people, but you need to understand full opex expense to actually understand price/kwh. I know a person who had 5c/kwh in 2018 and couldn't understand how people were staying open. If you added up their rent, repair costs, general business expenses, it basically rounded up their all in electricity cost to 9c/kwh. This was only \~250kwh space, so not significant, but you get the picture.

Work out all expenses not just your electricity prices and determine if it is feasible. I would be cautious on >10c/kwh.

To put into context, an s19j pro 104t on 5c/kwh vs 10c/kwh is $100 difference/month. Doesn't sound like much, but the intent is to scale so this is consistently multiplying.

*So what lever can you pull to control electrical infrastructure?*

This is completely in your power and is what gives the big players competitive advantage through economies of scale. First finding infrastructure capable to support significant base loads can be a challenge in itself, and the rent price can boost your all in c/kwh significantly. Second, If you are a large enough operation it becomes more and more complex with energy trading, supply agreements, PPA's, etc.

**Technology Advancement**

This one is tough, it basically increases your challenge to keep up with hash rate (consider moores law). It is basically causing your equipment to become redundant over time. Ideally you want to aim for 5 years of turning profit, but with mining becoming more competitive, I am not sure if those days still exist.

*So what lever can you pull to control technology advancement?*

The key control you have is determining if it is value add to sell equipment after 2-3 years and upgrade to the latest tech. It can be difficult to embed this within a financial model because it introduces a heap of other variables.

**Other considerations**

Payback period of equipment - should be less than 1 year based on current profit rates. If you are paying more you challenge scaleability which will counter difficulty increase.

Efficiency - with margins bound to tighten this year and next year, running the most efficient equipment will be a huge competitive advantage. Old equipment will retire first.

Other technologies - Increase in hashrate does not always need to come from more miners. e.g. you could have 8 S19j pros and instead of ordering another one you purchase an immersion cooler. Not only would this provide \~30% hash rate, but it also provides flexibility if margins tighten to reduce energy output by \~20% for stock hash rate..

**Long term thinking**

This business is not to make a quick buck. While plenty of people have, it will continue to increase in difficulty to do so.

What position will you be in for the next halving event? Are you confident in the price increase that much to offset the halving effect?

Are you better off looking at your own powerstation. The perfect sites that have high solar potential, high wind potential, along with grid proximity and capacity. At least you can sell electricity to the grid, it is a safer asset with better borrowing potential, and you can look to government grants and incentives in renewables. Bonus flexibility and business diversification.

Whats the end game? At what difficulty increase % per month will you call it quits and sell your equipment? It will continue to operate like a free market and we will see mergers, acquisitions and all sorts from the big companies.

**Closing comment**

Don't take my word for the above spiel. You literally need to create your own model, do sensitivity analysis, understand variable relationships and decide for yourself.

If you don't know how to model, learn it.

Hope this helps with consideration of what to do and if mining is for you. I labelled it 'the truth' but it is obviously just my opinion of 'the truth', so I am sure some people will agree or disagree and that is all good.

If you managed to read this far, congratulations! Please comment the following so I know if it was worth it ""Knowledge is knowing a tomato is a fruit. Wisdom is not putting it in a fruit salad""

I'm looking to purchase 2-3 bitmain S19's (100 -110 TH) and need help with the setup and hosting. I would prefer not to have to make a minimum purchase of 10+ miners I've seen some groups require. I'd also like to own the equipment, not do cloud mining. 

I'm located in Texas, and I'm doing this through a company so I don't want to deal with sales tax or nexus in another country. United States (preferably Texas) would be great. 

Any other considerations I should be thinking of would be greatly appreciated as well.

= differential in energy price that I pay vs what I charge the customer.

=anything else?  


**On costs**

=some overheads / personnel costs for taking care of the machines

=setting up the facility

Any key thing that I forgot? Is the customer the average Joe or a Bitcoin mining facility? Assume space is very scarce and in high demand and therefore you would need to commit many ASICs. Any experience anyone?

t0hs2j,didymus_1,9,https://redd.it/t0hs2j,None,Working on a Project to help Bitcoin miners understand their power costs,"Hey r/BitcoinMining 

When I was first getting started I spent hours trying to dissect my local energy provider‚Äôs rate schedules and classification policies to determine if I could mine competitively in my current location (in the US). Not only did I have to dive into jargon-filled legal documents defining pricing, but I also had to discuss classifications and rates with dozens of representatives from our power company to finally come away with some tangible models. In the process, I learned a ton about how pricing is calculated and how the energy companies think about servicing their customers. **The good news is that most power companies operate and price in a quite similar way. I felt like what I learned would be super useful to other current and future miners out there.** 

**What I want to do is put together a comprehensive tool for identifying what your best option is for power ($/kwh) in your location.** I imagine this as a simple calculator tool where you enter the type and number of machines you plan on using, your location or local utility, and we can determine what your projected rate will be, which rate schedule you'd ideally fall under, and some assistance in how to negotiate with your utility to be classified accordingly.

This is pretty doable in theory, as I've already built this for myself and gone through the process with my power company and multiple other miners on our grid. What I want to know from this community is:

1. Would something like this be useful for you now, or when you were getting started?
2. What power companies / locations should I include in the first iteration of this tool? I'm happy to go through the detail with anyone interested or if there are some obvious ways to filter that I'm not considering. My plan is to do a naive search across each of the 50 states for ""top power companies"" and ingesting their rates into the calculator as a first pass. Open to alternative suggestions.
3. Is anyone interested in providing feedback / testing this as I iterate? Open to any and all collaboration

The goal of this project is to make it simple and quick for bitcoin miners to understand their energy grid and how they‚Äôd fit in the the currently offered rate schedules. I think strong coordination between bitcoin miners is the best strategy going forward so any and all feedback is appreciated. Note again, this is a tool that I'm focused on for the US currently, simply because I understand how our pricing works. Happily open to including other locations as well in the future.

Thanks! Any feedback and/or criticisms of this approach are welcome.",12,bitcoinmining,2022-02-24 18:26:06

Logs show an error ""ERROR\_SOC\_INIT: soc init failed!"". Researching online I've found it might be a power supply issue possibly. I'm getting 0 hash power and the hashboards seem to be working fine (logs show it finds 76 asic which is standard for each board) but ends up shutting each board down in the boot process. I've tried reconnecting all the wires and hashboards, reverting to factory firmware then updating firmware and still have the same issue. I'm thinking to try flashing with an sd card but I'm not sure if that will really help in my situation. Any help or input is appreciated I'm really not sure where to go from here.

t0of6w,plotikai,2,https://redd.it/t0of6w,None,How do I power an AvalonMiner 1246,"Hey everyone, im new to the space and have been interested in learning more about it. I bought an AvalonMiner 1246 used to test the waters but don't really know what I need to do when it comes to power. Can someone point me in a direction for me to read up on it a bit more?

I have one miner right now but I would like to set this up to expand so I want to do it right the first time. I have a shed on the property with 200a service and plan on filling it up as I climb this learning curve. Here is what I think I need:

\- 30a circuit per miner      
\- L2620 socket      
\- PDU with c13 outlets      
\- Networking switch

Is that all I need to get started?

Is this PDU good enough to get started?

This PDU has 8 spots so assuming I populate all of them I should be able to saturate my panel. Do I supply the PDU with all 200a of service or should I have each miner on a different circuit? Id like to buy all the gear I need and have some competence on the subject before bringing in my electrician for installation.

How should I monitor power usage? I see different options like ""smart"" PDUs or inline monitoring, what's the best practice? Is there a well-known option for remote monitoring (I don't want to go back and forth to my shed all the time)?",1,bitcoinmining,2022-02-24 23:18:46
t0pcex,chistescortos,0,https://redd.it/t0pcex,None,Putin is not helping bitcoin,"One more war has arrived, **very striking because Russia is the main protagonist**, and it is curious in this scenario, what can happen to bitcoin.¬†

The fall recorded by the price of the cryptocurrency on Thursday morning, February 24, suggests that **investors are not looking for a shelter value in it**, on the contrary, **it is the precious metals such as gold and silver that are the ones that capture the attention**, which is surprising, especially in the face of the strength that has had, in the last year, the narrative of bitcoin as the ""digital gold"" of our era.

But the charts don't lie. When comparing the prices of gold and bitcoin, the cryptocurrency does not stand up well as a shelter value alternative for those who want to hedge against the effects of a war like the one that started yesterday between Russia and Ukraine. **Although bitcoin is recovering from its shocking 8% drop in price in the morning hours, gold has managed to gain 3.4% in value in the last 24 hours**.

While as this article is being written the price of bitcoin is climbing to $40,000 per unit, when we compare gold and bitcoin prices since 2019, the numbers speak for themselves. While gold has had an ever-steady growth in value and has maintained stable prices, **bitcoin stands out for its marked volatility that does not cease to be affected in the face of the current global outlook**.

The panic and speculation in the bitcoin market **contradict the belief that the cryptocurrency is currently replacing gold as a shelter value**, becoming a financial alternative in the face of the uncertainty of the global economy and the devaluation of fiat currencies, all this reinforced by the adoption of bitcoin in countries such as Venezuela, Argentina or El Salvador, as a ""currency of exchange"", as well as its sustained growth during the pandemic.

While events such as these suggest that bitcoin can be used as a store of value, the stark reality is that today, **bitcoin is nothing more than a risk asset**. Volatility in its price has always been an intrinsic characteristic of the cryptocurrency that still needs to mature much more for it to be considered a safe investment alternative.

In this sense, bitcoin, rather than an asset that serves to maintain the true value of any capital, **is behaving as a speculative vehicle of high volatility** and this is a feature that, without a doubt, can alienate large investors who are looking for something to protect them from the great uncertainty generated by geopolitical events of global impact such as Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

Vijay Ayyar - vice president of the Luno exchange - considers **that bitcoin is still at an early stage of its maturity, so it is still too early to consider it the new ""digital gold""**.

It is clear that the current geopolitical situation will not help bitcoin's price recovery and will undoubtedly increase its volatility. **Given these forecasts, it is hardly understandable that people who are looking for ways to mobilize their money from Ukraine and other parts of the world**, to safeguard their capital, are not thinking of bitcoin as the first alternative.

**But it's not all bad for bitcoin** 

Despite all the forecasts, **bitcoin meets the characteristics of this type of financial product**, so the recent slumps in its price should not affect its reputation earned so far as ""the digital gold of the future"".

In short, in a few years and in other scenarios, **bitcoin is likely to become the ""investment of choice"" when geopolitical conflicts occur**, even though, at present, the financial safeguard that bitcoin can offer is very limited.

If we review **the characteristics that make an asset a shelter value**, we can note that the cryptocurrency meets most of these requirements:¬†

**‚óè Trust**  
**‚óè Limited supply**  
**‚óè Low storage cost**  
**‚óè Easy transmission and durability of its value** 

**But it is precisely this last element that is failing to a greater extent in the narrative of bitcoin as the new digital gold**, since, although in the long term the cryptocurrency continues to gain value, in the short term its price fluctuates rapidly and is not maintained enough to generate security in investors.

In contrast, **gold continues to prove that it offers security and stability**, something that bitcoin is currently unable to offer. While bitcoin can appreciate more than the precious metal in a matter of hours, it can also lose all of its gains just as quickly.

However, the deflationary nature of the cryptocurrency, its fully transparent record of transactions, its resistance to censorship, and its ease of exchange, **make bitcoin a versatile financial product that, in the long run, will continue to attract the attention of those interested in safeguarding their capital** against all kinds of unforeseen events.

**The ability of bitcoin to give citizens power over their money while resisting censorship and authoritarianism** is undoubtedly an attractive factor for many investors, from the smallest to the most powerful.

Because of its digital and private essence, **cryptocurrency can become an ally of the politically persecuted, refugees, and all those people who want to keep their money out of the totalitarian power of governments and of course, banks**.

t2l1f0,VBNerd21,62,https://redd.it/t2l1f0,None,Home Mining Setup,"Home Mining Setup: 10 Bitmain S19 Pros: Around 6k monthly income. 3k profit.

When I was first starting to learn how to mine I was starting from ground zero and had no idea what to do. I had to learn the hard way. So I wanted to share my setup here for anyone who would like to try and build a home garage mining setup.

Miners: I bought all my miners off of eBay and Amazon. Had a pretty good experience with both. Just be careful of spammers and check reviews and their reputation. This is a very helpful website for determining which miners you want to get and how much you can expect to make each day. 

[https://whattomine.com/miners](https://whattomine.com/miners)

Electrical: $15-20k

I had to call an electrician out to install 20 240 volt outlets as each miner uses two plugs. They also installed a 400 Amp Residential Service and a dedicated power panel with each breaker matching up to one outlet. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZi\_yx\_koXc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZi_yx_koXc) was a really good video that helped me on what to say to the electrician.

Heat:

The heat thrown off by these miners is no joke. My garage went from 70-120 degrees in about an hour just from 3 of these running when I was dumb and tried to use a couple portable window AC units. I learned it‚Äôs way more important to get the hot air out rather than making the futile attempt to cool the space. With that being said I still got a mini-split Air Conditioner installed in the garage in order to constantly push in 60 degree air. 

Mini split: $7k: Carrier z Performance High Wall: 38MAQB18R--3 with 40MAQB18B--3: 17500 Btu 20 SEER 12.5 EER Heat Pump. 

Even with the mini-split though it was still getting too hot. So I had the idea of using a grow tent to push and contain all the hot air and then using fans to shoot it out of the garage. This finally worked since the mini-split was pushing a ton of cold air into the garage and the grow tent contained and pushed out all the hot air. 

Grow tent: 569.95: [https://www.amazon.com/ULTRA-YIELD-Extension-Grow-Tent/dp/B0883DH17T](https://www.amazon.com/ULTRA-YIELD-Extension-Grow-Tent/dp/B0883DH17T?ref_=ast_sto_dp&th=1&psc=1)

Fans: $900: I had to set up 3 10 inch AC Infinity Fans hanging inside the tent to suck all the air out. [https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07XBV5JY1/](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07XBV5JY1/)

Ducting: $150: [https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0845MBBYV](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0845MBBYV)

Noise:

ASIC miners are extremely loud. I live in a neighborhood with noise ordinances and would definitely have the cops show up if I didn‚Äôt take steps to dampen the noise.

Acoustic tiles: $200

[https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07D6SC1QM](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07D6SC1QM)

I lined my garage door and the wall above it with these acoustic tiles but it was still too loud.

Custom Fan Silencers: $480

[https://www.etsy.com/listing/1052041865/mega-max-airflow-for-double-fan-120mm](https://www.etsy.com/listing/1052041865/mega-max-airflow-for-double-fan-120mm)

I bought and installed these onto both sides of the miner. Needed 40. 4 for each miner.

Still too loud. 

Duct Silencers: $600

[https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07TL7WJ13](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07TL7WJ13)

These things were great. Finally unable to hear the mining operation beyond about 10 feet from my garage. 

Networking:

You don‚Äôt need to run networking cable to your space. Just spend $40 and get these power over ethernet adapters. 

[https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B084CZMYNM](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B084CZMYNM)

24 Port Switch

[https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0779R9LJ3](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0779R9LJ3)

I have a networking background but even if you don‚Äôt it is super simple. Plug the networking cables in to the switch, plug the switch into the PoE adapter, Plug your router into the poe adapter and it is a super easy setup.

Mining:

I just used NiceHash. Nicehash.com. They make it super simple to start mining within minutes and pay out every 4 hours I believe in BTC. 

Monthly Electrical Cost: 3k

Right now it makes a profit of about 3k a month if I needed to use the BTC but back at all time highs it was making around 10-12k a month and 8-9k a month in profit. I also had a solar system installed which was about 60k but it only covers about 200 bucks a month of the electric bill so that was a flop. I would need about 10 times the amount of solar panels. Maybe someday I‚Äôll get a farm and cover it with solar panels lol. 

I tried posting some pictures but it got flagged or something and wouldn‚Äôt post. I‚Äôm sure I forgot some stuff but hopefully this can help someone out there searching for how to mine at home. Good luck.",37,bitcoinmining,2022-02-27 10:00:01

t3nomc,wattumofficial,18,https://redd.it/t3nomc,None,Ethereum Shifts to Proof of Stake: Its Effect on the ASIC Market," 

Ethereum Shifts to Proof of Stake: Its Effect on the ASIC Market

Ethereum is moving to proof of stake. With plans to phase out of proof of work and transition into ‚ÄúThe Merge‚Äù (formerly known as ETH 2.0) as soon as June 2022 (mid-Q2, or whatever), there are broader implications for both Ethereum and Bitcoin miners ‚Äì as well as the ASIC market ‚Äì so it‚Äôs important to understand: what is the difference between proof of work and proof of stake, and why should you care?¬†

Proof of work (PoW), the current [consensus mechanism](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/consensus-mechanisms/) used most notably in mining Ethereum and Bitcoin, refers to the underlying algorithm that sets the difficulty and rules for work performed by miners, with ‚Äúwork‚Äù referring to mining itself. According to Ethereum‚Äôs website, [PoW](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/consensus-mechanisms/pow/) is important because ‚Äúthe chain‚Äôs length helps the network follow the correct Ethereum chain and understand Ethereum‚Äôs current state. The more ‚Äòwork‚Äô done, the longer the chain, and the higher the block number, the more certain the network can be of the current state of things.‚Äù

Proof of stake (PoS), on the other hand, is performed by validators who have staked ETH in order to participate in the system. Chosen at random, a validator creates new blocks and shares them with the network, earning rewards. Intense computational work isn‚Äôt necessary as you simply need to have staked your ETH in the network, which is what incentivises healthy network behavior. PoS also requires users to stake their ETH in order to become a validator, who is responsible for the same thing as miners in PoW: ordering transactions and creating new blocks so that all nodes can agree on the state of the network.

*TLDR: PoS (Future) = No more mining, PoW (Present, about to be extinct) = GPU Mining*

## Ethereum is Moving to PoS‚Ä¶ Again

Ethereum‚Äôs transition to PoS, referred to as ‚ÄúThe Merge‚Äù or ETH 2.0, is not a recent development. Beginning in 2017, it was originally planned for launch in 2019. Fast forward to 2022, there seems to be much more confidence circulating around this topic, so why are we talking about it again?¬†

Before we jump into the history lesson, let‚Äôs clear up some of the terminology. The Merge refers to the merging of all of the history of ETH 1.0 (all coins, everything) into the ETH 2.0 chain. Once that happens, the mining of Ethereum is no more and the entire blockchain is run by the validator nodes. Of course, if Ethereum can no longer be mined, there is no use for GPUs outside of gaming and the mining of alternative coins, such as Ravencoin, Flux and others. While you can continue mining these coins, the long term profitability is highly questionable and is likely to plummet with the demise of Ethereum mining as we know it. But we‚Äôll get to that in a minute.¬†

The purpose of a transition to PoS is to make Ethereum scalable, more secure, and more sustainable. No mining means eco-friendly. What makes this scalability possible is something called ‚Äúshard chains‚Äù. Shard chains, or sharding, [is a scaling mechanism](https://ethereum.org/en/upgrades/shard-chains/) that is anticipated to go live in 2023. Instead of dealing with the entire blockchain at the same time, you deal in pieces (think ‚Äúshards‚Äù of glass). The purpose of shard chains is to build a more resilient and more scalable blockchain network.

## A Better Picture

It‚Äôs important to understand that a transition to PoS from PoW is just that ‚Äì a transition. PoS presents improvements to the PoW model, merging first before being entirely replaced, as demonstrated in the graphic below. These improvements include improved energy efficiency (as you no longer need energy to *mine* blocks), fewer hardware requirements for creating new blocks, and stronger support for the aforementioned shard chains (the key player in scaling the Ethereum network). A transition to proof of stake is also expected to result in more nodes in the network, which significantly improves resistance to centralization.

 

## The Merge and The Aftermath

*It‚Äôs June 2022 and Ethereum has moved to proof of stake.* What happened to all of the miners who were using GPUs to mine Ethereum? Well, since mining rigs are purpose-built, meaning they‚Äôre better for mining one specific coin, the GPUs went back into the hands of gamers while crypto miners dove head first into the ASIC market.¬†

A significant rise in demand for ASIC mining equipment once Ethereum officially transitions to PoS is not hard to imagine, and that demand is likely to outpace the available supply ‚Äì a supply which has already been affected by global supply chain disruptions due to Covid-19.

The last 18 months have been very profitable for ETH miners in particular. Many of them began their mining journeys with their personal gaming computers, and have since significantly expanded their mining arsenals by building dedicated GPU mining rigs and farms. This was their first foray into full-time crypto mining, so what now? Well, there‚Äôs a slim chance they‚Äôll be willing to give that up, and it‚Äôs very likely they‚Äôll keep mining simply because they know mining works. It was these 18 months that helped people see the profit potential, and further turned those who were just exploring their curiosity into hardcore miners.

In light of The Merge, it won‚Äôt come as a surprise when these miners sell their used GPUs (gamers rejoice) and start buying ASICs, transitioning to Bitcoin mining. If you‚Äôre following our line of logic, an increase in demand and a decrease in supply will cause ASIC prices to jump, making it increasingly difficult to obtain a miner.

## All Roads Lead to Rome

A new wave of buyers is on the way. The influx of GPUs on the secondhand market once the merge occurs will have gamers rejoicing, but they‚Äôll be practically useless for crypto mining. With attention turning to ASICs and Q2 just around the corner, it doesn‚Äôt hurt to start thinking about buying an ASIC today to avoid FOMO in the future.¬†

Bitcoin and Ethereum are not only the top 2 coins based on [market cap](https://uk.advfn.com/cryptocurrency), they‚Äôre also the top 2 mineable coins. Ethereum‚Äôs market cap is half of Bitcoin‚Äôs ‚Äì based on this alone, considering that market cap correlates with the number of miners per coin, it can be assumed that Ethereum has about half as many miners as Bitcoin.¬†

In translation? Bitcoin is about to gain 50% more miners, and they‚Äôre all coming from Ethereum.

t3pcwo,gusmeowmeow,10,https://redd.it/t3pcwo,None,Compass Mining,"Does anyone have experience with [compassmining.io](https://compassmining.io/)? By all accounts (well at least by the accounts of some popular mining Youtubers) they are a legitimate company that sell ASIC miners. But they also offer hosting solutions where your ASIC unit is sent to one of several dozen mining facilities in US, Canada, & Russia (although the latter might not be the best option atm). This seems like a decent option for someone like myself who would love to pick up an ASIC but can't really accommodate the operation of one at home. I was ready to pull the trigger but after speaking to one of their sales reps, it turns out that they seems very reluctant to disclose the location of the facilities where your miner ends up. You can choose the facility as per the list [here](https://compassmining.io/facilities) but it doesn't get any more specific than the state or province and they insist that they cannot share additional details about the location like the city, much less the address, or even the direct contact info for ""security reasons"". While I am definitely sympathetic to the security concerns, this seems like a red flag.

t3r8kc,Brunnervac,26,https://redd.it/t3r8kc,None,Wattum Management - two facilities offline for months and extreme difficulty to receive deposits or miners back,"[This is my follow up review of Wattum Management from December 2021.](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMining/comments/rdmv17/wattum_management_bitcoin_mining_farm_review/)

New York Petawatt facility went offline in mid December. Wattum was promising to go back live for weeks and blamed some technical issues. Then one miner went for a visit and reported that facility has power, is normally hashing, but only Wattum containers are without power. We will never learn what really happened.   


Getting a pre-paid deposit or pre-paid hosting is extremely difficult. Wattum is dragging a feet. Requiring signing strict Confidentiality agreement with penalties for disclosing anything about their situation or termination of agreement.   


Similar situation is happening in Kazakhstan. Anyone who tried to get miner out of Wattum/Enegix facility wasn't successful so far. Wattum always delays the process. It is like a running joke.. waiting for legal, next week, or Friday, or Monday, or week after that... dragging for months.   


What we learned so far:  
The miners we bought and paid for are not in our name. They are on Wattum or Enegix books. Basically we cannot move them as we want. If we want to move them we need to do customs processig, pay import taxes... because Wattum never did it.",26,bitcoinmining,2022-02-28 22:02:48

**Frequently Asked Question Regarding Cryptocurrency Mining-**

√ò **Is crypto mining illegal?**

The legality of Bitcoin mining depends entirely on your geographic location. The concept of Bitcoin can threaten the dominance of fiat currencies and government control over the financial markets. For this reason, Bitcoin is completely illegal in certain places.

√ò **Is crypto mining profitable?**

As time goes on, mining Bitcoin becomes more difficult, as more miners compete for the next block reward. Today, mining Bitcoin as an individual is rarely profitable unless someone has access to extra low-cost electricity.

√ò **How long does it take to mine 1 Bitcoin?**

It takes about 10 minutes to mine one bitcoin.

Currently, it's 1 x 2pole 30 tied to 2 outlets that feed the 2 cords for the miner. Basically a custom ""from scratch"" pdu.

Code enforcement wants us to install 1 x 2 pole 15A breaker for EACH cord of an s19j pro, his first suggestion was to stack 2 2poles vertically.... in a 3 phase panel...
I'm not even commenting on that. 

The facility is 208, trust me I've fought tooth and nail to change it but it's not in the books for this phase.


So blues reasoning is because a c13 is rated for 15A max, which I understand whole heartedly.... I AM an electrician.
But when I look around at all of these listed reputable PDUs designed for crypto and even the s19 specifically, they all have upstream overcurrent protection that's higher than the rating of the c13. 

So I'm feeling I'm missing something here, maybe even something in the NEC.

After 26, I am planning to rent another location and build another farm with another 26 S9s and so on. I am keeping the locations to 26 because I pretty much have free electricity (I have a fixed contract in which I only pay around 35 USD per month), but I don't want to overwhelm the local grid and cause a blackout. The cheap or close to free electricity is also the reason I am mining with S9s and not other miners.

However, recently I've been thinking if it's a smart decision on my end to keep scaling my mining venture solely with S9s. I mean, after looking at other miners with my electricity situation, the S9s are still the most reasonable as I can usually break even after 6-8 months. However, I know that new better models are being released each year, so what do you guys think are the future profits of S9s? 

In my situation, would you keep scaling with S9s or go for something more powerful/expensive, such as S17s?

P.S I can see the ""how do you get free electricity?"" question, so to answer it in advance, it's not entirely free since, as mentioned above, I pay a fixed rate.

My initial purchase in July of 2021 was supposed to be online within the month of purchase. Apparently the facility wasn't ready in time, so my miner got bumped. Over the next few months, I had offers to host in different facilities. I accepted every time, but I would hear nothing in response. I finally got to speak with a customer service rep, and he put me in touch with a tech who got the miner online within the week. The problem was finally resolved, but six months late.

Thinking the issues were finally behind us, I purchased a 'certified secondhand' miner from them. They accepted my $10k without issue. After four days of no status update, I reached out to Compass. Unfortunately someone else had already purchased this miner, and they must not have any system in place to handle this. It took another 3 day wait before I could get a meeting in order to authorize a return of my funds.

Shortly before I took the meeting, I was offered 2 new miners at a discount. I agreed to roll over funds to the new purchase, and my additional funds were accepted by Compass. I waited 24 hours after my funds being accepted, and I still hadn't received a confirmation email for my purchase.

I sent my customer service rep a text explaining the situation and voicing my displeasure over the terrible service I'd experienced. He never responded.

I reached out to the tech support team. Received an automated message that they'd reach out to me within 48 hours. It's been over a week and I'm still getting no response.

At this point I don't know what's happening with my $22,000 and I can't see a path forward that doesn't involve a legal dispute.

To be completely clear, I don't get the feeling that Compass Mining is a scam; they seem to be a legitimate company that's TERRIBLY managed.",17,bitcoinmining,2022-03-08 05:17:08
t9bvyf,onlinefunner,32,https://redd.it/t9bvyf,None,Why you cant making money mining: S19J Pro Miners (and all others) do not breakeven with proper math.,"I am using this calculator:   [Profitability Calculator | Braiins](https://insights.braiins.com/en/profitability-calculator/)(rounded some of the numbers too)

&#x200B;

Assume:

* Miner (S19J Pro 104th)  price from Bitmain: $10,000
* $0.07/kwh
* Consumption:  3068W
* Bitcoin price $: 40,000
* Difficulty: 27550332084343
* Pool fee:  2%
* \-------------

RESULT:   That's going to take *2+ years to just pay off the miner*.

....

# But wait, there's more: The hidden costs that most people dont include:

Add in:

* ***average difficulty increase***, which I set at 50% per year ( [Difficulty - BTC.com](https://btc.com/stats/diff))**.** *Is this accurate for last few years? Pretty varied swings, I know, but long run average.* This factor is the real profit killer in bitcoin mining.
* **Miner depreciation rate**:  -50% annually.   *Again, is that accurate?*

Now after 2 years, you are still not at breakeven! In fact, you now only have a combined $5,100 in profit (which includes the hardware value should you sell it then. Mining profit is only $3,000 due to difficulty increases).

....

# But wait, there's more!

Add a shipping container mining data center, and mining becomes very, very unprofitable.

# How can mining be so popular when my math shows mining doesnt make anything really?

I mean after 2 years, the daily miner profits are next to nothing, so its not like you will ever recoup your initial investment.

Sure miners can hold bitcoin, but just much easier to buy bitcoin if thats the only way you are making money. Even if you bump BTC to $45k price, still not much difference.

...

Some number adjustments:

Decrease difficulty to 40% and depreciation to 20%, and miner cost to $8k.  Wow, still not at breakeven after two years, and then making $1/day in the end, so not like it's ever going to pay off.

&#x200B;

My only conclusion is that large scale guys are buying miners for a LOT cheaper than Bitmain's list price, but even at half price, the IRR for two years is only 13%

(in fact, you have to pay an extra 25% on import duties if you buy from Bitmain).

&#x200B;

UPDATE:

The biggest lever is probably the price of Bitcoin (along with depreciation). Here are 3 yearly price scenarios for the IRR:

&#x200B;

|BTC price change|1 year IRR|
|:-|:-|
|\- 10%|\- 90%|
|0%|\- 33%|
|\+ 10%|\+ 26%|
|\+ 20%|\+ 83%|

&#x200B;

So, basically bitcoin mining is just a big leverage for BTC price, just like gold mining stocks.

&#x200B;

Also, selling hosting and ASICS seems like a good model because you are selling shovels and sluice boxes to the gold miners.

What I am really interested in is data that shows:  Depreciation rates and miner prices, relative to BTC prices for the last few years. ",4,bitcoinmining,2022-03-08 07:59:44

I am here to ask for help if anyone had the same problem and has any Unlock Firmware that they can provide me with. The unlock firmware is so my engineer can compare and do something about it with my miners, I already tried innosilicon technical support and they don't help me

&#x200B;

My purchase was legal, I can check my billing, the issue is that it was second-hand with a company in China (which I investigated and if it presents tax information) but innosilicon ""can't"" be held responsible because I didn't buy it with them.

&#x200B;

I have been holding my investment for months because they sold me locked miners and nobody is in charge, if someone could provide me with an unlocking firmware I would greatly appreciate it. My miners are model T2Thf+ and T2Thl+ thanks

We wanted to make a post after seeing an increase of advertisement on the subreddit. We‚Äôre happy that more people are getting into mining, and are communicating through here to find units. However, this community also has a lot of people just getting into mining/curious about ASICs.

If you are interested in buying, please make sure you vet those you talk to. If you find them through reddit, or similar social media channels, try to locate them off-site as well. A website/more formal channel that shows more about who they are and their company. Ask how their process works for selling, where the miners are coming from, their warranty, shipping cost and timing, and if you can pick up the units directly. It is also good to get on a video call with them to ask these questions and put a face to a name. Asking for more information is always a good thing, on the call if they can show you their ID, any miners they have currently available etc. 

If you‚Äôre buying from another redditor or individual, we wish you the best of luck. Please keep in mind that it is more risky. Do your research beforehand and know what you‚Äôre getting into.

We welcome you to comment any more tips you have to fellow miners.",13,bitcoinmining,2022-03-10 15:27:06

tb8ub7,MexicanGanjalord,6,https://redd.it/tb8ub7,None,power requirements.,"Ihave recently purchased an s9 . I have been running it for approximately a week and a half , I have noticed that the power bar I have it plugged Into keep tripping the surge protector . Sometimes it runs fine for a few days sometimes it needs to be reset twice a day. This caused me to do some research. 


What I have found is u need 220v power something no one explained before purchasing. Currently I have it plugged into a lone 110 circuit running at 1400w . Upon further research I also found that the power supply will only run 1200 w at 110v . 

After all the research I have concluded that this is fairly dangerous as it is overloading the power supply . Until I can Install a 220 circuit I am going to lower the power limit to within the specified margins . 

It's confusing because it runs fine on the 110 except from occasionally shutting down. I believe it is due to excess heat. I believe lowering the power limit should also alleviate this issue aswell. 

Something else to be aware of for beginners, the person that sold me the s9 sold it with a 18 gauge power cord which is dangerously undersized. While it was running I felt the cord and it was burning hot . I have since upgraded to a 14 gauge cord .",2,bitcoinmining,2022-03-10 21:06:48

tbb637,Nebulafactory,1,https://redd.it/tbb637,None,Question about 8 pin connectors,"I'm aware on what the maximum power draw should be for each 6/8 pin cable, but I have a very big doubt on being able to power an A9 with an 850W PSU

The A9 uses a maximum of 600W, so it should be no issue in paper.

Issue appears on the fact that the Asic requires 6 6-pin connectors and these PSU's only have 4 8/6 conectors.

I wouldnt be able to run a splitter from an 8 pin to cover 3 connectors because it would be right on the max power limit that connector can take.

However, this isnt a modular PSU, its integrated, so from the 2 pcie cables, it diverts into 2 8 pins each.

Would it be alright if I use a 8-pin to x2 6-pin connectors on each one?

Theoretically each 8-pin connector would only be taking 200w out of the 288w each one can take, so that wouldnt be an issue, but I'm worried wether the multi wire itself wouldnt be able to take the 400W from both 8 pins.

Let me know what is the best thing I could do for this, already got the Psu's and would not be worth it having to spend over 100‚Ç¨ in new ones when these are already new, and more than enough power to run an asic each.",2,bitcoinmining,2022-03-10 22:44:59

tc5wif,CyberhashMining,3,https://redd.it/tc5wif,None,Toronto Supplier of Bitcoin ASICs," 

Hello, I'm [Shafin Rizvi](https://linkedin.com/in/shafinr/) a recent graduate from George Brown College in Toronto. I and a few other BTC fanatics, graduates/friends, got together and founded Cyberhash Technologies INC last year. Cyberhash is a new Canadian supplier of BTC ASIC machines (but we also have some ASICs for other coins as well). Our company is small, as we are a recent start-up.

We have the latest miners from Whatsminer, Antminer, Avalon, and some other brands such as Innosilicon. All our miners are new, come with the manufacturer's warranty, and are unopened. However, we also carry used miners at times.

If you are located near Toronto, you can come to inspect, and even test run, our miners in person before you buy. We usually have a discount on prices compared to other suppliers. We can also ship our miners to you, or personally deliver if appropriate. Our shipping times can often be as short as several days to a few weeks, or max 3 weeks.

If you would like to know more about our company, Cyberhash, please visit [Cyberhash.io](https://cyberhash.io/).

As you can see in the footer of our website, we are a registered business in Vancouver, BC. This means that if God forbid, we tried to scam you, you could take legal action against us (provided you are in Canada). The address listed in our footer is our virtual office, meaning we don't physically use it, it's just for forwarding mail and so our business has a physical address for legal purposes.

Also if you have any questions, or would like to speak to me personally either comment below or email me at [shafin@cyberhash.io](mailto:shafin@cyberhash.io)

We are more than willing to sign a legal paper contract and/or make a recorded video call contract that identifies us using government-issued I.D so you feel safe making a purchase. That way you don't have to fear us scamming you, and you can focus on getting your machines.

I hope to do business with you soon.

tc5xyz,Tatufaiv,12,https://redd.it/tc5xyz,None,Help or tips for Asic miner beginner,"Hello everyone. I was planning to buy an Asic (or more than one, if it's convenient) that can generate me about 500-1000$ every month, preferred in BTC.

I saw that electricity cost is now a big problem, here in Italy i pay about 20 cents per Kw/h and it's outrageous.
But I can will to spend about 6000‚Ç¨ too, for solar panels that can generate me 5/6kw/h for a whole day.
Noise/temperature is not a problem.

So with that said, leaving apart the electricity cost problem, which sites/Asics are the best?

(I prefer BTC mining because Ethereum's merge is coming soon, and i am more confident since BTC is here to stay. Things could go bad for eth or mining could stop completely)

Thanks to everyone. Every bit of help is happily taken :)",1,bitcoinmining,2022-03-12 02:03:00

\- Restarting the unit a couple times always got everything hashing again... until now

thcvr2,wattumofficial,6,https://redd.it/thcvr2,None,Bitmain announces new liquid cooled 255 TH/s Antminer S19 XP Hydro," Bitmain has revealed its new liquid cooled S19 ASIC mining rig, the Antminer S19 XP Hydro. The company has only just recently announced the Antminer S19 Pro+ Hydro, its previous liquid cooled ASIC miner. This newest model will now achieve a whopping 255 TH/s hashrate, 28% more than the S19 Pro+ Hydro‚Äôs 198 TH/s, and 82% more than the base S19 XP model‚Äôs 140 TH/s.

The newest hydro cooled unit will also be Bitmain‚Äôs most efficient to date, with an efficiency rating of 20.8 J/TH and a power consumption of 5304W. In comparison, the S19 Pro+ Hydro is rated at 27.5 J/TH with a power consumption of 5445W, while the S19 XP sits at 21.5 J/TH and 3010W. These numbers also make the S19 XP Hydro more than twice as powerful as the base S19 Pro model.

Miners need as much computing power as they can get in order to maximize their mining profits, as earning Bitcoin will only get more difficult, so this announcement comes at the perfect time as the BTC mining difficulty has reached a new all-time high.

More powerful hardware in turn runs at higher temperatures, hence why Bitmain has once again gone with a liquid cooled solution in order to help keep S19 XP Hydro temperatures in check, preventing overheating and ensuring peak performance at all times.

The Bitmain Antminer S19 XP Hydro is expected to begin shipping Q1 2023; pre orders will open soon, so stay tuned and sign up for our newsletter to be the first to know about availability, installment payment options, and much more.

Pre orders for the S19 Pro+ Hydro are currently open, with shipping expected for July 2022. [Get in touch](https://cdn.wattummanagement.com/contact/) with a Wattum sales representative to order yours today.

I am looking for a company to help supply equipment to get an operation going.

If you are interested please feel free to email me and I will get back ASAP.

tiy6d8,floodcapital,4,https://redd.it/tiy6d8,None,Bitcoin Mining Strategy,"Hello Miners! 

I want to get the conversation started on what your Bitcoin mining strategy is and what's optimum in the long term (2+ years). 

My thoughts have been to keep your ASICs running all the time even if unprofitable and stack Sats. Speculate by selling some (not all) SATs in a bull market and hold the cash in GUSD or stable coin of choice. Then when the bear market comes (or you have enough cash) you buy the most efficient ASICs at best price you can. And keep all your machines running. While this is happening work on reducing your electricity bill by finding cheaper power and making your ASIC more efficient (air flow, temp, immersion, etc). 

Now from a business standpoint, you would have to add capital to keep the business running in the bear (unprofitable) market but would reap all the gains when the bull market hits. And of course I think Bitcoin is just going higher into the future. But I feel this is a start to a strategy. 

Also if you have GPUs then you should mine ETH and get paid in BTC (2 miners).

The question is should one hold their SATs or reinvest it into new ASICs?",2,bitcoinmining,2022-03-20 23:43:55

So I have been running an s9j (14.5TH) + apw7 1800w PSU on stock firmware for about 3 months with no real issues. Recently, I upgraded the firmware to braiins os+. With the auto tune, it began running at 16TH without any changes to power supply or anything else. (Just the default settings with braiins os). Then I noticed I could set the PSU limit. (Default was 1420w), so I decided to test 1500w psu limit. It works great, and I am now getting 17 - 17.4TH. Also, just so you're aware: I currently have a locked in power bill that costs the same amount no matter how much power I use... so efficiency doesn't matter so much to me, because whether I run it none, or at max power, I pay the same amount. My question is: is it reasonably safe to set the psu limit at 1800w? I would like to get the maximum possible TH out of my rig, but I want to make sure this won't burn out the hash boards or anything else... has anyone else pushed their s9 to 1800w? 1700w? 1600w?

tj8yab,Active-Indication-68,1,https://redd.it/tj8yab,None,Why is your miner supplier late in shipping to you?,"I saw a reddit post complaining that his L7 hadn't been shipped yet and he asked his supplier, who was honest enough to tell him that all the US dealers were sourcing all their miners from different Chinese suppliers and that the main problem was with these Chinese suppliers.

There are hundreds of miner dealers in China and most of them are not qualified to order directly from the miner manufacturers, they will purchase their miners from those large miner dealers and this causes problems, if your US dealer is ordering from smaller dealers in China there will be many problems.

The larger dealers will give priority to their own customers over the smaller dealers when they get the manufacturer's goods, which will result in many of the smaller dealers receiving their goods very late (not just in time, but at a much higher price), and if your US seller is sourcing the miners from a smaller dealer in China, you will receive them even later.

This time gap is even months, some people have not received his L7 yet and our L7s are already starting to drop in price.

My advice to the average customer is to always choose a US dealer you trust, even if they may be slow and expensive, as many Chinese dealers you have no way of telling if they are scammers or not.

With US dealers don't rely on price alone to tell if they are trustworthy or not, some prices seem low just because they have found a large Chinese supplier.",2,bitcoinmining,2022-03-21 10:47:22

We group miners together into a pool. Another group of miners is grouped creating a second pool, and so on. 

Virtually no miners are operating outside of a pool. We have competing pools now. 

What if we built into the Bitcoin protocol a global pool 
, a default pool that all miners are members of. 

The assumption is if you have hash-rate you are entitled to your share of block rewards + fees.

How would this change mining incentives? 

How would this change the business of mining?

tok11s,cgerst,4,https://redd.it/tok11s,None,S9 performance and poor payment?,"So full disclosure I‚Äôm not the most informed on all of this. I‚Äôve been following crypto since January of 2013, I got interested in mining about two years ago. I had an Antminer t17 but it flipped the breaker too many times in my rental so I went down to a s9 about a year and a half ago. My electricity is free so that‚Äôs why I wanted to adventure with these. However my s9 has gone from an average of 11TH to 6 in the last month on top of AntPool seeming to pay less per TH anyway. Is the hardware just worn out and I need to toss it or is there a way to get it back up to par? Would anyone recommend a different pool as well? Do I be an asshole and offload potentially burnt out hardware on some unsuspecting eBay buyer? I have a comfortable electronic repair skill set I can solder and rewire but is it worth putting time in to fix this thing, or is there firmware resets that could help? Again my electricity is free so maybe I should just let it lie and get what I can out of it but my payout is going from every three months to looking like 5 plus.",1,bitcoinmining,2022-03-26 08:19:09

tqemj4,wattumofficial,0,https://redd.it/tqemj4,None,Wattum Launches Effort to Support Ukrainian Families Trapped by War,"*In 1991, a 6 year old boy moved from Odessa, Ukraine to the United States with his family following the collapse of the Soviet Union. Having now lived in the United States for more than 30 years, Igor Soshkin, President of Wattum, recalls his parents and grandparents saying how fortunate they were to have settled in America, that their children and grandchildren would never have to face such instability as a result of political disintegration.*

In 2014, a new conflict erupted in the Donbass region of Ukraine, forcing many families to relocate from the East to the West. During this time, Igor Soshkin hired many great and talented individuals for his startup‚Äôs accelerator. The startup, Nice Capital, currently employs over 120 people in Ukraine, and much of this staff was transferred to Wattum in 2021 as the company grew. In the days leading up to the invasion of Ukraine by Russian military forces in February 2022, we had already set forth plans to enable safe relocation and financial support for all Ukrainian employees and their families.

Wattum‚Äôs C Levels are primarily located in the United States, the U.K., and other parts of the world outside of Ukraine. Our development and IT teams, who are essential to the success of our business, are mainly concentrated around Ukraine, Russia, and Belarus.

As a result of the ongoing conflict, our Ukrainian and Russian employees are under insurmountable pressure; while propaganda aims to point fingers against one side or the other, the truth is that both sides are suffering. Russians are being discriminated against despite being against the war, and are watching their economy collapse as the world chooses sides. Ukrainians are watching their cities burn, their houses being destroyed, and are being forced to leave all they know and love in exchange for cramped and over occupied hotel rooms, where their entire family awaits next steps that are not yet known.

Ukrainian Roots

We have visited Kyiv, Ukraine many times over the last 5 years for a number of team building gatherings. A city no different than that of New York, it is difficult to imagine that it could be attacked by missiles and heavy artillery in the 21st century.

It is difficult to imagine that parents and grandparents were once thanking God that the new generations of their family would never have to experience 1991 or leave their country in search of a better life, and yet their children now watch their country suffer 30 years later. While children in the United States play safely at home on their iPads, game consoles, and other toys and gadgets, their peers abroad don‚Äôt spend their days the same way. Knowing that there are parents running for their lives with their children in hand is a disheartening truth that is difficult to grasp.

Our Relocation and Security Efforts

Inside preparations for Wattum‚Äôs efforts to relocate staff and offer suitable support, we rented out several apartments in the western region of Ukraine in the days leading up to the initial invasion, not yet knowing what the outcome would be but preparing for a worst case scenario nonetheless. We asked our staff that stayed in these apartments to complete daily check-ins to ensure they were alright, and had begun confirming which team members were in which city. What their individual plans for relocation were.

To lessen their burden, we took it upon ourselves to monitor the situation through daily updates from the [ISW](https://www.understandingwar.org/) in order to better understand where military forces were actively moving to next. At first, the Russian military‚Äôs goal was to take Ukraine within mere days. However, when their strategy failed, they effectively switched to a strategy of destroying cities into submission. Once this strategy had been applied to Mariupol and Kharkiv, it became clear that everyone needed to move west before attempting to make their way back to their own cities.

It is not easy to convince an entire family to uproot their lives and move away from their home. We spent countless hours speaking to our team members, asking them to reason with their families and to get them to move. Many members of their families are elderly and have gone through war before, and would rather risk losing their lives in their home as opposed to starting all over again elsewhere. Their children, our team, are now forced to make the impossible decision of leaving them behind, not knowing the fate that awaits them, while themselves running into the unknown. Countless hours and multiple days; each conversation takes its emotional toll, and you are left feeling drained and helpless at the end of each day.

Borders are closed for men, and women refuse to leave without their husbands. With few opportunities for our employees to leave the country, moving simply defers the time before active conflict may reach them.

More than 3.6 Million Ukrainians Have Fled to Neighboring Countries

Today, our only hope is that the Russian government will exhaust its budget allocated for this war before reaching Ukraine‚Äôs westernmost region. We anticipate that the conflict will persist for between 30 and 90 more days as [Russian forces seek to recruit foreign soldiers](https://www.wsj.com/articles/russia-recruiting-syrians-for-urban-combat-in-ukraine-u-s-officials-say-11646606234), and will continue to do all that we can to ensure the safety of our team. We will continue to make every effort to relocate all families to the west and, as soon as borders open, will try to help everyone that wants to leave Ukraine into a NATO country.

Despite our hopes for conflict to subside, members of our team and the people of Ukraine face adversity and active hardship. More than 3.6 million refugees have fled the country to date, and a recent trip to Ukraine‚Äôs westernmost region lasted over 17 hours. People were required to stand or lay straight on the ground for the duration of the voyage in order to make room for others. Even [while attempting to flee, citizens are being attacked](https://news.sky.com/story/ukraine-russia-latest-news-families-running-for-their-lives-macrons-plea-to-putin-after-broken-ceasefire-russian-oil-could-be-banned-12541713?postid=3491799#liveblog-body) and their lives are at risk, while others are forced underground, praying and [singing](https://www.instagram.com/tv/CareTgGJM7Q/?utm_medium=copy_link) together in bunkers with remaining members of their community.

Our Ongoing Efforts and How You Can Help

We commend those who have never held a gun in their hands, yet chose to take up arms when they realized their home was in danger. When they realized that their families were at risk, they became committed to defending their home and stood to set up a second line of defense behind their country‚Äôs military.

Men and women of all ages have come together under the most tragic of circumstances and stand proudly against the invasion. Among them are Ukrainian celebrities, including lead singer of Ukrainian rock band *Boom Boks* Andriy Khlyvnyuk, [singing for the strength of his people](https://www.instagram.com/tv/CareTgGJM7Q/?utm_medium=copy_link) while outfitted in full military gear. Such bravery and patriotism helped stall the Russian army‚Äôs advance on Kyiv for more than 2 weeks as citizens hold tactical positions and aim to defend the country they know and love, through intimidation and resilience.

For these reasons and many others we cannot count, we thank our clients who have stood by us as we work to navigate the barriers that have been set forth by current events. As Wattum continues efforts to relocate our team and their families, we are also leading a donation initiative to help increase exposure of firsthand information from the site of the conflict, and to provide financial aid to those who need it most.

Uhmm.. if im being honest you get a sign up bonus by signing up on your own, you do not need to get referred in order to get this, most players will say it the other way in order to get referrals . The only benefit is towards myself for referring you.

I however can offer tonnes of indepth advice to starters about the economy, the market , the future of the game and tips to profit.

I started with a higher investment and managed to learn the market and profit more with that strategy.
I invested 500 usd. The price was slightly higher, buying all three packs cost about 180 usd, i bought a large pack for my wife , bringing the investment up to 250 and then deposited 25 each for resources. Investment up to 300. Then i invested 200 into assets as we approached the first profit window
That 200, grew to 350. Thats where im at.

This is a LONG term investment game , the next profit window will be in 8-12 weeks , you can still profit short term but the profits will be less.
This game is completely Pay to earn.

Future of the game includes: mini games to plant crops, if youre good at them you can work for others and do their crops for a profit back, pvp fishing mini game , also several more exchanges set to open through the upcoming month

Please DM me for more information, tips advice etc. 


Upland, real world based property trading game. 
Akin to Monopoly. Ontop of the property trading aspect , you can build ontop of your properties further increasing their value.
New players are given access to FSA properties , which is the Fair Start Act, this gives properties a dramatically reduced price compared to what other players get

This FSA lasts until you graduate from the third tier ($100 account value, invested or earned )
You may only sell 2 FSA properties per week

There are 6, maybe more ""tiers"" or account levels that differentiate you.

1. Visitor , essentially a trial or newbie account , you have full access to purchase , you can get players to visit your property (generally the one who referred you , and co) to help boost your wallet so you may purchase properties.
You cannot sell or trade properties as a visitor
You must renew your Upland Visa, every 7 days.
This account status lasts until you have an account value of 10,000 UPX or 10$ and have upgraded to Uplander 

2. Uplander 
Official account status, you may buy and sell fsa properties and other properties to earn capital. This is a property trading game, buy and sell to make money, choose your own roi by listing properties at your choice price.
Access to SPARK ;Given 0.01 spark if you level during spark week.
Access to tours, more treasure hunts, and full access to the games features.
This account status lasts until 99,999 upx at 100,000 upx you will be given the option to upgrade to Pro. 

3. Pro
Pro gives you access to exclusive avatars, and a status icon. And 0.1 spark This is the graduation from FSA properties as they are no longer available
This account status lasts from 100,000 upx to 1,000,000 UPX account value

4. Director
Gives you a custom avatar. And 0.5 Spark This status lasts until 10M UPX

5. Executive gives 1 spark for level up during spark week.
Leveling up during spark week , once a month, gives players spark for free , if you level to pro on spark week, and havent leveled on spark week yet, you will earn all spark for the lower tiers.

There are several ways to earn in this game , i will list them now , please ask for indepth.

1. Buy and sell (FSA for new players)
2. Rent , each property earns you UPX which you may get every 3 hours.
3. Collections : each city has upwards of 10 to 20 collections, each collection requires a certain number of properties in a certain area of upland
You are rewarded with a flat amount 600 UPX minimum up to 50k+ and a modifier to the rent earnings.
4. Spark you may purchase Spark , earn from leveling , and earn in randomized treasure hunts across the map, you may use your Spark , which is defined as WorkHours , to build ontop of your properties, you may also rent out your spark for upx

Spark costs 450 usd for 1.0

The game introduced ""legits"" which are NFL based Nfts. Im still learning.

I have a strategy for which i have not yet invested. Referral bonus started me with 4500 upx. I have grown that to 20k account value. 

The referal code gives you 4500 to start the game , i have used that to get to uplander. And a 50% new deposit bonus up to 50$ rewarded

tukls9,RytisDA,0,https://redd.it/tukls9,None,3080 GAMING Z TRIO LHR - unstable after flashing bios,"Hi, so I have this problem - I bought couple of GAMING Z TRIO and it happened to be that one card that somehow limits its power and won't mine at full potential. Basically it would cap at 200W which is way lower than what it should be capable of.

Anyhow, I found a ""solution"" - I flashed Asus BIOS to the card and now it can bypass the power cap, but there's another problem, I cannot seem to find OC settings that would keep it stable + my power consumption on HiveOS is way off what it really is (which is not really a huge problem, but it is still there).

So my question are:

* Is there a better way to work around the 200W power limit without flashing the BIOS (which would keep the card stable I assume)?
* If not, any of you have the same issue and have idea how to fix it?
* How bad for the card in the long run are random jumps in power/VRAM temps from like 220W all the way to 250W+ and around 80C to 90C+? It happens constantly, the card is never stable - basically every second it jumps to random numbers (I know that because I see the power jumping not just in Hive, but also on the physical meter I have for my power).

I am mining ETH + ERG btw, using T-Rex on HiveOS.

tur7gz,RelativeAny2687,2,https://redd.it/tur7gz,None,"Mining difficulty at all-time high, and this both excites and scares me","Just when the Bitcoin miners helped release the 19th millionth BTC in circulation on Friday, the BTC network‚Äôs mining difficulty reciprocated by reaching an all-time high of 28.587 trillion. 

Supporting the spike in the network difficulty, Bitcoin‚Äôs hash rate maintained a stronghold throughout the year while breaking into an all-time high of 248.11 EH/s on Feb. 13.

A higher hash rate ensures resilience against double-spending attacks, which is the process of reversing BTC transactions over the blockchain by contributing to at least 51% of the Bitcoin hash rate. 

Back on Mar. 4, roughly a month before reaching an all-time high, the BTC network difficulty experienced a slight decline from 27.96 trillion to 27.55 trillion, which eventually fell down to 27.45 trillion until Mar. 30. Prior to that, the resilient Bitcoin network grew consistently since July 2021.

This could mean a lot for the expansion of the world of crypto and application of e-commerce even within with the likes of Exeno bridging the gap, or even lead to the expansion of the Metaverse itself. Crypto is powerful, volatile and taking everything in its stride right now. Tread carefully.

With just 2 million BTC left to mine as rewards and an influx of Bitcoin miners from across the world, the BTC network is expected to increasingly grow stronger as it supports the thriving community. it is estimated that the remaining 2 million BTC (out of the total supply of 21 million) will be eventually mined roughly by the year 2140 owing to factors including halving.",39,bitcoinmining,2022-04-02 19:35:52

tv26kz,jjosh_h,3,https://redd.it/tv26kz,None,Assessing *my* carbon footprint from mining bitcoin.,"I'm sure there is plenty of pushback in this community that mining is bad for the environment. That's understandable. Afterall, \*we\* have a vested interest in wanting to believe this is a good thing. Now, I'm not here to tell you what you can't do, but I wanted to answer the question of what \*my\* environmental impact was mining bitcoin. So I did a bit of calculations to produce some informal estimates.  


I've got an RTX 3070 that I occasionally use to mine. I've had it since August 2021. I've made \~0.0097 during that time, mining at different levels. I recently set the preset to max the output, and I've made a consorted effort to do it mine more consistently to increase profits. In the last week, I've earned \~0.0000578 bitcoin / 24hr. The wattage changes, but it seems to stay at around 125 W. I know these numbers fluctuate, but the goal here is to get a rough estimate. That said, that equates to \~7 days of constant usage, or a total of 503 kWh. I pulled (I think from the EPA) estimates for the carbon footprint of different electric energy sources. It was 1.02 kgCO2 for Coal and 0.41 kg CO2. That puts my footprint between 208 kgCO2 or 513 kgCO2 (I'm not sure my electricity is from coal or natural gas).

To put that in perspective, I compared that to the carbon footprint that comes from our food production. Specifically I compared it to Meat eaters, Vegetarian, and Vegans. The main reason is that I'm vegan, and I always considered the environment a big reason to go Vegan. I wanted to be conservative with my estimates, so I assumed I got my energy exclusively from coal. ***The result is that my net carbon foot print is \~equal with meat eaters.***

In some ways, you could say, my bitcoin mining is fine because I make up for it by not eating meat. That logic is flimsy but okay lets just accept it as reasonable. The fact is, I've bumped up my usage of late. I've reduced my game play to maximize profits, so my impact moving forward is going to be larger. So, I took it a step further and asked what my carbon footprint would be if I just mined all day every day. 

*Even with the liberal estimate assuming my energy is from natural gas, my yearly carbon footprint is* ***5 times higher*** *than the average meat eater footprint per year. If it's coal, that number goes to over* ***10 times****.* 

&#x200B;

The take away, I can't mine and pretend it isn't an objectively harmful thing to do, at least *by my existing standards*. I am not here to judge you or tell you what to do, but if I continue to mine, I'm either a hypocrite or just someone who is willing to do (what I consider) bad things to make cash. You might think I'm saying I'm stopping mining, but I'm mining as I type this. I know this, but I haven't stopped. Will I? I honestly don't know. What I think matters, though, is that I am aware of the impact I have with the choices I make, however uncomfortable.

In the end, I'm not here to judge you or to tell you what is right or wrong about this. I suspect my 3070  set up is pretty weak compared to others. Whether you're comfortable with your impact is a decision you have to make, but what really matters is that you are *aware* of that impact. It may not be comfortable, but it's necessary.

&#x200B;

\-----

Anyways, I wanted to share this because I don't know what to do with it, and I figured this community is the most likely to criticize my logic and (loose) methodology. I'm interested in what y'all might have to say on the subject on environmental impact.",3,bitcoinmining,2022-04-03 05:47:32

tv7zbb,Ok-Location9341,0,https://redd.it/tv7zbb,None,Bitcoin Miner PrimeBlock Plans to Go Public With $1.25B SPAC Merger,"The deal is expected to close in the second half of this year.

Bitcoin miner PrimeBlock confirmed its plan to go public through a merger with 10X Capital Venture Acquisition Corp. II (VCXA), a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC), for an estimated enterprise value of $1.25 billion.

Last year, the value of the deal was said to be around $1.5 billion, according to a Bloomberg report. The SPAC was seeking to raise at least $150 million through private investment in public equity (PIPE) for the deal, the report added.

PrimeBlock has secured a $300 million committed equity financing facility from CF Principal Investments LLC, an affiliate of Cantor Fitzgerald, the company said in a statement on Friday.

PrimeBlock generated $24.4 million in revenue for the fourth quarter of 2021 and has over 110 megawatts of installed data center capacity across its 12 facilities in North America.

Former Goldman Sachs investment banking veteran Gaurav Budhrani will be CEO of the combined company. Since coinbase went public, other companies have started nursing the intention to do this. I won't be surprised if Crypto exchange, Binance or even crypto back platform, Social Good does the same. 

The miner said it currently sources about 60% of its power from non-carbon emitting sources and plans to offset the remainder. The power source is just above the 58.5% sustainable energy mix that miners globally are now utilizing, according to the Bitcoin Mining Council‚Äôs estimate.",52,bitcoinmining,2022-04-03 12:17:47

If you have knowledge of this, please help me get started.   


# Questions:

1) What type of fluid do I need as coolant? I know [engineeringfluids.com](https://engineeringfluids.com) offers coolant that seems specifically designed for mining, but could I use other dielectric fluids? What about car coolant such as antifreeze (as long as its dialectic)? This specific [Grainger Dielectric Oil](https://www.grainger.ca/en/product/OIL-DIELECTRIC-5-GALLON/p/WWG1C191) is available close to me would it work?  


2) Besides building a box, filling it with fluid and placing the miner inside, what else do you need to do? Are there any requirements I need to consider when building the box?  


3) Does the coolant fluid just sit in the box absorbing heat, or does it need to be pumped? How does the cooling actually work?  


If you could give as much information as possible in multiple comments, I'll upvote all of them ;)

Some projects have already begun coding what I'm talking about, such as Blockstream.

txsnfo,Quiet_Line_3762,3,https://redd.it/txsnfo,None,Abkhazia Extends Bitcoin Mining Ban Till End of Year,"Authorities in Abkhazia have decided to maintain a ban on cryptocurrency mining in the territory. The partially recognized republic in the South Caucasus is restricting the energy-intensive extraction of digital currencies, citing problems with power supply.
The government of Abkhazia, a breakaway republic in Georgia, has prolonged current restrictions on the minting of cryptocurrencies until the end of 2022. On April 1, the cabinet in Sukhumi adopted the respective amendments to its decree from December 2020, which banned the use of electricity for mining and halted imports of relevant equipment.

The de-facto state has been struggling with power shortages and held talks with the Russian Federation, its main supporter, to ensure additional energy supplies. Frequent breakdowns of its electrical infrastructure have also been blamed on crypto miners. The persistent problems have postponed a plan to legalize and regulate the industry.

Abkhazia began to curb crypto mining activities back in 2018. Last April, the ‚Äútemporary ban‚Äù was extended for another year. In October, the republic‚Äôs telecom and media watchdog said its restrictions on internet access for miners will also remain in place for the time being.
If you live in this region,it is advisable to try bitcoin activities like getting crypto back from Social Good, Bitpay and co. Or try crypto that allows staking. It is sad that regions are banning bitcoin mining. 

Authorities in the republic have been going after crypto miners and announced the seizure of 6,000 units of mining hardware in September. 

At the same time, Abkhaz officials acknowledged that an estimated 30,000 mining rigs remained in operation, thus admitting a failure to prevent the population from minting digital currencies, which has become an alternative income source for many.

In its efforts to deal with the deepening energy crisis, the government introduced fines and even criminalized the illegal use of electrical power for crypto mining. A number of underground mining operations were shut down in June.",18,bitcoinmining,2022-04-06 18:22:55

u0bqkz,stakreo,5,https://redd.it/u0bqkz,None,Thinking to start a mining rig project!,"Hi miners!

I‚Äôm trying to get some feedback  to see if I can improve anything on the current mining cases that we can find out there, so below you will find a little bit of context on my experience

Last year I got into the mining space, got couple of rigs and installed them at home using a asus btc250 and a mining rig frame for 6 gpus. Awesome experience and learning curve indeed but to install everything with risers was a darn nightmare!

Besides the raisers and the cable mess I come across another problem, the rig was taking a lot of space (and looking very messy!) and to stack or store them became complex. At the same time the worst problem was the high temperature. Because of that some of the GPUs were throttling because the airflow was not so good (specially the ones in the meddle of the rig between all the other GPUs). After finding out the throttling issue, I had to crank the fans all the way up and even tho all of them were at 100% that was not enough. 

So finally I decided to buy a case (mining rig box), so I could have better airflow and improve the way to store the  rigs. 
After doing some research this process I came across the octominer and then all the cheaper alternatives out there. Octominer was very high priced indeed, but the most appealing one. Luckily for me, I managed to get a mining box including 8 fans for o a half of what the Octominer  was pricing itself (it included the mobo a B75 including cpu, ram and ssd). So far I am very happy with the purchase and I‚Äôm thinking that I may be able to bring them to EU, but I‚Äôm trying to figure out if there are any other things to improve beside the price.

So I would like to ask you guys if any of you have mining rig cases or ocotminers, is there something you will improve about the product? 

Any comments or suggestions are more than appreciated!",2,bitcoinmining,2022-04-10 06:24:53

Im posting for the very first  time because im looking for guidance and help from the community who in Bitcoin mining.  My journey start almost 2 years ago and quiclky became passion over this amazing moneraty revolution of what is Bitcoin and how does the network work. 

That how ive jump in mining almost 5 month ago now with Antminer S19 pro and the S19Apro.  At first i was runing them normally with air cooling but i rapidly found that immersion would be much more efficient in the summer where i live.  I have bought from the compagny DCX Immersion but their after sale services, i must say, is far from good.  

My system is the 3 box enclosure with a rack and a Drycooler (3fans) that supposedly is able to cool 120kw (40kw per box - 8 servers per box).  The drycooler is place outside, 1 feet from my building and just about 8 feet from the circulating pump.  My ratio of liquid inside the drycooler is about 60 glycol and 40 water.  In the winter below zero degree celsius the drycooler was able to cool the box efficiently.  But now spring is here and as soon the temperature is above 10 degree celsius (seem cold enought for me) the system doesn't cool down the rack and some of my server pass the threshold and stop mining. At 10 degree celsius outside, the inlet (cold liquid) is about 20-24 degree and the outlet 10 degree above. I have applied the best themal paste to some of the miner that look to miss some because of the dielectric liquid that dissolve  it and at best ive gain couple degree celsius on the miner.  I changed the speed of the circulating pump to see if it would keep the coolant longer in the drycooler to cool it down but no effect.  At this point im wondering what i can do because their system doesn't seem able to cool 24 server as mention on their website.  In the summer temperature can rise well above 25 degree without humidity.  

&#x200B;

Here the question im asking myself.

Is the liquid ratio is good  ?

Would is be better if the drycooler would be further away from the building ?

Is there some of my server that are defect ? 

&#x200B;

Any help will be appreciated.  Here pictures of the system :)

If these specs are true, then according to this calculator I could be able to turn over a dcent eprofit, nothing to live off obviously but still worth it for the long term.

So I have two questions:  
1) Am I using the calculator correctly? Because it seems almost too good to be true.  
2) Apollo BTC is currently sold out. Can anyone recommend a home miner with similar specs? Low sounds and low energy consumption are probably the most important.",5,bitcoinmining,2022-04-12 19:54:39

(S19 and L3+)","Doing some research on the best way to quiet down a small operation ( a single S19 and two L3's).  If I'm understanding correctly, the majority of the noise 'comes from' the exhaust (outlet) of the fans.  In other words, if I were to enclose the actual miner in a sound-reducing box, this would be less effective than leaving the miner in the open and routing the exhaust into a sound-reducing box. 

I was thinking about building something similar to what is often seen -- an MDF box lined with sound-absorbing foam, with multiple 'input' ducts and a single larger output ducts. Each miner would be connected via flex duct to the box.  I would use one of those black plastic adaptors to attach the fan to a 4""--->6"" adaptor, then use 6"" flex duct to the box. Also considering putting a single 'in-line-booster' onto the larger output duct to help ""pull"" air through the whole system.

I haven't come up with the exact setup yet, but I am also hoping to build it so that I can route the exhaust of the box either directly outdoors (through the wall) in the summer, or, during cooler seasons, vent the box back into a garage to warm it up.  In a perfect world I'd use some kind of damper so that I could potentially even split the airflow during the shoulder seasons (i.e. 25% of the air goes into the garage, 75% goes outside) to give more precise control over the heating of the interior space.

Think I am on the right track?",1,bitcoinmining,2022-04-13 13:37:39

This gave me pause, since the price is more expensive, which brings me to my main question:

Since I'll be immersion-cooling as well as using custom firmware, does it matter which unit I get (s19 vs S19j pro), or should I just go for best price that I can find within the X19 series?

Do different models have large discrepancies amongst them when going to IC + custom FW route?

u3l1sz,RedEagle_MGN,2,https://redd.it/u3l1sz,None,Does the Bitcoin community believe there any legitimate use for NFTs?,"*Samuel Martin:*

It's no secret that I've been driven by a deep and furious passion concerning the deluge of fraud that has taken over the virtual world industry:

[It‚Äôs heartbreaking to see crypto/NFTs destroy something I love](https://www.reddit.com/r/MetaverseOpen/comments/smb6ab/its_heartbreaking_to_see_cryptonfts_destroy/)

I started as a curious observer and I assumed, because of all of the big companies investing in the space, that there was real value.

The more I discovered, the more I was disturbed by what I saw. The more I looked into the [technical side](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1BiOcClgDVNESaPA3L7bYw?si=2f42603c53854d12), the less value I perceived. Time and time again I observed people were willing to turn a blind eye to obvious issues in order to generate a sense of hype.

Everyone was willing to believe someone else had figured it out but the closer I came to the emperor's chamber the more I realized that he was [wearing no clothes](https://www.bookbrowse.com/expressions/detail/index.cfm/expression_number/605/the-emperor-has-no-clothes).

A little compromise here, a little blindness there and the great deception is formed.

Where are the people of integrity?

If you don't know what I'm talking about I suggest reading:

[The idea that NFTs will allow you to take items between worlds is a pipe dream driven by ignorance. ](https://www.reddit.com/r/metaverse/comments/tz6520/the_idea_that_nfts_will_allow_you_to_take_items/)

Not only that I have noticed that artificial intelligence is being used here on Reddit to write articles in mass to promote the value of NFTs and crypto. It's the same article over and over and over again with synonyms changed. Then these posts are upvoted by bots creating a fake-news cycle supposedly supported by the masses.

However, the [more research I do](https://www.reddit.com/r/metaversestartup/comments/tjc6fk/as_a_gamer_i_would_be_less_inclined_to_play_games/) the less human support I see for this hype cycle.

Are we all just being led along by bots?

# Finally, my question:

I really believe in being objective about things and not just taking a position and being unwilling to change your mind. So I have been talking with industry experts trying to probe and find a way to challenge my own idea of the metaverse.There's one thing that I've been unable to refute concerning a possible value for NFTs, and I came here to see what people think:

In the past it's been very difficult to track the royalties of art sales. Let's say I create a piece of fine art and I want to give it up in exchange for royalties on its sale to a publisher. I want a transparent way to track this art throughout the web and get my royalties.

u3ou3c,wattumofficial,0,https://redd.it/u3ou3c,None,Wattum Launches a GoFundMe Relief Effort to Support Ukrainian Families Trapped by War," *In 1991, a 6 year old boy moved from Odessa, Ukraine to the United States with his family following the collapse of the Soviet Union. Having now lived in the United States for more than 30 years, Igor Soshkin, President of Wattum, recalls his parents and grandparents saying how fortunate they were to have settled in America, that their children and grandchildren would never have to face such instability as a result of political disintegration.*

In 2014, a new conflict erupted in the Donbass region of Ukraine, forcing many families to relocate from the East to the West. During this time, Igor Soshkin hired many great and talented individuals for his startup‚Äôs accelerator. The startup, Nice Capital, currently employs over 120 people in Ukraine, and much of this staff was transferred to Wattum in 2021 as the company grew. In the days leading up to the invasion of Ukraine by Russian military forces in February 2022, we had already set forth plans to enable safe relocation and financial support for all Ukrainian employees and their families.

Wattum‚Äôs C Levels are primarily located in the United States, the U.K., and other parts of the world outside of Ukraine. Our development and IT teams, who are essential to the success of our business, are mainly concentrated around Ukraine, Russia, and Belarus.

As a result of the ongoing conflict, our Ukrainian and Russian employees are under insurmountable pressure; while propaganda aims to point fingers against one side or the other, the truth is that both sides are suffering. Russians are being discriminated against despite being against the war, and are watching their economy collapse as the world chooses sides. Ukrainians are watching their cities burn, their houses being destroyed, and are being forced to leave all they know and love in exchange for cramped and over occupied hotel rooms, where their entire family awaits next steps that are not yet known.

## Ukrainian Roots

We have visited Kyiv, Ukraine many times over the last 5 years for a number of team building gatherings. A city no different than that of New York, it is difficult to imagine that it could be attacked by missiles and heavy artillery in the 21st century.

It is difficult to imagine that parents and grandparents were once thanking God that the new generations of their family would never have to experience 1991 or leave their country in search of a better life, and yet their children now watch their country suffer 30 years later. While children in the United States play safely at home on their iPads, game consoles, and other toys and gadgets, their peers abroad don‚Äôt spend their days the same way. Knowing that there are parents running for their lives with their children in hand is a disheartening truth that is difficult to grasp.

## Our Relocation and Security Efforts

Inside preparations for Wattum‚Äôs efforts to relocate staff and offer suitable support, we rented out several apartments in the western region of Ukraine in the days leading up to the initial invasion, not yet knowing what the outcome would be but preparing for a worst case scenario nonetheless. We asked our staff that stayed in these apartments to complete daily check-ins to ensure they were alright, and had begun confirming which team members were in which city. What their individual plans for relocation were.

To lessen their burden, we took it upon ourselves to monitor the situation through daily updates from the [ISW](https://www.understandingwar.org/) in order to better understand where military forces were actively moving to next. At first, the Russian military‚Äôs goal was to take Ukraine within mere days. However, when their strategy failed, they effectively switched to a strategy of destroying cities into submission. Once this strategy had been applied to Mariupol and Kharkiv, it became clear that everyone needed to move west before attempting to make their way back to their own cities.

It is not easy to convince an entire family to uproot their lives and move away from their home. We spent countless hours speaking to our team members, asking them to reason with their families and to get them to move. Many members of their families are elderly and have gone through war before, and would rather risk losing their lives in their home as opposed to starting all over again elsewhere. Their children, our team, are now forced to make the impossible decision of leaving them behind, not knowing the fate that awaits them, while themselves running into the unknown. Countless hours and multiple days; each conversation takes its emotional toll, and you are left feeling drained and helpless at the end of each day.

Borders are closed for men, and women refuse to leave without their husbands. With few opportunities for our employees to leave the country, moving simply defers the time before active conflict may reach them.

## More than 3.6 Million Ukrainians Have Fled to Neighboring Countries

Today, our only hope is that the Russian government will exhaust its budget allocated for this war before reaching Ukraine‚Äôs westernmost region. We anticipate that the conflict will persist for between 30 and 90 more days as [Russian forces seek to recruit foreign soldiers](https://www.wsj.com/articles/russia-recruiting-syrians-for-urban-combat-in-ukraine-u-s-officials-say-11646606234), and will continue to do all that we can to ensure the safety of our team. We will continue to make every effort to relocate all families to the west and, as soon as borders open, will try to help everyone that wants to leave Ukraine into a NATO country.

Despite our hopes for conflict to subside, members of our team and the people of Ukraine face adversity and active hardship. More than 3.6 million refugees have fled the country to date, and a recent trip to Ukraine‚Äôs westernmost region lasted over 17 hours. People were required to stand or lay straight on the ground for the duration of the voyage in order to make room for others. Even [while attempting to flee, citizens are being attacked](https://news.sky.com/story/ukraine-russia-latest-news-families-running-for-their-lives-macrons-plea-to-putin-after-broken-ceasefire-russian-oil-could-be-banned-12541713?postid=3491799#liveblog-body) and their lives are at risk, while others are forced underground, praying and [singing](https://www.instagram.com/tv/CareTgGJM7Q/?utm_medium=copy_link) together in bunkers with remaining members of their community.

## Our Ongoing Efforts and How You Can Help

We commend those who have never held a gun in their hands, yet chose to take up arms when they realized their home was in danger. When they realized that their families were at risk, they became committed to defending their home and stood to set up a second line of defense behind their country‚Äôs military.

Men and women of all ages have come together under the most tragic of circumstances and stand proudly against the invasion. Among them are Ukrainian celebrities, including lead singer of Ukrainian rock band *Boom Boks* Andriy Khlyvnyuk, [singing for the strength of his people](https://www.instagram.com/tv/CareTgGJM7Q/?utm_medium=copy_link) while outfitted in full military gear. Such bravery and patriotism helped stall the Russian army‚Äôs advance on Kyiv for more than 2 weeks as citizens hold tactical positions and aim to defend the country they know and love, through intimidation and resilience.

For these reasons and many others we cannot count, we thank our clients who have stood by us as we work to navigate the barriers that have been set forth by current events. As Wattum continues efforts to relocate our team and their families, we are also leading a donation initiative to help increase exposure of firsthand information from the site of the conflict, and to provide financial aid to those who need it most.

You can join our efforts by visiting [Humanitarian Aid For Wattum‚Äôs Ukraine Team](https://www.gofundme.com/f/humanitarian-aid-wattumHOFs-Ukranian--team?utm_campaign=p_cp+share-sheet&utm_medium=copy_link_all&utm_source=customer) and reading testimonials of the invasion recorded by our team living in Ukraine, and journal entries recorded by a Canadian couple via email correspondence. The couple had been visiting their family in Ukraine and were able to document their experience during the first 5 days of the conflict, which set the tone for the following weeks of struggle and destruction. For those who wish to donate to our efforts via crypto, please email [donation@wattum.io](mailto:donation@wattum.io) with your desired donation amount, and we will send you an invoice containing the crypto wallet address. We greatly appreciate all donations and kind thoughts, and encourage you to share the donation page and journal entries with your friends and colleagues.

Information, visibility, and compassion are our most valuable currencies, and together we can do what we can to support those affected by war.

Sincerely,

Igor Soshkin

I'm either going to use a 'carpet blower' or an 'in-line duct fan' to provide the power.  If I use the carpet blower, I think it'd be much easier to provide blowing/positive pressure, because the output of the fan seems to be much easier to attach/adapt to 8"" flex ducting (from what I understand you can basically just 'stretch' the ducting around the blower exhaust and clamp/tape/zip-tie it on there).  If I use an inline fan, I believe it'll be easy enough to do either.",2,bitcoinmining,2022-04-15 16:17:10
u4bwja,doughpat,3,https://redd.it/u4bwja,None,Carpet blower vs. inline fan,"Considering either a 'carpet blower' of appropriate CFM such as [this](https://www.homedepot.com/p/B-Air-1-4-HP-Air-Mover-Blower-Fan-for-Water-Damage-Restoration-Carpet-Dryer-Floor-Home-and-Plumbing-Use-in-Blue-BA-VP-25-BL/207012958), or an [inline fan](https://www.acinfinity.com/hvac-home-ventilation/inline-duct-fan-systems/cloudline-s8-quiet-inline-duct-fan-system-with-speed-controller-8-inch/).  Any strong reasons to do one over the other?

I'm guessing a decent quality in-line duct fan may be quieter, as the carpet fans are probably built for more 'robust' use and therefore will be heavier/louder.  They probably aren't really intended for continuous 24/7 use, either.  One other advantage is that since the output is round and intended to be hooked up to ducting, the 'adaptation' to ducting will be a lot cleaner/easier.  Lastly - I wasn't able to find the amp-draw of the Cloudline inline fan, but I have a feeling its going to be much more efficient. 

Curious if anyone has any other thoughts.",1,bitcoinmining,2022-04-15 16:30:19

The miners are placed to exhaust vertically, as the box is built as a chemine.

u5i5f9,Roselyn_nv,4,https://redd.it/u5i5f9,None,Bitcoin Miners in Kazakhstan To Pay Taxes Correlated to BTC Price,"
Kazakhstan, which was once regarded a desirable destination for Chinese miners of Bitcoin, a legal tender to many states and the fuel of numerous projects including the point network, following the country's ban on any BTC mining activity, now appears to be on the verge of enacting new levies that will have a detrimental influence on the business. 

In a government conference on April 14, Minister of National Economy Alibek Kuantyrov claimed that his team is working on a tax proposal that would link tax payments to the value of mined coins.

According to Kuantyrov's comments, which was initially reported by ForkLog, this will aid the country's tax collecting efforts by improving the state budget. However, this move may lead many miners to look into other countries, such as El Salvador, where the mining fee will be a flat 10% to help fund Bitcoin City's construction and services.

""We're thinking about raising the tax burden on miners, and we're also thinking about tying the tax rate for miners to the value of the cryptocurrency right now."" It will be beneficial to the budget if the cryptocurrency increases.""",13,bitcoinmining,2022-04-17 07:45:03

The mining industry took up about half of the production's display area. There were numerous passionate debates on the topic with filled audiences. Newer mining equipment was presented for the whole week. Huge queues of attendees were visible at the stands of mining facilities providers. Some major mining corporations claim to have their staff sniffing about for bargains.   Furthermore, Wall Street investing businesses and financial firms like B. Riley, HC Wainwright, including BNY Mellon (BK) sponsored conferences for miners. Also, the week's mining gatherings were even packed with participants.  
 The gathering ranged from groups to venture investors. Advanced Blockchains' application for an extraction Initial Public Offering or IPO and Core Scientific's $75.1 million debt agreement was among the agreements revealed throughout the week.   Gibbs had to halt discussion many times to address conference attendees at Compass Mining's exhibit. For him, it was a common scenario across many mining-related firm exhibits this year.   
The three leading mining equipment manufacturers, at least four immerse cooling suppliers, three to four power services providers selling their sustainable alternatives, and three miners servicing retail customers were among them. On the show floor, there were numerous additional new mining gear manufacturers.   Furthermore, several lesser-known hardware vendors were present at the conference.   
It indicates that new competitors may be attempting to enter the highly competitive. However, extremely profitable mining equipment manufacturing market. ""There's more of a participation from different suppliers on the hardware part than I've ever seen at an event before,"" Gibbs said. On the other hand, Gibbs expressed his ""slight apprehension"" about the newcomers. ""I believe we have some individuals here who are pushing things that have not been actually validated, which might put those who are keen to buy them at danger,"" Gibbs said.

But the truth is far more comforting than a handful of seemingly harsh data points about Bitcoin and the environment. I wanted to create this post to equip every miner and Bitcoiner with the arguments they need to spread the truth about Bitcoin‚Äôs impact on the environment.

How could such an energy-consuming technology benefit the Green Movement?

In short, there‚Äôs more to Bitcoin than its critics appreciate.

**Bitcoin mining renders renewable energy sources viable.** 

In April 2021, Jack Dorsey‚Äôs Square released a white paper boldly titled, ‚ÄúBitcoin is Key to an Abundant, Clean Energy Future‚Äù. Early in the memo, the authors explained that the costs for solar and wind energy have recently dropped by 90% and 71%, respectively. Suffice to say that green alternatives are rapidly gaining steam on the cost side of the ledger.

But as explained above, it‚Äôs difficult to match supply of solar and wind energy to demand. Demand for energy peaks in the early evening, when people are home and using appliances. At that time, though, the sun is already setting, and wind is always unpredictable.

**Enter Bitcoin mining**

Miners can work from anywhere, so long as they‚Äôre connected to a power source and the internet. Because of this, they can act as ‚Äòan energy buyer of last resort‚Äô: whenever supply of wind or solar exceeds demand, miners can jump in and pay for the privilege of using the energy to mine Bitcoin. This will render renewable energy far more profitable, and will therefore incentivize the creation of *more* green energy sources.

Square‚Äôs white paper puts it succinctly: ‚ÄúBitcoin miners‚Ä¶offer highly flexible and easily interruptible load‚Ä¶and are completely location agnostic, requiring only an internet connection. \[They are\] an energy buyer of last resort that can be turned on or off at a moment‚Äôs notice anywhere in the world.‚Äù

**Bitcoin is one of the cleanest industries on the planet**

In 2021, the Bitcoin Mining Council (BMC) published the results of a voluntary survey that investigated the electricity consumption and sustainable power mix of about one-third of the Bitcoin network. They discovered that those surveyed used electricity fed by 67% sustainable power. The surveyors inferred that the entire Bitcoin network‚Äôs sustainable electricity mix had increased to 56%, making it among the greenest industries in the world.

In contrast, electricity in the United States is only 30.5% sustainable, and electricity in China is less than 15% sustainable. 

**Bitcoin mining employs energy that would‚Äôve otherwise gone to waste**

As Caitlin Long, CEO of Avanti Financial Group, said in a recent documentary, ‚ÄúMore than 2/3 of the energy produced in the world is waste energy, because it‚Äôs produced during the hours of the day when there‚Äôs not demand to consume it‚Ä¶it‚Äôs also produced in a place where there‚Äôs not transmission to move it across space and time, and so that energy goes unused and wasted.‚Äù 

Crusoe Energy and others are tackling this issue with bitcoin Mining. The company raised 128 million dollars in 2021 to build data centers and Bitcoin mining operations that use this wasted energy and reduce methane emissions.

Crusoe Energy operates out of North Dakota, where 500 million cubic feet of gas are flared daily. The company runs forty data centers that harness flared natural gas as of 2021. Soon, they expect to operate 100 units across six states.  

Co-founder of Crusoe Energy, Lochmiller, said that ‚ÄúWhere we view our power consumption, we draw a very clear line in our project evaluation stage where we‚Äôre reducing emissions for‚Ä¶oil and gas projects.‚Äù

**Energy consumption drives progress and so doesn‚Äôt require defending**

Professor Vaclav Smil‚Äôs *Energy and Civilization: A History* traces the relationship between energy consumption and human progress. To take one example, he explains that a typical 1900 Great Plains farmer employed at most 5 kilowatts of power to plow his field using horses. In 2000, a farmer couple can employ over 250 kilowatts of power with a diesel engine, all while ‚Äúsitting high above the ground in the air-conditioned comfort of his tractor cabin.‚Äù

Smil‚Äôs thesis aligns with our common sense. There is a reason that modern cities consume more energy than ancient villages, that airplanes consume more energy than horses, and that calculators consume more energy than abacuses. Seen in this light, even *if* Bitcoin was the most energy-intensive money ever invented, that does not mean that we should continue using gold and fiat currencies. A more comprehensive comparison should compare all of the costs *and* benefits conferred on humanity by each money. 

To critics of Bitcoin who appeal to its energy consumption, I ask: why is environmental impact the standard by which you judge an innovation, rather than the benefit said innovation would confer on humanity? 

If you are interested in ways of pushing this movement and have more questions regarding changing the current paradigm around Bitcoin mining and the environment, Sazmining, a renewable energy Bitcoin mining venture, is hosting an [AMA](https://investor.sazmining.com/ama-sign-up-page/) today at 1 pm ET.

*RE: Notification of Termination of Hosting Agreement; SDN Designation*

Dear Compass Customer:

As part of its enforcement efforts, Office of Foreign Assets Control (‚ÄúOFAC‚Äù) publishes a list of sanctioned individuals and companies owned or controlled by, or acting for or on behalf of, targeted countries. ¬†¬†Such individuals and companies are called ‚ÄúSpecially Designated Nationals‚Äù or ‚ÄúSDNs‚Äù Once listed on the SDN List, parties subject to U.S. jurisdiction are generally prohibited from engaging in business transactions with the targeted party anywhere in the world. ¬†In addition, U.S. persons are required to block the assets of the targeted party that come within the U.S. person‚Äôs possession and not deal in them.

Compass Mining, Inc.‚Äôs (‚ÄúCompass‚Äù) hosting facility partner in Russia, BitRiver AG and its Russian based subsidiaries (‚ÄúBitRiver‚Äù), were added to the SDN list yesterday. ¬†In response to the unforeseen SDN listing, effective immediately, Compass has terminated its contractual relationship and business dealings with BitRiver.

Pursuant to the terms of the Compass Hosting Service Agreement (the ‚ÄúHosting Agreement‚Äù) you entered into, Compass is hereby notifying you that your Hosting Agreement has been terminated as a result of the BitRiver SDN designation and resulting termination of Compass‚Äô contractual relationship with BitRiver. ¬†The terms of the Hosting Agreement reflect that there will be no liability for any damage, loss, expense or costs as a result of such termination.

In an effort to assist its customers with a potential liquidation and resolution of this unprecedented and unforeseen situation, Compass is in the process of working to negotiate a refund and/or sale of all customer hardware that was located in the Russian hosting facility. ¬†Please note, this refund and/or sale transaction is in no way connected to any continued business relationship or further business transactions with BitRiver whatsoever; it would be undertaken with an independent non-sanctioned third-party outside of Russia. Compass is seeking your approval to include your hardware in the negotiated transaction. Granting approval will appoint Compass as your limited attorney-in-fact to execute, sign, and deliver any instruments or documents which may be required to effectuate and consummate the negotiated transaction consistent with this notification letter.

This transaction is still being negotiated and is not finalized. Compass will undertake to negotiate and consummate such transaction using commercially reasonable efforts and remaining in compliance with applicable sanctions and export laws, but there is no guarantee that such transaction will occur, and the price of such transaction is still uncertain. To receive any refund or proceeds, you will be required to complete any applicable know your customer documentation as required by Compass.

Please indicate your approval for Compass to proceed with the negotiated transaction on your behalf with respect to your hardware by completing this **form** on or before 5:00pm Eastern Standard Time on April 23, 2022. ¬†Failure to grant the approval will result in you having to manage your hardware directly, without Compass‚Äô further involvement.

As indicated above, Compass is no longer participating in any business relationship with BitRiver due to U.S. sanctions. ¬†If you choose not to participate in the negotiated sale of equipment that Compass is working to accomplish, your hardware will be left in Russia and you will have to undertake any further action on your own. ¬†You may contact BitRiver directly by visiting their website at [https://bitriver.farm/en/contact](https://bitriver.farm/en/contact). ¬†If you are a U.S. person you are likely prohibited from negotiating or transacting in any capacity directly or indirectly with BitRiver in light of the OFAC sanctions and designations. ¬†Moreover, your equipment may be subject to the export control laws and regulations of all related countries, including but not limited to the Export Administration Regulations (‚ÄúEAR‚Äù) of the United States. ¬†You should seek your own legal counsel if you choose not to participate and grant the requested approval to Compass to negotiate the proposed transaction.

Thank you for your continued trust in Compass. ¬†We truly value your relationship and look forward to finding a positive resolution in light of the unfortunate circumstances.

**Liquidation approval form:** 

Very truly yours,

u9rim2,notjustok22,5,https://redd.it/u9rim2,None,WAYS TO SPEND LESS ON ELECTRICITY AND MAKE MORE,"First of all, pls forgive my clickbait headline, I needed to get as much response as possible. 

I live in Africa and I am working on setting up a hosting facility.
 Electricity here is very cheap, thou not 247 like western countries 
But the place I am planning to setup my miners boost of atleast 20hours of power supply. The remaining 4 hours I will back up with a diesel generator.

For you to have an idea of how cheap electricity is
I can decide to house atleast 300. S9 miners and be charged $2000 per month for power. I will have my own 500kva transformer 
I then spend another $3000 max on diesel for my back up generator. I am sure this is cheaper than most western countries electricity rate.


Now my questions are

1. What miners will ensure I ROI fast? I am thinking s9s but I am looking for more suggestions.

2. Power here is not constant, also nobody knows when the power companies will switch off the supply, but it can happen anytime during the day and most times twice or thrice, power will be cut off for atleast 1 hour on each occasion. We just don't know when

Will these affect the miners in the long run, will it also affect their output( when power is cutoff, the diesel generator kicks in automatically, there is always 2 minutes lapse thou

3. Does shipping containers reduces the noise level, these way neighbors wont have to deal with loud noises in the night or should I pad the shipping containers

4. Bitcoin mining is fairly new here in my country
What happens when  our machines goes bad,
My plan is to have an engineer work full time with us(someone who fixed laptop /phones) I am.hoping this with YouTube videos and other guidelines he might be able to fix them, do you think this is advisable
Having to spend money shipping these miners back to China for repairs is ridiculous.

5. If I decide to buy S9s since they can hit ROI faster, 
Does a new S9 make more money than a refurbished one over the same period of time, say one day.

As with any vital hardware equipment running constantly at full capacity, ASIC miners are prone to breaking down from time to time. No matter how expected such an event may be, it is always an inconvenience that costs money and nerves. This is why it is key to collaborate with the right companies to provide the fastest and highest quality repair services to keep your operation up and running at full capacity. Most manufacturers provide only one year warranty at best, but we all know a miner can have a much longer lifespan if maintained properly.

The list was in dire need of a reliable provider of repair services and components, this is why we now included Meta-Luban as an official top rated Seller. Yes, even if their main focus is providing miner servicing, they are also a reliable player in ASIC components and ASIC miners retail, both new and used. They're an official repair services provider authorized by both Canaan Avalon and Antminer, which means that all parts used in repairing rigs from these brands are all-original and authorized. They've been up and running for 3 years now, employing an experienced team of technicians versed in every aspect of ASIC maintenance. In other words, nothing surprises these guys. Couple that with affordable rates and you got yourself the ideal specialized partner to keep your operation up and running smoothly.

When ordering used rigs from them, they also provide the full refurbishment treatment, which consists of casing refurbishment, internal dust cleaning, old power cables and fans replacement, as well as a full analysis report and proof of full capacity working capabilities of the miner.

That being said, as it is the case with most Chinese companies, the only payment options they offer are USDT and wire, so don't expect credit card anytime soon.

Quite often per day, the market dumps those 60min contracts for up to -500‚Ç¨/MWh as the grid has instability/there is a lot of oversupplies. Yes rebate, you get paid if you are able to consume the power on such short notice. 

So switching on 2 MW might be the easier part but needing to repeatedly switch them off again after 60 mins when the next contract has not the suitable price and then on again later when you are able to scoop the next contract?

Any suggestion on how that is manageable? At least you have lead time ahead of switching on and off.

Let's say you can manage the cool-off period after switching off with external fans, how bad is it for the miners? 

Is there a way to fasten up the connection to a pool? Maybe self mining is the better option? 

Also, I heard some about a ""sleep mode"" is that something that could work as you know exactly when the power comes and goes?

In what can only be called an extraordinary display of opacity, and maybe deceitfulness, WATTAM has listed their Russian holdings as being in CIS (Confederation of Independent States) on their website. The CIS is not a nation, and not really much of a political entity at all. It is a very useful entity for Russia to hide behind to attempt to skirt western sanctions, however, and WATTAM is playing ball. 

I would avoid having any machines hosted at WATTAM's ""CIS"" facilities if you're a citizen of the West. You could get yourself in trouble.",1,bitcoinmining,2022-04-26 04:05:19

ucjwyh,Bitcoin_Barons,6,https://redd.it/ucjwyh,None,Compass Mining - AVOID Like The Plague,"Im sure a lot of you have heard of the new US sanctions on Russian miners specifically bitriver.

Compass mining had their russian facilities hosted with them, 4000 miners at these locations.

While it can be argued that they could not see the sanctions coming (if they had the right government connections they would), their handling of the situation has been terrible.

1. They offered to liquidate your miners but would not give you a price before while giving you only 48 hours to decide (they have since changed their stance on this due to poor uptake).
2. They are not providing serial numbers for the russian miners even tho they claimed they will on friday
3. They refuse to even send any sort of ownership attestation to bitriver to allow their non us customers to host directly with them
4. They have still yet to provide transfer of ownership documents to the customers directly
5. It seems with compass you actually do not own anything, and they are just running a cloud mining scam and telling you, that you own the miners
6. They have yet to provide a refund for hosting that their russian customers prepaid for. Compass postpays bitriver so they basically stole this money.
7. They have not provided a return of the 1 month deposit (which is paid when you buy a new miner contract) on the russian miners either. Basically stole this money as well and at best try to pay you off in ""credits"" instead of refunding btc/fiat which you paid in.

Be very careful and would advise people not to deal with such a shady company. On the flip side the russian host is trying to accomodate non us customers, but compass just keeps saying ""our hands are tied"".

Took it on the chin with this one. Have a lot of american miners with them which I will liquidate asap as well.

I only kept on adding more so that I can withdraw without issue since they were asking me to pay maintenance fees. First they said you can use basic pool only once, to withdraw you need to enter Algo pool which can be used 5 times, by the time I put $50000 and asked for withdrawal they shared a fake invoice with me saying bank transfer was initiated. And $50000 was hard earned money from my job and not from trading or crypto currency. Believe me I am new to this crypto current world itself.

uegfxp,Sariah_jb,1,https://redd.it/uegfxp,None,BTC mining has increased its use of sustainable energy by 59 percent in a year.,"According to the Bitcoin Mining Council's (BMC) quarterly report released on Monday, the global Bitcoin mining industry increased its sustainable energy mix by approximately 59 percent year over year (YoY). Mining efficiency has increased by 63 percent year over year, according to the report.
The Bitcoin Mining Council is a non-profit global organisation that claims to represent the Bitcoin network as a whole.

According to the report, the mining industry consumes 16 percent of global energy and emits only 8 percent of carbon emissions. According to the data, BMC expects a 3X and 2X increase in mining efficiency over the next four and next four years, respectively. Bitcoin's energy consumption on the global electrical grid is 247 TWh (0.16 percent), compared to 154,750 TWh of global total energy generation.

Recently, blockchain and the crypto industry have been chastised for their extensive use of electricity. Proof-of-Work mining and Bitcoin were the focus of intense US government scrutiny in January due to their high energy consumption. Furthermore, US lawmakers are concerned about the environmental impact of Proof-of-Work (PoW) mining. Despite the fact that I am an Ethereum supporter, the last few weeks have not been kind to Ethereum, as the upgrade from pow to pos has been delayed yet again, and this delay has been going on for a long time, negatively impacting Ethereum while other efficient options such as algorand and cardano have soared. As a result of this efficiency frenzy, more and more projects are becoming more efficient from the start, such as Fantom, which uses the DAG protocol, and Bob Eco Coin, which helps the environment heal by planting trees.

What are your thoughts on whether the delay will have an impact on Ethereum's expected price?",6,bitcoinmining,2022-04-29 07:20:31

SafeTek Solutions is a Bitcoin mining company, based in Texas. ([www.safeteksolutions.com](http://www.safeteksolutions.com/)) We have built our TX facility for repairing **our** own fleet of 17 series Antminers that have failed mainly due to the low-temperature solder Bitmain used in the manufacturing of these miners. The low-temp. solder will cause the heatsinks to fall off/shift as well as allow the solder to melt off the surface area of the chip. Both of which will short out the chip, which will short out your board.

We genuinely refurbish these miners and I can tell you more in-depth info. about our process if you‚Äôre interested. I can assure you that the monolithic heatsinks attached at the end of the process are not the most important part of the repair... Unfortunately, there‚Äôs a lot of ‚Äúcompanies‚Äù slapping heatsinks on these boards without getting the Bitmain solder off of the board and calling them ‚Äúrefurbished‚Äù. Please be aware!

We can accommodate single miner orders all the way up to 1000+ miner orders.

T17+: $3,025

S17+: $4,015

The miners are sold as is, but we do honor a DOA warranty.

If there‚Äôs any issues or you just need some support, we will promptly be by your side 100% of the time ready to assist in any way you may need. Contact me for pictures of the hashboards if you're curious what they look like after the process. Thanks.

Trying to wrap my head around the following hypothetical, sorry if it's a noob question:

Say you buy one of the better miners now (e.g. Antminer S19 XP - 140TH/s) and get it hosted in the U.S. 

You start mining and in less than 2 years, about March 2024, the next Bitcoin halving happens.

Will that cut all of our profitability in half and mean you have to get to miner break-even (cost of purchase etc) before then?

What's the right way to think about this still being profitable after March 2024? Is there a good calculator that accounts for hosting fees etc and what happens in 2 years?

ufb4x7,hyperhappy2,29,https://redd.it/ufb4x7,None,"Logic question: Buy 1 BTC vs. 3x S19s - halving, income vs cap gains tax, cost","Hey everybody,

Trying to wrap my head around the following:

With the March 2024 halving and the $10k+ costs for S19s (+ hosting fees + electricity + maintenance + risk of breaking/loss), is it smarter to try to buy 1 BTC instead of buying 3x miners?

Consideration 1 - TAX:  Mining income gets taxes at about 20-30% income tax rate yearly but Bitcoin price increase gets taxed a about 10-15% and only when sold.

Consideration 2 - competition, better ASICs: This will likely continue to increase, including from foreign miners with much cheaper power access. Also, better ASICs would make current S19s worth a lot less for re-sale and less competitive for mining.

Consideration 1 - halving: next halving is less than 2 years away, not enough time to break even?  

Doesn't all this point towards a much better outcome, AFTER TAXES, for simply buying BTC?

ufl2ys,tweak722,8,https://redd.it/ufl2ys,None,The mining industry's race to the bottom - Here is why,"Similar to market of supertankers and other ships, the actors tend to get overconfident in good times, and order new vessels, backed by banks which is presented with incomes based on current conditions. The outcome is inevitable every cycle. There are too many ships getting into the market, and everyone is fighting for jobs to at least cover their financial liabilities.

I see similarities in the crypto mining industry. Lately we get big companies backed by loans which is purchasing whopping numbers of ASIC's. This contributes to increasing hashrate and reduced outcome for each participant, to a level where paying financial liabilities and electric power is the bare operating minimum.  Power consumption increases to an extent where entire countries see no other choice but to ban the activity. 

From here I see a race to the bottom, to find countries with cheapest electric power, cheapest labor and lowest possible tax contribution. A new SHA-256 miner today will have an expected life span of 4-5 years, and ROI in about 2-3 depending on the crypto price development and interest on loans. It is apparently seen as an attractive investment to get the value of equipment back, and then another 40-80% on top of that before writing it off. In terms of money we can mortgage about $14500 today on a S19 140XP and after 5 years of operating and maintaining this miner, we are left with $6-10 000 after paying down the loans. Somebody  see this a attractive, but keep in mind that the yearly salary over those 5 years is only $1000-2000. So you need to have many, in fact you need to have at least 50-100 of them to make a decent salary for ONE man after taxes are paid. But like in shipping industry, for some this is OK, specially if you live in a poor country.

Some says you can stack the coin and wait for price to go up, but you cant really stack anything when you are forced to constantly exchange to USD for paying off your mortgage and electricity, and a salary you can live off.  What are we left with then? A rising price will likely affect the price of the gear itself, but this requires some proper market timing. 

And then back to the analogy with ships. The people who make most in this market are the one who buy up ships from overleveraged companies forced to sell in the downturn, chug them along until the upturn comes, and then sell them again. It looks like we are heading in this direction with mining gear as well, but the lifespan of a miner is much shorter than a vessel, so there will be limited chances to live through a market cycle for each generation of ASIC.

The situation now is that each day, the floor price of what  BTC can go to before mining is unprofitable is rising every day. Mining with a mortgaged new machine is soon expected to be unprofitable at Bitcoin price about  $20 000 with normal electricity cost, and 4% mortgage rate, given a rise in hashrate to 300EH/s. So to create a significant downturn for mining gear, it is ""enough"" with a drop to this level.",2,bitcoinmining,2022-04-30 21:58:21

For the upcoming two years, all future proof-of-work cryptocurrency mining operations, such as Bitcoin mining operations, will be actually prohibited in New York City.
Bitcoin miners will be soon outlawed.

Due to environmental concerns, proposed restrictions on proof-of-work virtual currencies are becoming increasingly widespread. The European Parliament barely vetoed a similar proposal known as the Markets in Crypto Assets bill in late March. In that proposal, the MPs were proposing a restriction on Bitcoin trade to enforce the planned ban on mining.

The new legislation is mainly aimed at Proof-of-Work cryptocurrencies that use a lot of power or other forms of energy. Future Bitcoin mining miners will be unable to get a licence to operate. The existing miners who wish to renew their licences will be unable to do so until alternate energy sources are found.

Laws do not obscure the impact of Cryptocurrency mining, and the rise in acceptance of cryptocurrency necessitates quick solutions. Recently, we've seen companies like Hello Pal expand their operations to Australia, which appears to be the next mining destination.

The New York State Assembly approves a law prohibiting the construction of new bitcoin miners that do not utilize inexperienced energy. The New York State Assembly passed a bill late Tuesday, April 26, that will impose a two-year moratorium on any new proof-of-work cryptocurrency mining facilities that utilize carbon-based gas to power their operations.

The bill filed by Anna Kelly would put a two-year ban on the approval of any new mines. Still, it would also prevent the renewal of licenses provided to current PoW cryptocurrency miners that use carbon-sourced electricity from increasing the amount of electrical energy utilized. Many new initiatives have recently joined the recycling management ecosystem, with projects such as PLAS, Plastiks, SETS and others attempting to make an impact with their reward-based recycling management system.

Another clause would make it illegal to renew current permits for identical facilities if the renewal applicant intends to expand their business. The measure also requires the state to prepare a ""generic environmental impact assessment"" that assesses PoW mining and mining facilities throughout the state.

Laws do not obscure the impact of Bitcoin mining, and the rise in popularity of the cryptocurrency necessitates quick solutions.

According to a joint announcement released Wednesday, Upstate Interactive worked on UI/UX development for Foundry's staking business, which began last year in November.

Foundry will combine different business lines for Upstate Interactive as part of the new agreement and supply institutions with various goods and services connected to the digital asset infrastructure layer.

The successful launch of the initiative sparked takeover negotiations between the two companies. However, the specifics of the deal are undisclosed. According to the statement, Upstate Interactive's capabilities will now be integrated into Foundry's products. Talking about mining, recently a news came to light which described how much e-waste is generated via these mining projects. To tackle this abrupt situation many projects came forwards and devised a lucrative waste management protocol, where companies like Plastik, SET, ZeLoop, etc, reward users who dump waste through their ecosystem.

Foundry also launched Foundry, a marketplace for bitcoin mining hardware, last year. After launching one, it quickly grew to become one of the largest bitcoin mining pools. Through equipment sales, finance, the Foundry USA Pool, and consultation services, the firm delivers money and intelligence to North American digital asset mining companies. It has recently begun to place a greater emphasis on proof of stake services.

Upstate Interactive's three partners and co-founders are equally ecstatic with the transaction. ""Joining Foundry expands the blockchain space's possibilities even farther, especially considering our common roots in Upstate New York,"" said Zoe Koulouris Augustinos.

ugykq5,SamanthaPiper437,0,https://redd.it/ugykq5,None,"BITFARMS MINED 405 BITCOIN IN APRIL, NOW HOLDS 5,646 BTC","Bitfarms released a bitcoin mining update detailing a 75% YoY increase in production and the custodying of 99% of total mined BTC in April. Bitcoin was one of the slowest but more profitable mining streams similar to Ethereum which also doubles down as a fuel to various block chain projects like Decentraland, Sandbox, Champions Playverse which is a platform that gives users access to staking opportunitiess, Hydrominer and so on.

Bitcoin production numbers and a mining operations report for April 2022 were revealed by Bitfarms, a publicly traded bitcoin mining firm. 
For the month, total income hit 405 BTC, garnering a total of $15.6 million. 
Bitfarms now has a reserve of 5,646 BTC, worth about $218 million, after 403 BTC were transferred into custody out of 405 BTC mined.

According to a press statement issued to Bitcoin Magazine, Bitfarms Ltd. (Nasdaq: BITF, TSX: BITF), a worldwide distributed mining firm, released a production update for April 2022 indicating a 75 percent year-over-year (YoY) increase in bitcoin mined.

Last month, Bitfarms mined a total of 405 BTC worth around $15.6 million, with a daily average of 13.5 BTC worth approximately $522,000 at the time of writing. The significant increase can be ascribed in part to an increase in hashing power, as Bitfarms reported a 22 percent increase in hashing power from 2.7 exahash per second (EH/s) in March to 3.3 EH/s in April. 

""With the launch of production at our Leger farm, our ninth operating facility, we reached our 3 exahash per second objective (EH/s) in early April,"" stated Emiliano Grodzki, CEO of Bitfarms, in the release.

‚ÄúThis incremental capacity helped drive our average daily production in April to 13.5 BTC/day, up 15% from 11.7 BTC/day in March, and I‚Äôm proud to say we exited April running at over 14 BTC/day.‚Äù

Bitfarms was able to achieve much of its growth by installing 5,900 new miners, which resulted in the 590 petahash per second (PH/s) rise noted earlier. To accommodate not just the addition of new miners, but also future miners, the total electrical capacity was increased from 16 megawatts (MW) to 137 megawatts (MW). 

The Leger site in Sherbrooke, Qu√©bec, was inaugurated, bringing 16 megawatts of electrical power online and with the potential to expand to 30 megawatts. Leger expands Bitfarms' global mining facilities to nine.

""We're still on schedule to finish the Leger build out in May, as well as the second phase of development at The Bunker in June."" These actions are projected to add around 640 petahash per second (PH/s) to our online hashrate when combined with continuing miner installs, according to Grodzki. 

403 BTC were deposited into custody out of the 405 BTC mined in April. Bitfarms now has a reserve of 5,646 BTC as of April 30, 2022, worth approximately $218.5 million at the time of writing.

A proprietary program for the management of miners, which has been in beta testing for the past nine months, is now being released, according to the business.

ui1rs5,AthenaMaria657,1,https://redd.it/ui1rs5,None,"Crypto Mining, the Energy Crisis and the End of ESG","Nic Carter, co-founder of Coin Metrics shared his opinion on crypto mining, talking about the tedious and enervating debate regarding bitcoin‚Äôs (BTC) purported environmental costs. The cause was not the revelation that miners are the most benevolent industrial consumers possible, providing a valuable source of flexible load that will accelerate a green energy transition like Bob Eco, Power Ledger and FlexiDao. Nor was it that the bitcoin mining industry is more transparent, more sustainable, better understood, and more accountable than it has ever been.

‚ÄúRecent events also make bitcoin‚Äôs utility starkly clear, even as its energy impact rises. In the 1970s, when the U.S. defaulted on its promise to maintain the gold peg and inflation ran rampant as a consequence, the price of gold soared from $35 an ounce to $675, or a factor of nine in real terms. Counterintuitively, the resource costs associated with gold extraction increased when gold lost its official status. The more gold was worth, the greater the bounty available to miners. So production increased dramatically, as did the associated energy and ecological costs.‚Äù

‚ÄúBitcoin mining sites are no different than data centers operated by mega-cap tech firms such as Amazon, Apple, Google, Meta and Microsoft‚Äù, he wrote.

ui1tya,Allyson765,10,https://redd.it/ui1tya,None,"As Fort Worth, Texas Set to Become First U.S. City To Mine Bitcoin. Are other Cities likely to Start mining also?","The municipal council of Fort Worth has approved a pilot Bitcoin mining operation as part of a package of initiatives aimed at transforming the city into a major technology centre.
According to a CNBC story, Fort Worth Mayor Mattie Parker oversaw the development of a tiny Bitcoin mining farm in City Hall.

The city installed three Bitmain Antminer S9s. The rigs will run 24 hours a day, seven days a week in the City Hall building's climate-controlled environment, with each machine consuming roughly the same amount of electricity as a family vacuum cleaner. To ensure security, the city claims that the mining rigs will be connected to a secret network.
Mayor Parker, who became the city's mayor last year, said she does not expect the mining operation to be profitable. Instead, she hopes the project will help to place Fort Worth on the national map as a Bitcoin and digital asset mining hotspot.

I think it is quite interesting to see Bitcion being accepted by government at various levels. The cryptocurrency's success can be attributed to the innovative nature of it's technology and it's intrinsic  value. Which no doubt is hard for government institutions to ignore has more and more people opt to use the technology.
Recently we have witnessed more countries and financial institutions adopt Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies which would no doubt help accelerate the development of the blockchain ecosystem as a whole and facilitate the creation of more innovative projects that cater to unique needs in the ecosystem like Silks a blockchain-based metaverse that enables users to own, trade, and profit from thoroughbred racing horses  Faith tribe which is a platform for creating trading, distribution, and monetization of designs of fashion, Luckyblock which  is a digital asset project that decentralizies the lottery process via blockchain technology feasible are gradually gaining ground.

However it seems that the acceptance of Bitcoin and altcoins into the mainstream might not necessarily translate to acceptance of Bitcoin mining.
Bitcoin as we all know has been heavily critizied because of the amount of energy it requires to operate 
and just recently NewYork senate passed a bill issuing a moratorium of bitcoin mining within the state. I think any major state or city that gets into the mining scene might come under fire by the public due to the perceived environmental impact of Bitcoin mining.
I think that any city that chooses to mine Bitcoin would have to provide assurances of an eco-friendly mining system.

Does the world with our current grid even produce enough energy to support a Bitcoin worth $500.000 on top of all other things we need energy for?

If mining one bitcoin is split equally between equipment-costs and energy-costs it would cost $250.000 of energy per Bitcoin mined. With 6.25 btc mined every 10 minutes world wide that is $156.250 a minute spend on energy. With 1440 minutes in a day that is 225 million every day.

Can our energy grids really handle another ~$7 billion of electricity monthly? To put that in comparison, the US has about 127 million households of 2.6 people. Their monthly electricity bill is $115 on average, this is about $14 billion of electricity monthly.

Adding half an US to grids around the world within the time that Bitcoin hits $500.000 seems like quite a challenge.

Now that Bitcoin is in range, we might see the first wave of miners shut off their older ASIC models potentially leading to lower mining difficulty and more BTC block rewards. 

The best way to invest in Bitcoin mining with crypto is to purchase ASICs with BTC when BTC is high. The best way to invest in Bitcoin mining with fiat is to purchase ASICs with dollars when BTC is low.

To accommodate for Bitcoin's drop in price, Wattum has prepared a special bundle package of 2x Antminer S19 totaling a combined hashing power of 200 Th/s for sale with shipping from the USA. This new bundle is known as Wattum's '**Thoroughbred Miner Package**' and will inculde 1x Antminer S19 (96TH) and 1x Antminer S19J Pro (104TH).

ulxiwo,AsicJungle,0,https://redd.it/ulxiwo,None,‚ÄúWhat Is The Best Miner to Buy‚Äù And Why This Question Doesn‚Äôt Work.,"When starting to mine BTC, one of the most common questions is what machine to start out with. This makes sense, as there are lots of different machines out there, some costing over $20,000 per unit. When asking this question one needs to be careful. It‚Äôs important to  understand that a profitable mining operation implies assessing variables that may affect what is the best ASIC for you. If there even is a ‚Äúcorrect answer‚Äù üëÄ

One of the major components when beginning to mine BTC is the electricity costs associated with it. Whether you are mining out of your home, hosting, or building a larger-scale mining operation the electricity costs plays the largest role in the profitability of each unit. For example, if you have a higher electricity cost ( >$0.08), then running a latest generation (M30S+/S19) unit may be the better option since you have to maximize the total output per power consumption. 

If you have cheaper electricity, it may be more beneficial to get cheaper hardware with lower TH output in order to decrease the ROI time.   
For example, an S9 purchased for $300 and operated at $0.01/kwh power (yes that exists in certain places in the world!) will typically ROI faster than an S19 costing $7000 operated at the same site. Obviously, this equation does not consider difficulty adjustments and the overall life expectancy of each unit. However on $0.08/kwh electricity, it is wiser to run newer hardware as it will be almost impossible to profit from older units, or too risky.   


In short, the last paragraph demonstrates that assessing a unit's value based on a $/TH term may not always be the best option. A basic return on investment (ROI) calculation should always precede your decision making as the cost of a miner does not determine the overall quality of your investment. However mining is not only about the amount of coin that you mine each day, but what that amount will be worth overtime. Imagine mining as an operation where you are daily-cost-averaging (DCAing) yourself into bitcoin over time, but where your machine should pay for itself and even retain or increase in value in the future. The problem that you, as an operator, are essentially trying to solve is how to get to that point the fastest, and in the most efficient manner.   


That being said, machine prices should never be the only variable that a beginner miner should be looking at. Rather, try to focus on maximizing the profitability of your mining operation along with your capital deployment capabilities, by including external parameters such as your electricity costs.   


We always welcome people to start discussions and ask more questions! 

As always, you can also reach out to us by DM if you have any questions or are looking for hardware that‚Äôs properly priced to help you achieve your mining goals faster. Happy Mining!",4,bitcoinmining,2022-05-09 18:16:13

uoycio,Bitcoin_Barons,15,https://redd.it/uoycio,None,Compass Mining - Poorly Managed Company - Possibly Insolvent,"Hello,

Just wanted to let people know to NEVER deal with a company like compass mining. Here are the reasons.

1. They claim that you ""own"" the machines, yet you actually have no control over these machines. Im caught up in the russian fiasco and literally can do nothing with the machines for 3 weeks, despite them terminating the contract 3 weeks ago. They basically seized the machines.
2. They are contractually obligated to pay out deposits for hosting contracts if terminated. They terminated russian hosting contracts 3 weeks ago and still have not paid out. They claimed to do it this week, but all we receive is ""check your emails"" from their ceo. Makes me think they dont even have the money to pay this out. This is thousands for some people and probably only 500K for compass.
3. They claimed they would send ownership details and serial numbers out to the russian hosting partner so we could make our own arrangements. It has been 3 weeks and this still has not been done, and multiple people claiming serial number discrepencies. They claimed this would be done last friday. Poor record keeping or other shady things going on. Also, deliberately stalling.
4. They claimed there would be some sort of sale, but no guarantees. Still no details on said sale. Fine no guarantees, but then release our property and let us do what we want with it like moving it to a non sanctioned entity/host. Keeping us both in the dark and limbo at the same time.
5. They recently started spamming their list again, making me think they are short on cash.
6. They claim you ""own"" the machines but unless you can have visibility into their balance sheet/financial situation, they may be holding them on there. If they go bankrupt you lose all your miners and have to line up in bankruptcy court. It is exact same with coinbase, when you deposit funds there if coinbase goes bankrupt you are an unsecured creditor and wait in line at bankruptcy court.
7. Their investor is the same people behind Luna/Terra which just collapsed, doubt they will receive new investment anytime soon.
8. More possible misrepresentation of ownership to hosting partners. After reaching out to their host partner to make my own arrangements this is literally their verbatim response from them ""From a legal and regulatory point of view all equipment is owned by compass.Your relationship with this company is regulated within different legal framework. In this respect, be advised that you remain a customer of compass. Thus address queries to them""
9. They lost a good amount of revenue from the russian fiascoas well at least $500K in monthly cashflow.

&#x200B;

Overall I have never dealt with such a poorly managed company, and their financial position is completely opaque, making anyone who bought with them at risk as well.

After this whole Luna fiasco when are people in crypto going to learn not to trust third parties, and understand these companies dont have your interest at hand.  I myself was duped.

Good luck and just HODL.",16,bitcoinmining,2022-05-13 18:40:44

upn4c7,Hailey7644,2,https://redd.it/upn4c7,None,Proposed Crypto Mining Ban in Norway Fails to Gain Support in Parliament. Shouldn't legislations promote Eco- Friendly mining instead of outright Ban on Crypto Mining?,"
The Norwegian parliament debated and rejected a draft bill prohibiting the minting of digital currencies based on the proof-of-work principle. Only two other leftist parties, SV (the Socialist Left Party) and MdG, supported the law, which was introduced by the communist Red Party in March (the Green Party).

""Obviously, the majority here disappoints us,"" Red legislator Sofie Marhaug told the E24 news outlet. She also stated that the Norwegian society must establish its electricity usage priorities. Her party claims bitcoin mining is extremely energy-intensive and insists on prioritizing other businesses' requirements as well as climate change goals. 

The Red Party also failed to gain support for a proposal to reduce the electricity surcharge for mining data centers, claiming that the Labor Party (Ap) and the Centre Party (Sp) had broken a pre-election commitment. The two parties had announced that mining farms will be charged a full electricity tariff.

The Norwegian government stated in February that it would aim to avoid enforcing a crypto ban, but that it was investigating alternative steps to reduce the sector's electricity use. 

In my opinion crypto mining legislations should not aim outright ban of mining but should to crub the excesses of fellow who would rather mine at the expense of electricity companies and the environment at Large. I think it will only be reasonable to put in place laws that regulate electricity use and other conditions for miners so that mining operations are has eco friendly has possible.

I think that With the growing popularity of web3 innovative projects such as  Decentraland  an online world that allows users to create their own avatars and purchase plots of virtual land, Planet Maya which is powered by champions games is a decentralized and collaborative online casino which allows developers to build Games around betting, Luckyblock which  is a digital asset project that decentralizies the lottery process via blockchain technology, Silks a blockchain based metaverse that enables users to own, trade, and profit from thoroughbred racing horses  cryptocurrencies will only become more valuable. 
So it will only be to detriment of miners , innovation and the growing crypto ecosystem to ban crypto  mining. 
Laws should rather  regulate mining companies and not ban them. However it would only be logical that  these  laws should not be stringent to the extent that they frustrate mining operations therefore putting miners out if business.

uqdt2d,Eileen755,4,https://redd.it/uqdt2d,None,"Bitcoin Mining With Next Halving Being A Year And Half To Go, Will History Repeat Itself?","For newbs yet to understand how mining really works, it's obvious people can always send bitcoins (or any other digital assets) all the time, but it doesn‚Äôt mean much unless someone keeps tabs on all of them. 

This is especially true with digital assets which are super easy to copy. So to have a fully functioning digital cash you need to keep a record on who paid what and to whom, and that‚Äôs essentially what banks do for us. 
 
But how do we know that person A has sent tokens, let's say some not very popular tokens like Golden Ball, Minosis, or Blitz to person B if there are no organizations to oversee it? How do we prevent double-spending where person A sends the same tokensto person C?  

The answer is mining and in the case of BTC it's bitcoin mining.  
The Bitcoin network replaces banks and other intermediaries by processing all the network transactions, putting them into a list, and locking them up into immutable blocks. Eventually, it‚Äôs the miners who do all the work - allocate their hashing power to confirm those transactions and record them into a distributed public ledger.  Bitcoin mining requires a computer and special Bitcoin program (client). 
When you install Bitcoin client on your computer, you become a miner and can compete with rival miners in solving complex math puzzles. Every ten minutes, all computers try to solve a block with the latest transaction data in it using cryptographic hash functions.  Now that halfway to the halving we're experiencing something of a crash, what are your thoughts with the next halving?",13,bitcoinmining,2022-05-15 19:43:08

TIA,"Hi, I‚Äôve done a lot of reading but am still struggling to figure out some of the technicals on the network/node communication system. My simple question is: 1) how much will a 250ms steady ping affect monthly revenue? 400ms?  

And if you‚Äôre feeling frisky, my second question would be: 2) is it possible to receive the block header at block time 0, begin hashing nonces, lose connection for 1 full second during which I guess the target value, reestablish connection and process the block for network validation? 

My general understanding is: 

Q1) Because valid blocks require network consensus, we would expect an inherent time delay to reach that (about 12.6 seconds, I think the median is 7 seconds but 96% complete by 12.6s).  Therefore the difference from 70ms to 250ms (and even higher like 600ms), is really creating a 1-7% loss ‚Äòwastage‚Äô window. And so will create measurable lost, but not as bad as people make it seem. This data is hard to come by.

Q2) in line with above, the shorter the loss of connection, the lower your probability of wastage, higher your expected value.

Can anyone confirm and explain this more technically? Kudos if you have verifiable data to back it up.  Thanks.",0,bitcoinmining,2022-05-18 04:28:09

uvwtxs,NeedleworkerDeep4078,4,https://redd.it/uvwtxs,None,Solar viable for a small ASIC farm?,"My local power company is seeking a 18% raise... Current rate is .07c/kwh USD.

I'm in talks with a solar installer trying to see if it's feasible to run solar at my shop on a small scale (30KW).  My concern is where I have a demand meter, it's based on highest 15 minute monthly usage.  According to what I'm being told I can get a battery system that would/could offer around 6 hours of backup time for needed capacity.

Granted I don't know much about demand meter usage, just what I've been told by the utility company so I guess if I ""run out"" of solar power and the demand goes back to where it currently is via power provided by the utility company the solar power I'm receiving would basically be useless due to still having to pay for the demand?

My farm consists of 8 ASIC (7 Whatsminer and 1 S19)  running approx 670TH total.  I know I should probably get all S19s since they are more efficient but right now it is what it is...

EDIT:  Few additional points... I do have my ""farm"" setup as a LLC and it shares a building with a dedicated 7k sq/ft shop that I own, so from a business standpoint I could use the solar as a write off.  It will not be at a residential home.  ",2,bitcoinmining,2022-05-23 10:06:45

ux0d5y,peterhoegir,2,https://redd.it/ux0d5y,None,Bitcoin Mining has made China helpless,"According to research released this week, carbon-intensive bitcoin mining might cause China to overshoot its emissions reduction objectives.

According to the survey, China accounts for 75 percent of global bitcoin mining due to inexpensive power and relatively simple access to manufacturers of specialist hardware. As a result, according to the research, the country's bitcoin carbon footprint is equivalent to one of its ten largest cities.


Unlike other types of currency produced by a single institution such as a central bank, Bitcoin is decentralized and must be ""mined.""

Since July, Bitcoin has been on a five-day fall, bringing its price to its lowest point. Other currencies, such as Threedium, Metaloop, MetaTokyo Faith Tribe, and others, have suffered comparable losses due to the economic downturn.

Although Beijing prohibits bitcoin mining, Chinese miners aren't giving up. According to Cambridge University research, the country's proportion of global bitcoin mining capacity fell to zero in July and August 2021 after officials initiated a new crackdown on cryptocurrency.


China took several moves, including banning crypto mining, a power-intensive process that results in the production of new digital money. Several miners have fled to other nations, notably the United States and Kazakhstan, which borders China.

According to the researchers, this method might be subject to ""deliberate obfuscation"" by bitcoin miners who use a virtual private network to hide their location. VPNs allow users to route their traffic throughout a server in another country, making them useful tools for persons in countries where internet access is highly restricted, such as China.",0,bitcoinmining,2022-05-24 20:34:41

We have built our TX facility for repairing our own fleet of 17 series Antminers that have failed mainly due to the low-temperature solder Bitmain used in the manufacturing of these miners. The low-temp. solder will cause the heatsinks to fall off/shift as well as allow the solder to melt off the surface area of the chip. Both of which will short out the chip, which will short out your board. It is NOT a heatsink issue like many believe.

We genuinely refurbish these miners and we can assure you that the monolithic heatsinks attached at the end of the process are not the most important part of the repair... Unfortunately, there‚Äôs a lot of ‚Äúcompanies‚Äù slapping heatsinks on these boards without getting the Bitmain solder off of the board and calling them ‚Äúrefurbished‚Äù. Please be aware!

S17+: $2940

T17+: $2310

The miners are sold as is, but we do honor a DOA warranty and offer full technical support for anything involving your operation. We're creating a repair/warranty program so our customers do NOT have to worry about the ""ifs"" when something goes wrong.

v179ca,routine_service,12,https://redd.it/v179ca,None,Questions and feedback about a new setup + Solar,"Hello everyone, my boss has tasked me with doing some research into setting up a a small scale mining operation. I have some experience with small GPU setups, but nothing on a larger scale. Just wanted to post my ideas and thought and see if I can get some feedback from actual experts. 

The idea is to set up a solar farm, about 600kW DC, and install a shack with about 25-30 S19j Pros to use the power. We work in the solar industry, so the solar equipment with be at cost value. Everything would be grid connected, no batteries, we sell the solar to the grid and run the miners from the grid as well. Located in western Canada.

**Container**
My initial thoughts would be to go with a small shipping container, maybe 9'. Put up a wall with some racking to separate the hot side from the cold. 500cfm per miner x 25 units is 12,500cfm. 20% extra puts it at 15,000cfm, so four ~3,800cfm fans set up in a 2x2 square should be enough to pull the air. 

Or go with a pre-built unit like a Hash Hut or B10Systems container.

**Power**
To go with 200A or 400A panels? You can get 11 miners per 200A (200A x 0.8 = 160A. 160A x 240V = 38,400W. 38,400W / 3,250W = 11.8) So it would be either three 200A panels or two 400A panels. There should be enough left over to run fans and some lights. 

**Networking**
Remote locations, so no wired connection is possible. Would require a 4G modem and a switch with enough ports. Anything I might be missing?

**Miners**
Looks like there are lots of options for this. Meta-Luban and Digital-Mining are a few that I've looked at, but I haven't reached out to anyone yet. Any recommendations for distributors in Canada? Just to avoid the import taxes.

Any suggestions or criticism is welcomed. Like I said, I'm new to this so trying to go through as much info as I can.",2,bitcoinmining,2022-05-30 19:01:40

I'd like to hear all your opinions about it.

According to any mining profit calculator, you need 18 months with S19JPRO 104T on a $0.05 kwh rate to get an ROI , assuming the rig costs $5,000.

But,

if you factor in Bitcoin's difficulty increase by roughly 4% monthly. This period shoots up to almost double. Since a year-long difficulty increase would be %50. $275 per month x 18 months \* 0.5 = that's $2,500 lost to difficulty!

I have a loan for two of my miners.  I pay 619 a month. I pay 800 for electricity in may. 

Total expenses are $1419

I mined $1107 worth of bitcoin in may. 

That is a loss of $300

I could unplug and still pay the loan out of pocket. 

So the dilemma is 

Unplug and pay $600 out of pocket

Keep mining, cash out to pay bills and take an overall $300 loss.

It uses 5438W of power, or 130.5 kwh per day which equals $13.05 @ $0.10/kwh.

So for $2,900 you earn $1.45 a day, with a break even point at exactly 2,000 days.

Also of note, it uses the same amount of power as their S19 XP Hydro that delivers 255 TH, so clearly they're just making room for the new ones at their plant.

SafeTek Solutions is a Bitcoin mining company, based in Texas. We have built our TX facility for repairing our own fleet of 17 series Antminers that have failed mainly due to the low-temperature solder Bitmain used in the manufacturing of these miners. The low-temp. solder will cause the heatsinks to fall off/shift as well as allow the solder to melt off the surface area of the chip. Both of which will short out the chip, which will short out your board. It is NOT a heatsink issue like many believe.

We genuinely refurbish these miners and we can assure you that the monolithic heatsinks attached at the end of the process are not the most important part of the repair... Unfortunately, there‚Äôs a lot of ‚Äúcompanies‚Äù slapping heatsinks on these boards without getting the Bitmain solder off of the board and calling them ‚Äúrefurbished‚Äù. Please be aware!

S17+: $2100

T17+: $1650

SafeTek Solutions will cover the cost of repairs in the event something goes wrong with your miner. These miners are very stable and strong hashing machines, so needing repairs is not likely...but we want to assure our customers that SafeTek will cover **all** of the ""ifs"" that could possibly happen.

vd15kr,aptIcamp,2,https://redd.it/vd15kr,None,NYC Mayor Adams Will Urge Gov. Hochul to Veto Anti-Bitcoin Mining Bill (Report). Would Enacting the Bill Adversely Affect the Growth of Bitcoin Mining in the US.,"New York City Mayor Eric Adams has come out against a bill that would put a two-year embargo on bitcoin mining plants in New York that are not entirely powered by renewable energy.

He believes that the prohibition will stifle the expansion of the bitcoin mining business in the US. The New York assembly enacted a contentious measure on June 3 that prohibits bitcoin mining firms from using carbon-based power sources.

Adams stated in a Monday interview with Chain's New York Business that he would push Governor Kathy Hochul to veto the law.

""I'm going to ask the governor to consider vetoing the bill that will stymie bitcoin in upstate New York.... When it comes to the billions of dollars spent on cryptocurrency, New York is the undisputed leader. ""We can't keep erecting obstacles,"" Adams, a well-known proponent of bitcoin adoption who notably stated that he would take his first bitcoin paychecks, said in the interview.

Adams called for the repeal of the BitLicense cryptocurrency regulatory licensing rule in April 2022, claiming that it was excessively strict and stifled innovation and economic growth.

The law is part of New York's effort to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 85% by 2050, as required by the Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act, which was passed by the legislature in 2019.

News Source: 
https://cryptopotato.com/nyc-mayor-adams-will-urge-gov-hochul-to-veto-anti-bitcoin-mining-bill-report/

I think that enacting the bill would have an adverse effect on Bitcoin mining industry in the US and I totally agree with the New York Mayor that enacting the bill could cause a chain reaction wherein  we would see other states enact similar laws outrightly banning mining. 

It is agreed that mining is energy intensive but that shouldn't equal outright ban I think that it is more plausible to place mechanism that require that miners operating a carbon-based power sources to renewal energy operations. Outright ban would only harm a thriving sector 

Bitcoin although in the midst of a massive price slump could arguably be the future of global monetary standards as Bitcoin and it's underlying technology blockchain are being increasingly accepted. I think banning an important component of a revolutionary technology lacks foresight.  
Different platforms across different industries adopting Blockchain technology/cryptocurrencies, Gucci now accepts payment is Bitcoin and some of it's alternatives, Meta Facebook's parent company has announced plans to integrate NFTs to it's platform and 
Tok Lok app  arguably the most secure messaging app with end to end encryption that does not collect or save messaging data amongst a host of examples. 

All in all enacting the Bill could see other states enacting similar laws/ more stringent laws for miners  thereby hampering the thriving US Bitcoin mining sector.",28,bitcoinmining,2022-06-15 18:25:40

vdsr8j,tIOuCTOr,3,https://redd.it/vdsr8j,None,Bitcoin miners stung as fallout from price collapse widens,"Bitcoin miners are reducing production as prices of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and even relatively new and promising projects like Concordium and Axie Infinity, fall and energy costs rise, reducing profits and slamming their stocks. 

Miners, who use powerful computers to create new bitcoin units and validate transactions on blockchains, have been forced to change course as falling crypto prices threaten to undermine their significant investment in technology. 

According to Blockchain.com data, the bitcoin hash rate, which measures the amount of power dedicated to creating new coins, has dropped 4% since the beginning of the week. The decrease suggests that digital miners are devoting fewer computing resources to solving complex puzzles in exchange for newly minted bitcoin.

According to Blockchain.com data, the total value of revenues paid to miners has also dropped to its lowest level in nearly a year. Marathon Digital and Hut 8 have lost about 40% of their value in the last month, while Argo Blockchain has lost 35%. 

""Right now, it's not fun to be in the mining business,"" said Alexander Neumueller, project lead for digital assets at the Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance. 

The crypto market has been strained by months of declines in its most valuable coins, reducing the market's value from a high of $3.2 trillion in November to just under $1 trillion.

Bitcoin has lost more than half of its value this year, trading below $21,000, with losses accelerating in recent weeks following the collapse of stablecoin terra and the blocking of funds from lending platform Celsius. 

""Many miners in the industry are affected by fluctuations in energy prices."" As a result, they are under pressure from two sources: high costs and lower revenue per bitcoin generated, according to Charlie Schumacher, a spokesperson for Marathon Digital, one of the world's largest bitcoin miners. 

In the first quarter, Marathon spent more than $200 million on mining-related investments. 

Larger operations typically have fixed energy costs and larger buffers to fall back on, but the downturn makes smaller businesses vulnerable to takeovers and shutdowns.

Didar Bekbaouov, a Kazakh miner and co-founder of mining firm Xive, stated that he was ""adjusting to new prices and reality"" and had shut down non-profitable mining operations once bitcoin fell below $25,000. 

Companies that have previously sought capital from banks or markets are now finding it more difficult; equity markets have fallen, and appetite for fundraising has waned, while interest rates have risen. 

Others may be forced to close their doors or abandon plans to purchase more computers as a result. ""In some cases, people have begun to cancel orders due to capital constraints and margin compression,"" Schumacher explained.

""Companies that have been thoughtfully planning for the downturn for some time are likely to weather this period,"" said Jaime Leverton, chief executive of Canadian-listed Hut 8. ""However, many have acted with impulse at the peak of the market, and may be stretched and underfunded in the coming months."" 

He claimed Hut8 had been preparing for a price drop for a year and had amassed a stash of 7,078 ""unencumbered bitcoin"" that it could use for acquisitions. 

The ""first wave"" of takeover deals, according to Peter Wall, CEO of UK-listed Argo Blockchain, is expected within a year.",25,bitcoinmining,2022-06-16 18:35:02

vdurob,luka_96,0,https://redd.it/vdurob,None,Antminer S9 fine control of power / hash rate. Dynamically disconnecting hashboards etc...,"Hello all,

Is there a way to dynamically tell Antminer s9 to change power consumption (clock rate, hash rate) for example every 30min or an hour so no reboots, just some command to the API, and boom power goes from 1200w down to 400w with hopefully somewhat linear change in hash rate (in this eg. from 12 to 4TH)?

I hope you get the Idea it does not to be perfect obviously there is some power consumption for the control board and efficiency is changing when hash rate and temperatures change etc...

Everything is on the table. Custom binaries, patching firmware, or custom firmware like braiins os but it needs to be FOSS...

Hardware modifications are also possible for me. I was thinking to make some relay/MOSFETs circuits to disconnect hashing board control wires or if needed even power wires. But I don't know how would Antminer react to that? So in that way I get full power, 2/3 and 1/3 power which is good but even better would be to control it with software so I can have more discrete power steps for eg. 100w steps with let's say min of 300w in steps by 100w up to max.

Bitmain, however, has released the latest model of Hyd miner at this time, why is this?

Because when the price of bitcoin is high, traditional air-cooled miners can bring you enough revenue that most people don't choose to upgrade their miners at this time.

And when the bitcoin price drops dramatically, most miners are ready to power down and shut down, in which case only miners with 100TH or more can afford to keep running.

By low price Hyd miners open up new markets when the market is falling, when the bitcoin price goes back up again, bitmain's miners will occupy more than 90% of the share of miners and other producers won't have any ability to compete with bitmain anymore.

So will you choose to buy bitmain's Hyd miner?",0,bitcoinmining,2022-06-17 04:31:52

Generally, Crypto mining has been known to cause environmental dilemmas through its mining operations, and Bitcoin mining reaches new levels of concern due to its proof of work (POW) model which consumes a large amount of energy while still emitting harmful carbon into the environment. 

As a result, due to the negative impact of mining operations, Bitcoin mining companies now approve carbon neutrality with new mining regulations put in place for the support of a more eco-friendly environment. 

Furthermore, several cryptocurrencies like Bitgreen, Exeno, Ethereum and others are actively taking on eco-friendly projects to make the environment healthier while still being a profitable blockchain and advancing the crypto sector with world benefiting technological developments. 

As Ethereum transitions from a proof of work to a proof of stake model, it allows lesser energy consumption and almost zero carbon emission, while Exeno crypto online global store actively participates in eco-friendly projects and charity campaigns and ensures safe crypto transactions as you purchase products and merchandise on its platform. 

According to Cointelegraph, current crypto mining regulations ensure compliance which environmental social, and governance factors, and the Kazakhstan republic now also promotes a more environmentally friendly crypto mining operation by proposing more regulations for crypto mining operators to report on their electricity consumption and technical specifications.

Hi all, I'd like to take a second to review Bolt Mining which is a company I found out about on reddit, but has somewhat polarizing reviews on here. There is not a lot of information on many of these crypto companies and when I was trying to research hosting with Bolt Mining, it was really just a shot in the dark whether it was going to work or not. I had my L7 basically collecting dust, as many of the hosting companies I was working with had limited capacity/resources etc and honestly I was pretty desperate to get it setup somewhere. In a nutshell, these guys had my L7 miner delivered on Saturday and it was setup and mining by EOD Tuesday which is ridiculously fast compared to most crypto companies I have used. I have been mining nonstop with no issues besides very small dropouts. I have only purchased hosting from them but the experience was so seamless that I'm definitely considering purchasing ASIC's directly from them in the future. I also got to tour their facility/meet with their co-founder Sean and was overall very impressed with what they have built here in Texas. Additionally, the support they have is incredible and VERY responsive compared to other companies.

Obviously, there are loads of fake accounts on reddit and it's super hard to trust ANY reviews on any of these companies which is why I'm doing this review. This is a brand new company and I had seen both good and bad reviews but not very much information. And the post that was slamming them was a guy who didn't even end up like finishing a transaction with them at all which is frustrating to me who is actually trying to find legitimate business. I'm pretty new to mining but I own 5 machines currently, and I have been in business with various companies in this industry (Compass mining, goldshell etc.) Bolt Mining and Goldshell are definitely two of my highest rated companies I have worked with so far.

Smaller miners are getting out of their ""garages"" and sending their machines to hosting companies because it is no longer profitable to run them in a ""garage"".

But if the bitcoin price continues to fall, more large farms will move to South America and Canada, and there is already a trend, with some Canadian hosting companies taking advantage of the opportunity to rapidly expand their business and continue to buy miners, and the US may no longer be the place for miners.",1,bitcoinmining,2022-06-22 03:39:22

vi892s,resper8,6,https://redd.it/vi892s,None,Retiring GPU Miner Seeking Information on ASIC Hosting Services,"Good morning/afternoon/evening everyone,

This is my first time posting here and am happy to have found this community. I‚Äôm hoping to get some insight on hosting services with potentially links to more details for my own research.

I‚Äôm currently a GPU miner who has decided to sell off ~80% of my hardware due to the uncertainty regarding the future of GPU mining over the next few months/years. I‚Äôm working to get rid of the last bit of my equipment and put the proceeds into purchasing some Bitcoin ASICs. 

Unfortunately, due to my electricity costs in my state (WV), it will be very difficult to make any type of profit, seeing as I pay 0.15c/kWh.

Because of this, I‚Äôm seeking information on reputable and cost-efficient hosting services. I‚Äôve not read great things regarding Compass Mining, for example, but have read good things about Musk Miners and their new use of flare gas for powering their operations. Sadly, I wouldn‚Äôt be able to afford their MOQ of 5 units to qualify for hosting.

Would any of you all happen to have any recommendations for hosting services, without a MOQ, and with the potential of purchasing my equipment outside of their services? 

Any information would be helpful. Thank you.",1,bitcoinmining,2022-06-22 15:45:48

(Excuse my language) I don't want to do anything to damage the miners EVER but we used to run things like L3s and S9 on their sides safely. Could we do the same thing with next generation miners like the E3 and iPollo (I forget which is the tall one)? Safety is my primary concern here. I know computers can be run as desktop or tower.

vid0tf,JMMiningBitcoin,8,https://redd.it/vid0tf,None,Trying to buy parts from Whatsminer,"I have never used crypto, only/except BTC. I have the required amount in USDC in Gemini. 

The situation: Whatsminer support operates through Telegram, and I am trying to order some small components for fixing/ repairing machines. I am in touch with whatsminercici, she handles parts orders. She provided me with the parts list, and I submitted an order. 

She sent me an address, accompanied by a QR code. I opened Gemini, and tried to ‚Äúwithdraw‚Äù the funds to the given address. Instead of going through as one would hope, it gave me an error. ‚ÄúInvalid network address‚Äù. 

I tried to bring this to the representative‚Äôs attention, but she just verified the address on her end and sends it to me again. I think the language gap is preventing her from understanding my issue. 

Do I need to use a different service than Gemini? I‚Äôm having trouble understanding why the address is invalid. Surely Whatsminer wouldn‚Äôt send an inactive address with an accompanying QR code, multiple times. 

It is very frustrating that Microbt and Whatsminer operate solely on telegram, when it concerns customer service. I only receive replies to my questions late at night (understable), and the replies do not address my questions. 

Can anyone shed some light on my situation? I don‚Äôt understand why this is so hard for me, so I‚Äôm sorry if this comes off as extremely amateur. Also, I am not concerned with the integrity of the transaction. All signs point that I am in the right place, I just can‚Äôt complete the purchase!

vk3mrr,Ahappierplanet,0,https://redd.it/vk3mrr,None,Comparing Apples to Oranges,"Mining proponents argue that BC mining does not consume more energy than many other industries, such as traditional banking, other data centers, and even  washing machines and Christmas lights. However, it should be  noted 1) energy consumption must decrease there too, those industries  aren‚Äôt repowering fossil fuel plants, and energy efficiency standards  are critical and 2) more people rely on those goods than cryptocurrency.  The consumption of energy needed to validate cryptocurrencies does not line up with the number of people using that  good.  

Also, comparing BC mining to banking/credit card transactions is like comparing apples to oranges.  The credit card network processes more than 10,000 transactions per second. Bitcoin can handle 3-7 transactions per second. 

What percentage of BC's drop has to do with the bad energy PR?

The demand was huge when BTC was at all-time-highs and prices for rigs were also at all-time-highs... What are your opinions on mining today?

S19's used to be going for $15k. Now they're around $6k. Sure they aren't as ""profitable"" because BTC is down right now... but the only reasons I can think that people (who at least understand what Bitcoin is and why it is important) aren't jumping on this opportunity are:  


1. Not looking to the long term. They see that BTC is down and an S19 isn't making $40+ per day right now and just aren't interested.
2. Not enough funds to buy the equipment. Maybe they had all their assets tied up in BTC and now that it is down (and we're headed towards recession) they just aren't looking to get into mining? $6k is definitely still a lot of money to most people.
3. Power cost concerns. Maybe they're worried that electricity rates are going to skyrocket soon and mining will no longer be even close to profitable?
4. They don't want to deal with the heat and noise? Maybe they don't know about hosting or don't trust hosting?

A lot of things changed and here is the quick update:

Compass had a huge fuck up in Russia. When the war started back in February many customers got nervous if the machines should be moved out of Russia. I felt the same. But Compass and Whit Gibbs (CEO) kept convincing  customers that Compass has everything under control. Contingencies are in place. Do not worry!

March 3, 2022 - business as usual

Fast forward few months and this is the update from June 22:

&#x200B;

After this Compass completely deleted their Discord, because they didn't want to see customer complaining. Customer complaints are bad for sales. 

The even worse is that the miners at Bitriver could be easily moved to a different location. But Compass just abandoned our miners over there. Bitriver is not talking to individual customers because they do recognize only Compass as the party of the contract. Compass cancelled the contract with Bitriver and left miners over there.

Compass doesn't even want customers to talk to Bitriver. And many customers are from countries which are not affected by OFAC sanctions. Compass will not talk to Bitriver but you as a customer don't you dare to talk to them too! Millions of dollars of equipment was left to the Russian counterparty to mine instead of getting them out of the sanctioned Russian facility out to a secured storage.

BTW this is a response you get from Bitriver if you try to contact them and get your miners sold or transferred somewhere else:

Compass is taking zero responsibility and hopes that if they offer low enough offers that people will start again buying their miners and just write off the ones in Russia.

**Hosting renewals:**

I started mining last year when hosting rates ware 6.1c, 6.3c and now they all go up to 7.5c. If your miner is in Canada it might be hard to get it to U.S. (due to the tariffs and customs duty). Some of the miners I have with Compass are not profitable anymore and hosting rate was just increased. I do not believe the hosting rates is increased due to the facility increase, but because Compass just wants to increase the profit margin.

**Compass is getting kicked out of facilities**

They are very good in suppressing it, but they are getting kicked out of different facilities. The outcome for customers is being offline for several months without any compensation (except not paying for hosting). Last year it was Ohio, Kentucky. This year Oklahoma.  


Site owner & site operator issue.

**Deployments**

The other business at Compass is as usual. New deployments are behind schedule, miners are offline very often, new hosting centers are pretty unstable... writing tickets with miners offline is becoming a full time job. Everyday there are miners offline, but support just reboots miners and writes how it got resolved.

This order has 10 miners. I barely get them online. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/lb60b2tqzz791.png?width=1124&format=png&auto=webp&s=720c111260941d10e4b5c90131b5d1551d6c46b5

Every day I write a ticket that miners are offline and get this back:

*Thank you for bringing this to our attention. Great News! I am happy to confirm your worker is online and hashing optimally.*

The next day the same. Basically the new facilities are built in very fast way. The cooling is not done right and instead of sorting the cause of the issues they just keep rebooting and postponing any permanent resolution.  Many facilities now curtail power but the hosting charge remains the same. Imagine if your miners are down several hours each day, but you still pay full hosting rate. This is another way how to increase profit margins in an unethical way.

2. Structure - single car garage uninsulated

4. Electrical upgrades - 200A service panel with 6x dedicated 20A 240V and 4x dedicated 20A 120v and1x dedicated 30A 240V circuit with PDU attached (10AWG for the 30A and 12AWG for the 20A)
5. Equipment - currently running only on 4x 20A 120V and 1x 20A 240V a total of 48 GPUs (another 40available provided I get good news from the group) on the 20A 240V I have 2x 2000w PSUs (slightlyover the 80% but not too far over)
6. Solar system - (this was my big mistake, so I may just bypass the system completely depending onwhat information I get from the group.) 21x 380w SilFab panels + Generac Inverter and M6 Batterybackup.
7. Ventilation - (these are not installed yet but they are on the way.) 2x 12"" / 16"" / 18"" shutter exhaustfans.  My thought here is to install active cooling in the attic and then vent up to attic using dryerduct or similar. Building enclosures for mining rigs where cold air from the mini split in the garageis sucked into the enclosures by the sets or 5400RPM 120MM 12v fans and then another set pushesthe hot air up through the ducts into the attic. Gonna start with a 12"" on each end setup inpush/pull and if that's not enough then I will widen the hole and try it with 16"" and finally 18"" fans.Hopefully that will suffice or I may have to double down on the gable fans.

Now that all that is out of the way my questions are:

vnnlup,WhiteDogNC,0,https://redd.it/vnnlup,None,CPI vs PCE: A tale of FUD ruling the economy that is affecting BTC price and miner equipment.,"The chart shows the widening gap between the CPI measure of inflation (an index that shows what consumers ‚Äúfeel‚Äù and react to; gas, residential rent, food, utilities, etc..) versus the PCE measure of inflation (index that gives low weight to gas and rent; the Fed watches this one as it is an indicator of economy and business)

This gap barely widens under normal conditions.  Right now we have a 2% spread, something not seen since 1980.  

What does that mean though???

Consumers will be feeling the inflationary pinch much harder during this wide gap, and what happens when consumers and political constituents feel inflationary pressure?  They bitch.  And they make an excellent audience for the AP wire, Reuters, and the main stream media which will feed their fears and gain their clicks (revenue).  The general consensus by ‚Äúnormal people‚Äù will be that inflation is worse, lasting longer, and the reason that they can‚Äôt _____ (fill in the blank with any insipid complaint made by the lazy and unmotivated) because when the inflationary data states a recovery is upon us, they will say it is ‚Äúbullshit‚Äù they can‚Äôt trust. 

But stable businesses with solid fundamentals don‚Äôt give a crap about how stuff ‚Äúfeels‚Äù, they care about the numbers and bottom line.  

Exactly like in the early 80‚Äôs we will see a subtle change in profitability that will help businesses, and also help the general population, but humans love to complain and the FUD will be spread as hard as possible.  Feel good stories don‚Äôt make money, panic and schadenfreude does!

The lesson is to watch the data, not the train wreck of culling the weak during a bear market (which we can‚Äôt even technically call our current situation until we have final numbers from June and July showing a decline).

For Xilinx 7007 Boards I tried [hive.farm](https://hive.farm) & [asic.to](https://asic.to) & [braiins.com](https://braiins.com)

vts5ef,FinancialElderberry9,11,https://redd.it/vts5ef,None,Medium/Large BTC Mining Facility Networking,"Hello all,

I have working in general IT services for 15 years, the past 10 as a network engineer. Over the past year and a half, one of my biggest clients has been a bitcoin mine. This particular mine, which is geographically close to where I live, had just been purchased from a now defunct mining company by a private entrepreneur. He hired an acquaintance of mine to do facility management. This acquaintance realized he was in over his head in the networking department pretty quickly, and asked to bring me in. When I started to do work for them, the facility had about 3,000 miners total and the network was in complete disarray, at any given time they had 10-25% of their miners offline due to networking issues.

&#x200B;

Since then I have helped them expand to about 15,000 active miners and cleaned up their original infrastructure so there is rarely more than 0.5% of miners offline due to network issues. All of the new networking infrastructure for the additional 12,000 or so miners was designed and implemented by me, with a little help here and there from some co-workers when it was crunch time.

&#x200B;

During my time working for this mine, what I have found is there are many things specific to bitcoin mines that do not translate well from normal enterprise or data center network engineering experience. Pulling just a regular IT operations or network engineer of the street won't fix your problems immediately, it will take time to work out the particulars for bitcoin mines. I found this out the hard way, but stuck with it and now am very confident in my skills as a bitcoin mining networking specialist.

&#x200B;

With all of that said, is there a good website or forum to go to for companies looking for contractors with mining specific experience? I feel with my expertise and experience I can help other mines and colocations with their networking issues or if there are new facilities in the works, designing and implementing the networking side. If anyone has any thoughts on this, or is actively looking for some networking help, please drop me a DM.",2,bitcoinmining,2022-07-07 20:26:00

(A S9 is profitable),"I   live in a country where electricity is free (literally) a house with a   1,000kWH/month power consumption will pay like 1 USD for 3 months of   service.

But, having high power   consumption (I think something that draws more than 1,000 W 24/7 per   place) could put you under the radar, even when using power and mining   technically is not illegal, here you can go to jail or get mugged,   robbed or victim of ransom for even less (I mean by the   police/government). They say you have to register as miner with them,   but even doing that some people is ‚Äúhunted‚Äù and I don‚Äôt know what is   worse, because registering you will be in a database with your MH/GH/TH,   location and so on.

I always  have  liked PC and building them, that I why I like so much GPU mining. I   have some experience with a 1660S and trying to configure machines for   wealthy people I know (even doing this is risky, because they can  ‚Äúsell‚Äù  you), with ASIC no experience.

I   don‚Äôt know if there is a ASIC with a power consumption under 1,000W  that  is as versatile as a GPU (I mean with other coins, considering the   merge).

Of course, there comes  the  first problem. I don‚Äôt have money, sadly here monthly minimum wage  is  very low (under 30 USD monthly) and a ‚Äúgood‚Äù wage is like 500 USD   monthly.

What is your opinion? What could I do (If there is something I can)? Every day I feel not using that electricity is a waste.

I   was thinking talking to some friends (with money) and configuring them   the rig in their place or mine (I have like 2-3 places, so 3,000W) and   taking a cut? 15%? Selling my knowledge to design and config rigs?

The   1,000W value is something I put myself, I know people mining at home   with old S9 that draw over 2,000W and haven‚Äôt had any problems (Only   country where a S9 is profitable)

My dream would be a rig with maybe 6 RTX3070 or a low power ASIC (BTC or ETH, I don‚Äôt know, here ANYTHING is profitable).

Problem:   Blackouts are common (in my places like 4-8h weekly), internet is not   reliable (maybe 2-4h weekly not working) and heat (lowest temperature   here is like 25C at night in December hehehe), anyway without problem   with electricity an AC is totally possible.",2,bitcoinmining,2022-07-10 18:30:29

vycgek,OutlandishnessBoth93,4,https://redd.it/vycgek,None,How bitcoin mining Can help develop a Country,"Hi :) , basically I would like to share some reasoning about how one of the activities derived from Cryptocurrencies can become one of the main economic activities of a country. And speed up their growth. Taking into account that it is a developing country. 

***PARAGUAY***

Paraguay is a country that could be a very competitive option for crypto mining. 

Considering that it has all the conditions to become a Crypto mining hub.

&#x200B;

 \# Little info about Paraguay

Paraguay is a landlocked country located in central South America. It shares borders with Brazil, Argentina, and Bolivia.

* Population: 7,453,695 (2022) 
* Area: 406,752 km2 / 157047.825 sq mi
* Official languages: Spanish/Guarani
* Currency: Guarani
* Average Annual Temperature: 20-25 ¬∞C / 68¬∞F - 77¬∞F

\# Why Paraguay?

Paraguay obtains essentially all of its electricity from renewable sources, 100% from hydroelectricity. 

* 88% Central Hidroel√©ctrica Itaipu (Itaipu Dam's hydroelectric power plant produced the second most electricity of any in the world) In 2021, the Itaipu plant has reached the production of 663369 Gigawatt-hours (GWh), accumulating 2,830,952 GWh.
* 9% Yacyreta Hydroelectric Power Plant
* 3% Acaray Hydroelectric Power Plant

It has a state-owned power plant operator (ANDE) which is responsible for the transmission and distribution of energy.

***Cost of electricity USD 0.06 Kw/h***, with the possibility of negotiating prices according to consumption.

Stable financial system.

It already has tax and legal regulations in the area of cryptocurrency mining. Considering that there is already large-scale mining(but not enough).

 It has the necessary suppliers to start mining projects of all kinds. Electrical materials, materials for the datacenters, and materials for the adaptation of the farms so that the appropriate mining conditions are met. 

&#x200B;

\# How could it help the country?

It could help to grow the market by opening a new economic activity.

It could help to train the population in the area of technology and in all the areas involved in mining.

It would generate a source of jobs and skilled labor.

It would help the industrialization of the country, which would help the negotiation of the use of 50% of Itaipu with Brazil.

It would help the dynamization of the economy since it would promote the growth of all the economic activities underlying mining.

&#x200B;

Obviously, this is just a glimpse of the possibilities, but I think it serves to keep in mind one option.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

vzco8i,immrgolden1995,52,https://redd.it/vzco8i,None,Big Loan - Big Loss," 

I took out a loan to buy 10 Antminer S19 J Pro 104 TH back in January. The total loan amount was $130k which was used to pay hosting fees and setup as well. Roughly $120/TH.

It's looking pretty bad right now. The value of the rigs are now at about $25/TH. I could have bought 48 rigs at the current prices that I paid for 10 rigs in January. The cash flow is nowhere near even my worst case calculations at the time of purchase.

Does anyone see any light at the end of the tunnel here, or was this just a bad investment at a bad time? Sometimes that's what it's like investing in risky spaces, but all I can hope is BTC skyrockets towards the halving.",22,bitcoinmining,2022-07-15 01:58:23

The latest research from blockchain analytics firm, Arcane Research, shows that public miners sold nearly 400% of their Bitcoin (BTC) production in June 2022.  

According to CoinQuora, from January to April this year, they only sold 20% to 40% of their production, keeping up with their hodl-at-any-cost strategy. The dynamics, however, changed as BTC fell from $40,000 to $30,000 in May. In June, miners liquidated 14,600 bitcoin, over $300 million, representing nearly four times their total production of 3,900 BTC.

The report pointed to Core Scientific and Bitfarms as the mining firms with the largest liquidation share. Core Scientific dumped almost 10,000 bitcoin, having only 1,959 BTC left. Bitfarms sold 3,353 BTC. On the other hand, Northern Data cleared the entirety of its BTC and Ethereum (ETH) holdings in May and June and rumored they hold some other blockchain tokens like AVAX, CCD and SOL.",5,bitcoinmining,2022-07-17 19:02:10

Hope everyone's safe who's experiencing some crazy heatwaves around the world!

We're a hosted mining company (Bit49) that's looking to further increase our miner capacity at our sites in the US, as well as pushing to use as much renewable energy where possible (We have a really cool digital product in the works regarding renewable timestamps too).

I recently posted availability at our Glencoe, MN facility which has now been filled.

**You can jump on our waitlist here to be notified when we have space:** [**https://bit49.io/waitlist/**](https://bit49.io/waitlist/)

**Our Offering:**

* **Simplified Pricing**
* **Guaranteed Spacing (MOQ of 5 machines)**
* **Service Automation**
* **Customer Dashboard**
* **Service-level Transparency**
* **Site Tour & Site Footage**

Bit49 has been operating in the space since 2018 and we've generally been mostly B2B. Now, we're pushing an additional service to retail miners as we believe we can provide the trust, transparency, honesty, and service level that this space needs!   


Especially after the crazy months that many witnessed and were sadly caught up in. It also helps that we're Bitmains best technician certifier too, although I do love me a good M series.

Ps. We're working on rebranding our website ( I know, it looks a little meh) + working on providing as much educational content with blogs, podcasts, and investor reports as we can.

w4njgq,QR3124,15,https://redd.it/w4njgq,None,Newb considering single BTC miner in basement.,"I am considering investing in a [Bitmain Antminer S19 XP (140Th)](https://www.asicminervalue.com/miners/bitmain/antminer-s19-xp-140th), that currently shows barely a profitable setup but of course that depends upon kwh price. Nicehash shows using an older Bitmain Antminer S19 Pro at .23 per kwh (the rate in my state) results in a loss of about $213 USD a month. 

The newer machine is a bit more efficient, but i'd still be losing about $109 a month on electricity costs. 

Then there's the cost of the machine, at about $9,000 (pre-order prices). 

I've got a decent sized basement that runs cool even in the summer so heat wouldn't be a problem for me. 

Of course it's gambling that the price if BTC will appreciate in the coming years, but what I'm wondering is if buying just one machine and joining a pool is ever going to yield anything even in a bull market.

Rep: We'd love to host miners for you. Our ASICS start off at $xxxx.xx and the all in kwh charge is .xxcents.

Me: that's greats, I have a few S19's right that I'd like to host.  Not looking to purchase any at the moment. Is that something that you can do?

Rep: *crickets*........

It's something that needs to be acknowledged.  There is a bunch of people out there who bought several ASICS during the bull run and just need somewhere to break even or profitably host. These colocations that are trying to sell Asics just want to offload their overhead and get customers into contracts.  There is a real demand for single Asic hosting. Plus, a lot of energy companies will offer a lower rate once you reach a certain demand, which these individual miners could help a developing colocation meet that demand. I just might have to open a colocation myself to get the cheaper rates.",15,bitcoinmining,2022-07-21 18:40:08

If you were to look for a hosting provider would it matter how many machines they're currently hosting? Or what their max capacity is?  


At the moment I've got   


* Do they have real people you can talk to (not just a company email)?
* Have they been in business for at least two years? (is this necessary?)
* Are they a legal entity?
* You can visit their mining sites in person
* You can see their pricing list with all added fees
* You can pay via Credit card, Debit card, ACH, Bitcoin, other coins/tokens
* They host X or more miners at a time   
(what would be the minimum number you'd be confident to host with them?) 
* A maximum capacity of X or more. (what would be the minimum max capacity that you'd be confident to host with them?)
* Average uptime of 95% or more.

*E.g., FTX, Coinbase, Gemini, Kraken, Binance, and others*

>Cryptocurrency exchanges are businesses specifically focused on facilitating the purchase, sale, and custody of cryptocurrencies. Exchanges typically offer both novice-friendly and expert-ready interfaces. Most make a wide variety of cryptocurrency trading pairs available‚Äîwith all offering bitcoin.

Mining pools

*E.g., f2pool, 2miners, and others*

>Mining is the process of finding blocks on Proof-of-Work networks (such as Bitcoin and Ethereum) and getting the block rewards. The mining process can be regarded as the process of solving mathematical problems. The first one who provides a valid answer will receive rewards.  
A mining pool is a mining technology service platform. In this way, miners can obtain stable mining rewards by connecting mining machines to pools for mining.

Bitcoin by proxy

*E.g., GBTC and others*

>Bitcoin can be purchased by proxy through financial products such as trusts, derivatives, and exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Share prices in these entities can sometimes be bought at a discount or a premium depending on market conditions.

w9z6bh,Icy_Hovercraft_7050,14,https://redd.it/w9z6bh,None,BITMAIN SUPPORT/ WARRANTY,"BITMAIN SUPPORT/ WARRANTY IS GARBAGE. I returned my s19 pro for the 2nd warranty repair in about 6 months. After weeks of going back and forth with support repeating the same instructions on the website for problem shooting, providing the wrong firmware to update, repeated times, without success they told me to return the miner to the DE/USA repair facility. The return remained ""uncollected"" for about a week after it was delivered. About 3 weeks after returning the miner I received an email saying that it was completed and the FedEx return label was created. That was 1 week ago and FedEx has not received package. After several requests to support, they are now saying that there is no tracking info after Bitmain ""shipped"" the miner. There is nothing anywhere that says the miner was shipped, only that a label was created. Support keeps repeating that the miner was ""shipped"" but there is no tracking info. Presumably, this is because the terms of the warranty state that loss after delivering to the carrier are not Bitmains responsibility. Support says they will check with FedEx and let me know and that this could take 1-3 weeks. I can contact FedEx but this is completely pointless. Fedex never received the package. This warranty return has taken over 2 months and counting, and it appears that BITMAIN has lost the miner and is attempting to avoid responsibility. These are the responses from customer ‚Äúsupport‚Äù

Fast forward through the price crash of mid June and Will reached out to check in with me. My team had been re-working the numbers throughout the price crash and when Will called we were ready to start making purchases. I spent some time with Will and his team on a call and based on the confidence they instilled in us, we moved forward with our first purchase. We received an invoice and a purchase agreement from Will within the hour. We sent out the payment on July 19th and today we received our miners. All the boxes appear in good condition and the one unit I have taken out of the box looks mint fresh.

wbrxf6,WhiteDogNC,20,https://redd.it/wbrxf6,None,Why ROI is a misplaced concept for purchasing an ASIC miner.,"ROI is a misnomer and an incorrect way to decide when to buy an ASIC miner.  Return On Investment is a calculation done after the return is gained; a Bitcoin ASIC miner has a different return every hour, day, week.  And if you don‚Äôt ruin your miner, you can mine for years and still resell them.  What if you don‚Äôt cash in your Bitcoin daily and hold it for future value‚Ä¶.?  Most agree BTC will rise again.  

A better way is to look at it‚Äôs coin output and how much you have to pay for your specific electricity cost.  A 100TH BTC miner will output approx 0.0005 BTC per 24 hours (and yes, I average just above that per 100TH because I‚Äôm smarter than the dumb calculators online - PPLNS average, using firmware that gives bonus).  

Hash for 200 days and you‚Äôd have 0.10 BTC and a miner still in warranty.  Your ‚Äúinvestment‚Äù when buying a miner doesn‚Äôt just disappear into smoke, it retains value as long as BTC doesn‚Äôt go to zero.  (BTC at zero is insane)

Better yet, 400 days mining would get approx 0.20 BTC and still have a decent miner.  That would be Sept 1, 2023 and my bet is BTC >$60K by then.  Which makes your 400 day journey a $12,000 return on investment and a 100TH miner will sell for $5,000+ even as used.  (When BTC price rises, so does the cost of the miner - just ask the S9 and L3 on their last 6-7 years)

The only way to get an accurate ROI on a miner purchase is to wait until you have stacked coins, sold them for fiat, sold your miner, deduct out your electric cost and see what is left.  

Mining is not such a simple closed end loop.  It‚Äôs not for a fast buck.  It requires patience and time.  But the long term view, with an assumption that BTC will rise, means someone hashing a miner for greater than 400 days will have more profit than if they simply bought on an exchange.",8,bitcoinmining,2022-07-30 07:39:20

I hate to say it but I am almost desperate.

I have to admit I was almost fooled once (it was believable because the person whose account was hacked worked at a Cash for Gold place, and it seemed adjacent to me) but I caught them redhanded when I saw the same wording another friend's account.

I know scams are a big problem in the mining community, but is there a way to join a mining pool as a completely novice who does not own mining equipment without risking getting involved in or helping perpetuate the scams?

Here is a little bit of highlights from Mining Disrupt week in Miami and what is fun there. We are not affiliated with any of the companies mentioned below, nor have received commissioned to promote any of those. Just sharing what seemed interesting.

&#x200B;

1. Definitely the biggest surprise. ePIC Blockchain Technology's ""intel chip"" machine. The machine have a super futuristic look to it (it is really cool!!). The machines are using hydro cooling and have an efficiency rating for 26 J/T at top efficiency setting (S19jPro is at 29.5, the lower the better for the number). They are currently building a solution for Argo, but is open to set things up for other operations too.
2. Ant Alpha: Bitmain's financing platform for machine purchase. Which allow users to take a loan for purchasing machines from Bitmain (look at this it is incredibly smart). 
3. A lot of our friends are there (Compass, Wattum, ASIC Jungle), as well as a lot of hosting companies and resellers.
4. Bitmain is going in strong with their promotion on Hydro + container combo. With extremely high efficiency.
5. Even outside of Bitmain's official hydro system, there are a bunch of other solution providers on either immersion cooling or hydro cooling (directly cooling the hashboard) set ups available for exhibition.
6. Blockforge had a GIANT S9 miner displayed outside of the conference, which is pretty cool. Along with Uminer's and ASIC Jungle's Lambo (you can't be Bitcoin without the lambo you know)
7. KuCoin (the exchange) is launching their mining pool and doing a low-fee promotion right now.
8. We are currently formulating our partnership with utility provider to bring more valuable land assets to our community.

The Bitcoin network difficulty decreased by 5.01%, the third consecutive drop since late June. Following a coin price recovery and lessened hashrate competition, the mining revenue has returned to $0.1035 per 1 TH/s, compared to $0.09 three weeks ago.

The first time I tried using the miner, I had to stop mining after about 15 mins due to the heat generated in the room despite having a big standing fan to regulate it.
My question is, is there a specific type of fan I can use to regulate the heat? Instead, what‚Äôs your best suggestion to deal with the heat? (I cannot do much on walls or make holes )",1,bitcoinmining,2022-08-05 19:11:49
wh7p6a,Got_electric,0,https://redd.it/wh7p6a,None,Power Supply Management,"At ARC Power, we know you want to be the Most Innovative & Profitable Mining Company in North America. To do that you need a reliable and manageable low-cost power supply.  

The problem is the difficulty of finding affordable power, without the extra headache of trying to manage multiple sites, in multiple states, under multiple power purchase agreements. 

Frankly, it can be exhausting trying to manage power supply while trying to manage the rapid growth and development in this industry. 

We believe in managing your bottom line; power supply expenses, so you can manage your top line; profits. We understand the struggle working with power generation resources, transmission resources, and distribution companies to determine if a site is sufficient for your needs. 

We understand because we operate all three types of resources ourselves, and additionally an energy trading desk to manage large multi-state, multi-facility power supply purchases. 

Here‚Äôs how we do it: 1) We enter into a non-disclosure agreement with you and learn about your goals and needs; 2) We determine the best place to start helping you manage your power supply; 3) We provide you indicative pricing on power purchase agreements at favorable locations for your review and acceptance. 

So, review, sign, and return our retainer agreement. In the meantime, you can gather all your power purchase agreements together for us to review and begin managing on your behalf. 

So, you can stop power purchasing and management headaches, and instead start reporting higher profits.

I've built, changed, tried to rebuild this half a dozen times and still do not have it to where I want. I think the most annoying part is I don't think I'm that great with excel -- so I'm probably using formulas very inefficiently and trying to change one thing forces me to need to change several things. Here is what I have so far:

&#x200B;

[calc](https://preview.redd.it/8eigw539myg91.jpg?width=1773&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8480ce649fa397cb3983d5b66c455f090d68e543)

&#x200B;

Here is the list of items you can change :

1. Miners
2. Quantity
3. $ / kWh
4. Pool Fee
5. Difficulty Increase %
6. BTC price increase %
7. Immersion Mining % Hashrate Increase
8. (ETH Price) -- this is mostly unrelated to this screenshot, but I put it in here for something further down on the page to help with calculating ETH 2.0 Staking.

\^ For the most part -- these are all just vlookups tied to a separate sheet with the data coming in over API. All of the calculations I'm doing are (I'm sure) not very efficient. For example:

1. I'm taking the network difficulty and  \*2\^32/600/1000000000000 (to get it to TH/s)
2. then separately calculating what my hash rate share would be
3. then using that to determine # of BTC / day in another separate calculation
4. then converting that into USD

If anyone has a formula to help nest all of that together that would be super helpful !

&#x200B;

**Couple of areas I could use help with thinking through how to add:**

1. Transaction fees -- I'm not as concerned with this because if I can hit a quick break even without calculating that -- it's just a bonus. But what's a good way to try to calculate transaction fees into this?
2. HODL ratio -- have not figure out the best way to add this. Essentially meaning how many Bitcoins do you sell vs hold over a specific time period.

wlv3wh,hartwog,16,https://redd.it/wlv3wh,None,208/120 vs 415/240 vs 480/277," Current setup is 400amp 208v. Located in the Midwest USA. My utility company will upgrade and swap out my roadside transformer for free. My utility company will only provide 208 or 480. They will not provide 415 from the road. My service line can handle up to 1200amp.  I currently use 100kw GPUs and ASICs, with a wide range of PSU's. 

 I'm looking at my next upgrade. I'm curious what other's opinions are.   

# Option 1. 

1200amp 208/120 - This gets me \~ 345kw usable. 

Pros: This wouldn't require me to purchase any additional dry transformers for my building. I could use ""off the shelf"" PDUs, PSUs, and all existing equipment. 

Cons: Limited kw available. 

# Option 2. 

1200amp 415/240 - This gets me \~ 690 kw usable. This would require the Utility company to provide 480/277 from the road.

Pros: I could still use ""off the shelf"" existing PSUs. Significantly more KW available. 

Cons: I would have to purchase a dry transformer to step down to 415/240. I would also have to purchase a smaller transformer to step down to 208/120 to run my lights and other small stuff. Longer lead time on the dry transformers. Additional cost investment. I would have to get new PDUs that gave power Line-Neutral. 

# Option 3. 

1200amp 480/277 - This gets me \~ 790 kw usable. 

Pros: No additional dry transformer is required to run the mining gear. This gets me the most Kw usable. 

Cons: I would have to swap out all of my existing PSU's for ones that are rated for 277v. Most likely Alphaminer APW3 equivalent with additional 8 pin wires for my GPUs and then upgraded S19 PSUs. It would also require new PDUs that give power Line-Neutral. I would have to purchase a small dry transformer to run my lights and other small items.",3,bitcoinmining,2022-08-11 16:05:52

Now my issue is that it won't connect to the pool again. I tried multiple pool settings, I tried disconnecting all but one of the hashboards. then I switched the one hashboard that i had plugged in. Nothing seemed to work.

I bought a location in the north of Norway before the summer, after the electricity price in my original place made the operation unprofitable. 

I have explored the option of having the machines collocated, but since I bought the machines fairly close to the top I don't see it as a valid option if I ever want to break even in the future.

The location in the north has an electricity price today at 0,025 c pr kwh. with the spot price, or 0,045c kwh for a 5-year fixed rate.

the situation in regard to energy in Norway is mostly connected to political decisions and is complex, but with a fixed rate there is a hope to at least make some profit for all the work I have put down towards this endeavor this last year. 

the reason for me making this post is because the location has only 63A available on the trafo, I checked before buying it that it had at least 125A for me to continue my operation at least. but if I want to get the operation up and running there is some work that needs to be done in regards to upgrading the trafo and digging a new cable into the location. 

the opportunity I see for the right partner is to get your machines up and running and split the potential of hosting spaces (depending on the trafo upgrade and how much capital each of us has put into it) since the electricity rates are very competitive. North of Norway has a very good all-year temperature for mining also the safety is very good.

If there is someone who also has been looking at the option of colocation, but thinks the prices are too high for you to break even. Send me a DM so we can have a talk or meet.",4,bitcoinmining,2022-08-15 17:47:44

Fixed with Inflation Indexation: The price rises annually with inflation according to a publicly produced inflationary index as determined by the contract.

I built a review service for Bitcoin miner hosting companies in North America.

Check it out here - [https://hashbranch.com](https://hashbranch.com)

Right now, it's really difficult to find and compare all of the options for hosting your bitcoin miners. Most customers found their host through word of mouth, or through some random posts. This is not ideal. It's too confusing and frankly a little sketchy sometimes.

The goal is to provide a better selection and user experience for people that want to purchase miner hosting. A secondary effect is that this should make it cleaner for miner hosting business to get high quality leads for their services.

**What is it exactly?**

It is a searchable list of North American miner hosting businesses that highlights the important details of their offering.

We show things like:

* Customer reviews
* Minimum order quantity & minimum contract length
* Power rates
* Facility location
* Hosting options
* Fee structure
* Security information
* Cooling strategy

If you are a host, or you know of one we're missing on here, please let us know so we can get them listed. Same goes for any outdated or inaccurate information.

xddyrq,RegularSufficient132,3,https://redd.it/xddyrq,None,What is the best BTC wallet for mining?,"I have been looking online for a while for the most secure BTC wallet. 

it's pretty obvious that a hard wallet (physical) is the more secure soft wallet (online). 

so my go-to has to be a hard wallet and so far I landed on those :

Bitcoin core wallet, Trazor one and Trazor Model T

I eliminate (Ledger) from my go-to list because it got hacked back in July 2020... there were no private keys and Bitcoins lost but data of customers (names, emails, addresses/location) were compromised and that would put the owner/customer of Legder device at risk of (5$ wrench attack). that's why I'm also skeptical about Trazor one and Model T for the same reason, although both companies now are ensuring customers that they are taking their information secure, that still worries me a bit, and that is my first concern. 

My second is basically a seed phrase/recovery phrase whatever you wanna call it, seems riskier than the old fashion long and I'll explain, 

first of all how technically it works:

seed phrase generated BIP39 word list that extracted from the binary of your private key (WIF)

what's happening in the back-end of your wallet when you are trying to access your assets using the seed phrase is as follows 

\- you'll put 12 or 24 words and it promoted to people that they are random, but they are **NOT** 

there they are,I bet 1000$ that your seed phrase contains those ((((random))) 2048 words

github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0039/english.txt

\- For each word, there is the decimal number next to it presenting a portion of your private key in decimal format

\- after all 12 or 24 words are converted to decimals, now it converts them to binary format 

\- after that converts them to Hexdecimal, after that convert them to your WIF

there is a good video by this explain it visually for you to understand 

youtube.com/watch?v=oR5TwVxhNG4

so for me using Trazor and ledger seems not convenient enough for these two reasons

\- I don't want to get my ass kicked (5$ wrench attack) if the company that I got a hard wallet from data based got hacked 

\- I don't want to lose my hard-earned coins for treasure hunters brute forcing their way to my private key using Bip39 word list (2048) fuckin words.

&#x200B;

so i left with Bitcoin Core wallet, it has a lot of pros and cons 

&#x200B;

Pros : 

\- it is connected directly to bitcoin blockchain via peers connected to me 

\- I'll have full access to bitcoin wallet.dat and I move it to a secure drive (thinking of a way to encrypt a drive and have 0 knowledge of encrypting, still looking into that )

\- I can make transactions directly from Bitcoin core

\-  the original Bitcoin Core was created by **Satoshi Nakamoto** in late 2008 

Cons:

\- at this time we are at  v22.0.0, and got 0 ideas about the current Bitcoin core developers now, plus I'm worried about a bug pops-up in future updates and some hacker exploiting it, so far all is good.

\- every time I need to interact with bitcoin core I have to expose the wallet.dat, so it's a huge risk if I got hacked somehow, that's why I'm looking for encrypting that file, although it is encrypted by bitcoin core, I want to double encrypt that bastard 

&#x200B;

I sound extremely paranoid when it comes to bitcoin wallet, but I'm going for medium size mining facility, not a mining shed 

&#x200B;

The unit revenue has not increased, and the price has not increased significantly, but the computing power has continued to rise? People seem to desperately need 'newborns'

And also started to hear a lot of news about the early halving. According to the halving page provided by f2pool, there are 597 days left.

xe9i08,wattumofficial,2,https://redd.it/xe9i08,None,How To Capitalize Mining Bitcoin For a Year With A Bundle Of Antminer S19 Pro at $30 / TH?,"Mining Bitcoin with a lot of Antminer S19 models that costs $30 / TH will now take slightly more than 1 year to achieve ROI with free electricity or excluding the cost of electricity. With Bitcoin being traded currently at $20,200 USD as of 09/14/22, the industry standard right now for used Antminer S19 models of 100 TH or higher is currently $30 TH / TH across various mining providers including [Wattum](https://wattum.io/?utm_source=social&utm_medium=Reddit&utm_campaign=Reddit&utm_id=Reddit).  Since Bitcoin is currently trading at a lower range, profit margins for miners are quite thin even with favorable hosting fees. We are all looking towards the long-term potential of BTC, but if Bitcoin does not skyrocket by the next halving, would it still be worthwhile to mine BTC at these levels within a year's time?

Hashing at a rate of 7820 TH for one year will generate an average of 11.2 BTC under the current Bitcoin mining difficulty. 11.20 BTC at today's Bitcoin trading price of $20,200 USD on 09/14/22 is worth equivalent to $226,240 USD. Under the current Bitcoin price, it will take slightly over a year to achieve ROI if mining with free electricity of if equipment is sold after a year of mining. Given the cost and efficiency of the newer ASIC models that will be entering the ecosystem, the depreciation of Antminer S19 Pro units is calculated to not exceed over 50% and a bundle hashing at 7820 TH could potentially be sold for at least $117,300 USD after a year of mining. Appreciation is also possible but that is only to be expected should the price of Bitcoin skyrocket upon the next halving. This strategy is somewhat favorable if you have a high projection for the price of Bitcoin in the future since you are able to effectively finance equipment to procure more Bitcoin through mining within a year's timeframe. 

[Bitcoin Mining Antminer S19 Pro Bundle](https://preview.redd.it/qa11a1af8vn91.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2d024153a91aad0d22273cbc5e020eeb6c996a8d)

However, Bitcoin's price is currently flat and the cost of electricity is going up. Even if you are able to lock in a favorable electricity rate, then investing in ASICs for mining Bitcoin does not look particularly favorable to achieve ROI within one year unless the price of Bitcoin skyrockets. As of right now, Bitcoin mining is looking very attractive only for companies that are looking for a huge tax write-off for the end of the year. Mined Bitcoin could then be declared as assets for the company for the following year. Retail miners that are looking to capitalize on mining revenue to cover expenses may experience tight margins unless one is able to strategize with debt and financing options. One good things about SHA256 ASICs is that they tend to retain its value a lot longer than ASICs dedicated for other coins. What is your strategy going forward? Are you scaling up or scaling down?",1,bitcoinmining,2022-09-14 18:32:41

The miners with issues are all S19 86T or 90T (240-Ch), which should have APW121215a/b/c according to this website. https://support.bitmain.com/hc/en-us/articles/360034197034-Choose-the-correct-PSU-model-for-your-ANTMINER 

In particular, I‚Äôm working on a S19-86T (240-Ch) which should have a 121215a/b/c PSU but instead the miner was shipped to us with 1214147b, which is the wrong power supply.

Does anyone have any idea what I‚Äôm doing wrong? Were these miners really shipped with the wrong PSU‚Äôs? Why aren‚Äôt 121417a and 121417b interchangeable?

xhw4vj,bigmn2cool,10,https://redd.it/xhw4vj,None,Hosting ASICS in Kazakhstan- 10MW Capacity,"Dear fellow Bitcoiners and Miners,

I am writing here in pursuit of finding customers for hosting their asics at my containerized mining facility in Kazakhstan, Almaty region. Our facility is fully compliant with regulations and ready to plug them in.

One of the reasons why I chose to seek out potential customers this way, is as the current market conditions in Kazakhstan are limited, and local novice retail miners sell their asics and many big miners have fled the country to other destinations earlier this year. We, as an infrastructure provider/hosting facility are facing empty shelves for some time already. Ironically when the regulation has been caught up with the speed of the development of the Bitcoin mining industry in KZ and allowing white list miners to operate. As we are now in full compliance with the regulation, ready to rock-n-roll, we are just without many customers. 

As bad as the market is, there are opportunities as well to obtain new or in good conditions asics in the local KZ market, after a complete checkup at service centers, we could plug them in within days. Customers who are moving their machines from abroad would need to get all documents in good order and contact us to consult.

Hosting fee $0.06/kWh all services included, except repair costs as that will be handled by a 3rd party service center. We are using ProxyFarm for farm management and could also mount BraiinsOS+ upon request for S19 series. All ownership documents will be provided in relation to asics, as well as contract and other documents. There are few reputable companies that trade new asics out of HK with delivery and customs clearance in KZ. All sorts of options are available.

If anyone is crazy enough to be curious and contact me to find out that I genuinely want to find customers for my mining farm. I am a follower of Bitcoin and my reputation is more important to me in this space. All relevant information will be provided upon request.

ximrkn,AsicJungle,4,https://redd.it/ximrkn,None,How will inflation will impact on Bitcoin and Bitcoin mining?,"Inflation has been on the rise in recent months, the main reason for this is an increase in the money supply (M2) over the past two years. This has put upward pressure on commodity prices all across the world.¬†It has been rumored that the Fed's rate increase this week by 0.75%, the biggest rate hike since 1994, is meant to shrink the money supply in the economy, which would help to bring inflation back down to acceptable levels.¬†  


https://preview.redd.it/n2cuin4kevo91.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0a0ea74b08d1cc1014c96f1b1ecda84b85927c89

The Fed's decision to raise rates will have some negative consequences for the economy and we believe in the short term, bitcoin mining. Higher interest rates make it more expensive for consumers and businesses to borrow money, which will lead to slower economic growth. As borrowing becomes more expensive less people mine bitcoin. Although, that is also temporary, as with inflation over 8% and current rates stands at 2.25% to 2.5% it is still a net positive in real terms, to borrow money.¬†However, the rumored rate increase will bring it up at 3% to 3.25%.  


Despite these potential challenges, the Fed believes that fighting inflation is necessary in order to keep the economy on track in the long run. If inflation is left unchecked, it can spiral out of control and lead to an economic downturn. By taking action now, the Fed hopes to avoid such a scenario and keep the economy strong in the years to come. Unfortunately, that is not going to happen; layoffs due to higher inflations rate and lower consumer demand will drive unemployment up in consequence this will feed into the perpetual loop in decreasing consumer demand. Will the Fed maintain its quantitative tightening policy if unemployment rates aggressively go up or will they go back printing more money?¬†  


The most probabilistic scenario is that the money printing will go on before any significant layoffs hit the market. This will further depreciate the value of the dollar. So why not stay ahead of the curve and entertain mining digital gold while it's cheap? With inflation out of control, we believe that people will be seeking alternatives to hedge inflationary currencies. And even if this argument has been mentioned so many times before, there is no better scenario for digital gold to shine than now. After all it's digital gold.

Methane is a powerful greenhouse gas that contributes to global climate change. But what if we could use methane to power bitcoin mining operations? That would be a game-changer for the cryptocurrency industry.  


Bitcoin mining is an energy-intensive process that requires a lot of electricity. In fact, it's estimated that bitcoin mining operations consume about as much electricity as the entire country of Switzerland. This is a huge problem for the environment because most of this electricity is generated by burning fossil fuels such as coal and natural gas.¬†  


However, there is a way to power bitcoin mining operations with sustainable energy. Methane can be used to generate electricity through a process called cogeneration. Cogeneration plants capture the heat that would otherwise be wasted and use it to generate electricity. This process is more efficient than traditional methods of generating electricity, and it results in far fewer emissions.¬†  


In addition, cogeneration plants can be powered by renewable methane sources such as manure or landfill gas. This makes them even more environmentally friendly. If the bitcoin industry were to switch to using cogeneration plants powered by renewable methane, it would be a major step forward in combating climate change.¬†  


The cryptocurrency industry has come under fire in recent years for its huge carbon footprint. However, there is a way to make bitcoin mining more sustainable: by using methane-powered cogeneration plants.

We're going to use air cooling. We're going to have forced air from the outside and each ASIC will have one of those couplers that joins the two exhaust fans into a single 6-inch exhaust hose.

**According to whether the coolant is in contact with the heating parts of the server, it is divided into direct contact liquid cooling and indirect contact liquid cooling**. Among them, direct contact liquid cooling is divided into **immersion liquid cooling** and spray liquid cooling; Indirect contact liquid cooling is basically the use of cold plate and server heating parts contact, coolant flows from the inside of the cold plate, not directly in contact with the heating parts, so it is **usually called cold plate liquid cooling**. 



In the immersion liquid cooling scheme, more and **more manufacturers choose mineral oil as the coolant, so it is generally called immersion liquid cooling technology as ""oil cooling""**; In the cold plate liquid cooling scheme, most manufacturers use deionized water or antifreeze as coolant, so **the cold plate liquid cooling is generally called ""water cooling""**. Below we uniformly call the cold plate liquid cooling as water cooling**, and the immersion liquid cooling as oil cooling.** 

What are the details of the construction costs, server **renovation costs, operating costs, server renewal and resale processes** of the two solutions in practice? It can be confusing for many new customers. Next, we analyze the above latitudes in detail. 

**1. Data center construction cost difference**

Whether it is water-cooled or oil-cooled, the general liquid-cooled data center will be **divided into three modules: cabinet** system, heat exchange system and cooling system, and there is almost no difference between the two modules of heat exchange system and cooling system. **Both water-cooled and oil-cooled are high-temperature coolants that are exchanged for low-temperature coolant through heat exchange systems and cooling systems**, and will not be repeated here. Next, we analyze the differences in cabinet systems in detail in a liquid-cooled data center in container mode. Since the power subsystem and the network subsystem in the cabinet system are configured according to the size of the server, there is almost no difference, and the following is also not described in detail. 

**1) Water-cooled data center**

The main components of the water-cooled container data center are the rack and the coolant circulation system, the rack is used to place the server, and the coolant circulation system needs to ensure the coolant circulation in the server cold plate. **Coolant connectors on servers and racks need to be particularly elaborate to prevent leakage or seepage**. On the other hand, the coolant circulation process of the rack itself can not appear leakage and seepage. In particular, the use of deionized water as a coolant in the water cooling system, we must pay attention to this problem. 

 

Another noteworthy problem is that for the pipeline of coolant flow, it is also necessary to ensure that corrosion or rust cannot occur, so as to avoid poor coolant circulation during long-term operation, resulting in a decrease in heat dissipation.

**2) Oil-cooled data center**

The main components of the oil-cooled container data center are the server placement chamber and the coolant circulation system. The cavity is used to place the server, and the coolant circulation system ensures the smooth circulation of coolant in the cavity. **For the structural design requirements of the cavity, there can be no high temperature coolant circulation can not go out, low temperature coolant can not come back to cause high temperature problems in the machine**. Similarly, there can be no leakage or exudation. 

 

Compared with water cooling, the choice of coolant is more important in oil-cooled solutions. Because all the components of the server are immersed in the coolant, **it is necessary to choose a coolant that is as non-corrosive and good as possible for the machine and has a good thermal conductivity**. 

At present, the price difference between water-cooled and oil-cooled cabinet systems on the market is not much, and **the price of 200 cabinet systems is between 25k and 30k dollars, and the price of each machine is basically between 150-180 dollars**. 

**2. Server transformation cost difference**

Under the water-cooling scheme, the server should be extensively retrofitted. **Liquid cold plates and catheters need to be customized for the server**. Depending on the server, the current **cost of each server is about 150-400 dollars**. 

Modifications are virtually not required in oil-cooled solutions. However, the server needs to be cleaned and a fan simulator installed. **The manual cleaning cost of a server is about 12 dollars, and the fan simulator is 2-3 dollars. Comprehensively calculated, the cost of oil-cooled transformation of a server is about 12 dollars**. 

 

**3. Differences in operating costs**

**Operating costs are comprehensively divided into server operating costs and server O&M costs**„ÄÇ Server operation costs are mainly power costs, and O&M costs mainly refer to fault maintenance costs.

In the water-cooling scheme, some heating components are small, there is no way to install cold plates, and the traditional air cooling method needs to be used. Including hard disks, memory, power supplies, etc. Even if some specific servers do not have hard disks and memory, the control board and power supply need to be cooled. **It is calculated that about 5% to 30% of the heat needs to be cooled by traditional air-cooling**. Therefore, **in the water-cooling solution, the PUE value of the data center is generally between 1.15-1.25.** 

In the oil-cooled solution, the server is immersed in the coolant as a whole, and all components can be dissipated by the coolant circulation, without the need for more electricity to cool. In general, the PUE value is below 1.1, and in the **oil-cooled scheme in the northern region, the PUE value can be controlled below 1.04 or even 1.02.** 

Under the liquid cooling technology solution, the failure rate of the server is much lower than that of traditional air cooling. In the event of a failure, **oil cooling is slightly more complicated than water cooling**. Water cooling requires the coolant inlet and outlet to be closed tightly off the shelf. Oil cooling requires the server to be removed from the coolant and cleaned before it can be repaired. 

 

**4. Update server cost**

**1) Water cooling scheme to replace the server**

**For data center builders, because the server** structure of each manufacturer is different, once the server is replaced, it needs to be customized transformation, and the cost of transformation is not easy to estimate. **If major changes are needed, the cost could be close to rebuilding a system**. If you continue to host the server of the same manufacturer, and the manufacturer is compatible in the server structure, the cost is relatively controllable. 

**From the server owner's perspective.** In the water-cooled solution, the **server liquid cold plate needs to be customized separately** and used for life after customization. Generally, it cannot be replaced on other servers and reused. If you update or replace the server, you need to customize the cold board for the server. 

**2) Replace the server with oil-cooled solution**

For data center builders, oil-cooled cabinets are made up of server chambers. When replacing the server, in view of the different structural differences of different servers, there is a **possibility of putting more or a few less, and no secondary transformation is required, and the cost is controllable**. 

For server owners, the cost **of an oil-cooled transformation is about 10 dollars, and the cost is relatively controllable**. 

**5. Server resale**

At present, the application of liquid cooling technology is becoming more and more extensive, but there are still some conceptual differences in some participants. **Servers that have been retrofitted with water or oil cooling have some hurdles in the resale process.** 

For water-cooled retrofitted servers, if water-cooled is **continued to be used, the receiver needs to have a water-cooled machine. If you change back to the traditional air-cooled mode, you also need to re-engineer the server**. Therefore, the modified water-cooled server has some drawbacks in the resale process. 

For oil-cooled modified servers, **if oil-cooled is continued to be used, the receiver is also required to have an oil-cooled seat. If you change back to the traditional air-cooled mode, you only need to install a fan**. However, the oil-cooled server is changed back to the air-cooled mode because it has been soaked in oil, and it is easy to stick to dust, dust, etc., and the oil on the surface of each component of the server can be cleaned by washing the plate water. After cleaning, it can basically be used like a traditional air-cooled server.

xom2cu,AsicJungle,1,https://redd.it/xom2cu,None,One Bitcoin Equals One Bitcoin,"The long and short of it is that One Bitcoin equals one bitcoin. There is only one Bitcoin, and that is the Bitcoin that was created by Satoshi Nakamoto in 2009.

First, a quick refresher on how bitcoin works. Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency that can be sent from user to user on the peer-to-peer bitcoin network without the need for an intermediary like a bank or a government. Transactions are verified by network nodes through cryptography and recorded in a public dispersed ledger called a blockchain. Bitcoins are created as a reward for a process known as mining.

When computers successfully add a block to the blockchain, they are rewarded with newly created bitcoins and transaction fees. This provides an incentive for people to contribute their computing power to the network and verify transactions. So, what does it mean when one bitcoin equals one bitcoin? It means that the value of one bitcoin is backed by another bitcoin. There is no third-party or central authority that can issue more bitcoins or stabilize the price if there is volatility.

This makes bitcoin different from other traditional investments like stocks, bonds, and fiat currencies. The recent surge in the price of bitcoin has caught many people off guard, but those who have been following the cryptocurrency closely shouldn't be surprised.

The value of one bitcoin is directly linked to the underlying network of users and miners who support it‚Äîand as more people adopt and use bitcoin, the value will continue to rise. So, whether you're an investor or a miner, now is the time to get involved in bitcoin.

I'm VERY bullish on BTC long term, and I'm worried this bear market may be my last chance to get into mining in a big way before its too late. My goal long term is to aquire as much bitcoin as I possibly can, and play a part in securing the network. 

On one hand I want to keep the little btc I have to hodl for minimum of 10 years. I bought at the top and averaged down, but ultimately I'm down a lot in fiat terms. (Don't really care that much about the ""loss"" since .15 btc = .15 btc). 

On the other hand, if I miss the opportunity I have to buy as many ASICs as I possibly can during this bear market, I know I'm going to be kicking myself when we are on a bull run.

Looking for some feedback to help me make a decision.

TLDR - Should I cash out of my small .15 btc holding to help fund an s19 XP, or should I wait and risk being priced out if a bull run happens soon.

I'm paying about .08c/ kwh. S19 - $6700 (edited for price correction) for the 141T vs 3000 for the 110 T? I like the efficiency and future proof of the 141.

For Bitcoin mining, is this price range of decent value with the Antminer S19 XP being more powerful but more costly? The Antminer S19 XP BTC miner at 141TH is selling around $7000 per unit right now. How does the market feel the [Antminer S19 Pro](https://wattum.io/?utm_source=social&utm_medium=Reddit&utm_campaign=Reddit&utm_id=Reddit) should be priced with the new XP models entering the ecosystem? The Antminer XP requires more upfront cost but it might be better in the long-run. However, the barrier of entry is now very low for ASIC mining with the Antminer S19 Pro and it could be very worthwhile at the current price range if Bitcoin rallies hard within a year.

xzo0xd,throwawaymdd7,4,https://redd.it/xzo0xd,None,New S19J Pro 96 Hashing 0 Log," 

Hi. I have a new S19J Pro 96T that seems to behave normally but then Real Time Hashrate turns red and the hashrate stays at 0. It never even connects to my pool. I think it's shipping damage, the hashboards got damaged which I've never seen on a new one, but I wanted a second opinion. Do you think there's any point in opening a warranty ticket? Or just have it fixed myself? I just posted the last part of the log because the Automod removed my comment if I posted the whole thing. Thanks in advance.

I never mined btc, but I'm looking into an asic as the cheapest heater I can think of.

I'd like to buy a machine that can heat up a room of 20mq (so around 1200w to 2000w ), preferably one that I can mod with some ~~artic case~~ fans ~~I have around already (14cm P14)~~ to reduce the noise or not too noisy already.

And I need to get that in Europe (shengen area), budget under 3000 euro.

Where can I look to purchase one? which models would you recommend?

as for profitability... well, that's not what I have in mind: electricity cost is going to skyrocket 10x this winter, this is just a way to save something on the side by avoiding to turn up the main heating.

y3x8i0,wattumofficial,7,https://redd.it/y3x8i0,None,Is The Brand New Antminer S19 XP 134TH / 141TH A Good Deal At $33 / TH?,"The Bitcoin mining hash rate has gone up this month with an influx of the Antminer S19 XP entering the ecosystem. Bitcoin, however, has stayed resilient as it bounced over 1000 points today from the strong demand range of the low $18,000 that opened the market yesterday. Just 4 month ago, the pre-sale cost for the Antminer S19 XP was $90 / TH as owning a single unit would cost over $10,000. Today, the Antminer S19 XP costs only $33 / TH with variations in the 134 TH and 141 TH models. The price of the ASIC dropped much more compared to the increase in hashing difficulty. The price of Bitcoin has also fallen from the $28,000 range during the time when pre-sale for the Antminer S19 XP launched.  


Due to Antminer S19 XP's efficiency in power consumption, it would cost around $208 USD per month to run a unit at [Wattum's](https://wattum.io/?utm_source=social&utm_medium=Reddit&utm_campaign=Reddit&utm_id=Reddit) competitive hosting rates. If miners can afford to sell Bitcoin at a later date closer to the $28,000 range, then it would appear that the current cost of $33 / TH for the Antminer S19 XP may be attractive as the 134 TH model would only cost $4,422 USD. Is this rate considered a good deal?

y72q3d,Skrovno_CZ,6,https://redd.it/y72q3d,None,[Question] What is the goal of bitcoin mining? (except making money),"Hello,

I was searching about this topic but I'm unable to understand what mining really is.  
I always thought that this solving of mathematical problems and calculating hashes is useful for a specific group of scientists in some corporation but looks like this is not it. I also thought that quantum computer could calculate these hashes faster but I've read that quantum computer does not have algorithm to calculate sha256 hashes.  
Is mining bitcoins for a miner useful in any other way than making profit? Can I use the calculations for anything other than bitcoin? For example file integrity check? (can I calculate these hashes offline whill not mining bitcoins?)

Who pays for the hashes (is it one corporation... or maybe everyone in the world owning a computer?) and is there anything like a final result or is it just an endless counting?

I'm sorry but I really don't understand it how it works even that I've read a lot about it.

  
When I make a product, I can sell it to a customer/consumer. I will make profit and the consumer will... probably satisfy hunger (depending if the product is edible or just for fun like electronics). But who is the consumer of the hashes to pay for these calculations? Is there anything like ""enormous file"" that needs endless sha256 integrity check or something or is it a waste of resources like ""leaving lightbulb turned on whill nobody is home and getting payd for that for some reason"" or is it something really important? I'm clueless.

Thanks in advance for explanation.",2,bitcoinmining,2022-10-18 10:00:22

y8qkhj,MaiRufu,29,https://redd.it/y8qkhj,None,I took a job 1200 miles from home. AMA,"Let me put the setting down. I'm 25 M. Lives in central Ohio.  Huge nerd when it comes to anything technology based. I have a family of 2 kids and one loving fiancee. 

So. It's July. Money's running tight. I can no longer be a stay at home dad so I get a job working at a hotel chain.  My job was to fold towels and get the House keeping carts stocked for the next day. Super lame. Didn't pay much it and was 3rd shift so I never was able to see my family. Few months go by. One night I take a poop and sit down open reddit like we all do. I start scrolling.  10 mins go by. I'm about done and I see this post on r/Bitcoinmining ""now hiring in FWD area."" (Fort worth Dallas I had to Google it). They where in need of some one to work on machines and help get caught up on tickets.  It's 16 hours from my house. For shits and giggle not expecting it to actually hit.i out my self out there.  

""Mining since 2012, fixing machines since 2015 managed my own mine with over 150 machines. I'm willing to make the drive to work this job."" I press send and continue about my shift and forgot I even sent it. 

I get home about 8am and a message comes into my DMs something along the lines ""hey I'm Chris. Owner of Mining Syndicate."" We chat for a bit.  I tell him I would walk out of my job right now if I had the gas money to get down there right now and prove my self. The world stopped for a moment in my life with the next reply being ""what's your Venmo?"" 

I gave him the information and he sends me 200$ with the reply. See you soon.  I kinda lost it for a bit. I called my mom my grandma my GF was extremely excited I called my discord friends screaming. I was so excited and seriously couldn't contain my self. Now. I will make a note. Almost everyone I knew was telling me, they are gonna harvest your organs or kidnap you. I said good point. Let me roll on it.  (When I can't decide something I roll a D20) 

Well my dice hate me so I rolled 3 of them.  

If it's high. I go.  

If it's low. I return the money and keep the hotel job. 

17, 9, 19

I sat there with a smile on my face for like 10 mins looking at these dice.  Son of a bitch. I'm going. I called my boss. I said I unfortunately can't continue working here. I grabbed my Gaming PC my GF packed my suitcase. And left that next morning. 

1 stop at an old friends house in AR and I was in Texas at 7am the next morning. 2 hours of sleep in the car. I roll up and get out of the car. I walk in the building and I'm nervous. I left my firearm in the car. Am I going to get my kidney yoinked? Then Chris walks out from his office and he introduces himself. Boom. Kidneys secure.  

A few hours pass by we are interviewing. Getting into buckets of information left and right. Very unconventional compared to other companies interviewing. But I dig it. 

I'm now in my 3 day trial. I start fixing machines left and right getting stuff on track. I'm feeling the old energy pumping things are clicking. Time passes


6 hours into my trial. I am hired on the spot. I'm flabbergasted. I seriously tried so hard not to tear up. The job of a life time is now mine. We discuss pay the next day. I won't get into actual dollar amounts. But he immediately offers paid travel, an onsite RV, wear and tear on the car and a bit more from what I was making at the hotel. I have been working here for now 2-3 months and every day is a joy to get out of bed. I absolutely love this job and this company.  

My first week I got my first compliment from a big client. I was stunned. ""nice hire Chris"" 

So. It's 3 weeks in Dallas. And 1 week home with the family. Both ways paid for.  Is that hard. Yes. I miss my family terribly. But they understand this is the job I have been waiting for and I can't thank them enough for letting me do it.  

This is my story. I wrote it at 1am. So I might add some more details In the morning.  Ask me anything.

y979w6,Crypto_US_Tax,4,https://redd.it/y979w6,None,Details of Bitcoin Mining,"I am currently working on an article discussing why Bitcoin is distinct from other cryptocurrencies.  My audience is the retirement plan community and those advising funds and creating 401(k) investment menus.  I think one thing that is distinct about bitcoin is the PoW and the power of the computing system.  So I am attempting to ""briefly"" explain the mining process and was hoping somebody could provide some insight on the hash function bitcoin miners use.  

This is what I have so far:

""One of the ways the Bitcoin protocol uses a hash function is to mine a new block.  A new block is mined when a miner inputs a nonce (or for those who prefer plain English, a guess) that produces a hash value that is lesser than or equal to the target hash.  While beyond the scope of this paper, because we are skeptical our readers have the desire to read in great detail about Merkle trees, there are some aspects of the input that Bitcoin miners put into the mining hash function that are determined by the hash value of potential transactions contained in the block.  A Merkle tree allows distinct pieces of data to be grouped together and made accessible via a single hash.  If a miner changes the potential transactions contained in the block, the hash value will change completely.  This is important as it allows for the possibility of nonces to be extremely high as the number of available transactions that can occur in a box is extremely high.  As currently constructed, there are 2 to the 96th power nonces available for bitcoin miners to select.  That number is an eight followed by 28 zeros.  As a result of the input to the hash function miners are trying to solve including the unique hash values of transactions included in the block, each new block involves a new problem to be solved and requires the miners to go through the 2 to the 96th power nonces until a solution is found that meets the target hash value solution.""

First, is that paragraph mostly accurate keeping in mind the audience does not possess PhDs in mathematics and computer science.  The thing I am confused about is does the hash function input that a miner uses to solve the next block have some items that the miner does not control?  Such as the blockheads of the previous block?  I understand each block creates a new problem that needs to be solved so if a previous miner lost the race to be mine the block the same nonce would not be valid for the next block.  However, through my research I am unsure why that is the case.  My best guess is the miner does not control some of the data that needs to be used for the hash function input for each block.  Thus each block creates a unique problem that must be solved by examining the nonces all over again.

Any insight would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks for your time.",1,bitcoinmining,2022-10-20 19:20:29
y9k68e,805CryptoServices,17,https://redd.it/y9k68e,None,Introducing Communal Mining!,"Let's say a guy has enough cash to buy a single s19j pro. He sends  it off for hosting and all is good. Then the miner has an issue and  needs repairs. Now he's lost 100% of his mining income while it is down  for repairs. 

My proposal is ""communal mining"". We get a  group of people that are ready to buy 1 or more miners each and pool their resources to buy and host 10-20 miners together. The hashrate gets pooled together and each member gets paid out monthly based on the number of miners he contributes to the pool. Now if one miner goes down  you only lose 5-10% of the mining income. 

Benefits:

* You get to spread the risk of downtime over the pool of miners.
* Get a better deal on the hardware when the group buys in bulk.
* Potentially get a better hosting rate than you would hosting a single machine.

The down side is you lose some control such as getting to pick your own mining pool.

I have hosting lined up at 8c if we can get 20 machines. Plus if we get 20 I'll add a spare miner that can be put online if one of the pool miners goes down.

Delmarva has experienced uncontrollable growth since inception. We keep tapping the brakes, but you guys KEEP SENDING IT üòÖ

The¬†momentum we've experienced is a direct result of your commitment¬†to our shared success as a colocation¬†provider. The synergy we've created together has produced affordable and renewable energy for everyone partnered with Delmarva.

If you have not already done so, ask yourself this: ""Am I an¬†**investor**¬†or a¬†**speculator**?""

Traditionally, investors use a systematic approach to growing their wealth slowly, buying assets with reasonable levels of risk (in exchange for long-term returns). Bitcoin investors place the highest focus on fundamentals - these are the ""laser¬†eyes.""

Conversely, speculators buy assets that may experience rapid growth but can also go to ZERO. Bitcoin speculators place the highest focus on price action - often attracted by FOMO to provide the necessary liquidity for institutions to exit (quietly and profitably).

We've ALL read ""the tortoise and the hare"", so we ALL know that slow and steady¬†wins the race.The good news is...¬†**Bitcoin is a marathon, not a sprint.**

[and now for the best news... Bitcoin is now less risky than the S&P 500](https://decrypt.co/112566/bitcoin-now-less-volatile-than-sp-500-nasdaq-for-first-time-since-2020) ü•π

So if you've been thinking about adding more ASICs to your stack, you're not alone. In case you aren't watching... the signs are everywhere ‚Äì hardware bottomed out, Bitcoin consolidated into a range, and the US Dollar hasn't been this strong since 2002

**Are¬†we in the stealth¬†phase of this market cycle? ü§î**üò≥

If you've been thinking about growing your mining business, there may not be a better time than right now. If Bitcoin is truly in the stealth phase, then take-off is imminent. ***Delmarva is ready for action with +2MW of capacity open today,***¬†**and 25MW of construction¬†planned¬†over the next 5 years.** The sustainable growth of your business is our top priority, and we sincerely appreciate the opportunity to serve you moving forward. **Please don't FOMO buy the ATH when hardware costs are 10x higher than now... Let's DCA your procurement plan and wade-in to the hardware market slowly.**

It's¬†time to start thinking about the S19 XP Hydro ‚Äì ***the fastest liquid-cooled Bitcoin miner of any manufacturer's pipeline***. This ASIC produces a constant 250Th/s at approximately 5200W (roughly 20.8J/T efficiency). The promotional price will be revealed at the WDMS Global 2022 SVIP dinner on November 9, 8:00 PM (local time in Cancun).

**Immediately following Bitmain's reveal, Delmarva will extend a 72-Hour special offer for new and existing clients to buy and host the new S19 XP Hydro during**¬†***WDMS Global 2022***¬†**in Cancun (November 8-10, 2022)**

If our TA is good, get ready for one hell of a bull run

yhxvp8,KURTBOURDAIN,18,https://redd.it/yhxvp8,None,Warning! Avoid business with Wattum Management,"Without getting into the fine details, I felt I needed to warn others of the potential issues that could arise when doing business with Wattum.

Earlier this year, I entered a purchase and hosting agreement with Wattum. The total hardware purchased was approximately $95,000 with an expected launch in early July 2022.

Following several hosting delays, both parties decided to terminate the hosting agreement in late August 2022 with the expectation that they'd send me my purchased hardware.

Unfortunately, when it came time to ship my miners, Wattum didn't actually have my hardware. I informed them this was a breach of the original purchase contract, which specifies that the miners purchased at the time of the agreement were within Wattum's possession and control - which was clearly not the case. I then promptly asked for a refund.

Now for the past two months, Wattum has repeatedly asked me to accept alternative equipment. They typically either email or text me a new offer every 2-3 weeks, then ghost me every time I ask for a refund. They are essentially holding my money hostage until I accept a new deal. Money which they were never entitled to in the first place.

I am definitely not the first person this has happened to with this company ([https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/tq9wup/buyers\_beware\_of\_wattum\_management\_inc/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/tq9wup/buyers_beware_of_wattum_management_inc/)) but hopefully I will be one of the last.

I have filed wire fraud charges with my bank and am in the process of ironing out details with a Lawyer. Next steps are filing a police report, FTC complaint, and potentially FBI complaint.

I will continue to update this thread and pursue all legal means as necessary until I receive my money back from Wattum.",37,bitcoinmining,2022-10-31 02:09:29

With crypto not doing so well I am hoping getting good asics is a reality nowadays, but I haven't done much research on this yet

Does anyone have suggestions? General requirements I am thinking I need:

* Low power usage (300-500w) buts still decent power to profitability ratio - I don't want to trip breakers that are utilized by other appliances
* Relatively quiet
* Standalone

I wanted to share my review of my just-arrived ultimate beast, the all-new Bitmain Antminer KA3.

Thanks to FlowMiners, they're always the first.

First we go into the boxing.

Pretty basic, the simple Bitmain packaging

Nothing fancy for a newly difficulty beating machine but I'm fine with it.

Can you smell it already?

Next into the outer look

Bitmain has a way of simplifying their machines that they all almost look the same.

Kudos to the project designer 10/10

yq5g7n,hacoby78,12,https://redd.it/yq5g7n,None,Compass Mining Customer Support is terrible," I purchased a brand new L7 miner through compass that went on briefly in May. It then went offline  and has been offline ever since. I have emailed compass countless times since but only got replies saying compass is in contact with the facility and will get back to me.

Finally, at the end of July, I eventually got in contact with Frederick Gimino who has the title of service manager. He seemed to offer assurances and even said they would waive the repair fee for the inconvenience. He said it would be completed in a few weeks. I appreciated this and was hopeful. 

But once again radio silence. I reached back out to Frederik and got no response. Eventually he responds back that they cant do repairs b/c the facility is offline dealing with power issues. When I checked, he had the wrong facility. When I pointed this out and said its a different facility, again...no response. (notice a pattern?)

Im still waiting to hear anything meaningful from them. Its been 7 months. Im not even sure they know where the miner is. Their avoidance is has me concerned about their capableness. 

Basically if you have any issues with a repair they can't be trusted. They dont give you any information and dont seem to have any processes in place to explain and troubleshoot with customers. They just reply every few weeks without any new info (or incorrect info) and ask you to be patient. 

I think they might be too big now for retail investors. Or worse their customer service is broken somehow and they are oblivious or just dont care.",12,bitcoinmining,2022-11-09 02:00:09

Share miner revenue statistics from f2pool.

A few months later another violent market shake occurred. It seems that this time we need to rethink the way of storing cryptocurrencies.

Most users who mine at f2pool will choose exchanges as the way to store mining revenues(the payout threshold of BTC at f2pool is 0.005), but for HOLDers and big funds, it seems that there is indeed a risk, so, You can choose to change it to your cold wallet address in your account settings, keep mining, and keep holding!",3,bitcoinmining,2022-11-10 17:00:23

yrljso,Xinqiu-,2,https://redd.it/yrljso,None,Some insights from FTX this time as a normal miner.,"Many miners pursued rapid expansion plans during a bull market, taking on large amounts of debt to finance machines and infrastructure to grow hashrate.

However, their operating performance and liquidity have been severely impacted by the prolonged drop in the price of Bitcoin, a rise in electricity costs, and increased competition in the bear market.

Controlling risk, reducing debt and maintaining positive cash flow are the necessary rules for survival in a bear market.

As the weather turns colder, and we are heading into winter months, more mining farms are powering up with higher performance machines like S19XPs, we can expect it will be more and more difficult to mine with objective profit.

Well, it's been colder than expected. Right now it's 24 degrees. Tonight 3 of my machines got too cold and stopped running. I just unplugged them and am waiting for it to warm up tomorrow.

I work at a small investment management company and have been using this trading journal created by one of my IT co-workers in light and dark themes.

It lets me record and analyze the trades I take, and also helps me improve a trading strategy, comparing the trades by the criteria they meet and seeing what works best for me.

The template comes with instructions in pdf files that explain in detail how it works and you can find the answer to any question you may have about this journal.

My co-worker made it off-hours so he's cool about me sharing it.

Here's a glimpse of it:

zdtg48,gusmeowmeow,9,https://redd.it/zdtg48,None,Compass Mining Support is Trash,"I have a few miners operating with Compass. One of the facilities has been down for months - I get that shit happens - except Compass decides to incorrectly list this offline miner as being in a facility that is still up so I end up getting charged for hashing that never happened.

After I repeatedly messaged their support someone eventually got back to me and confirmed that the miner was incorrectly listed and updated it to be listed in the correct facility.

But the charges remain.

Whats worse is that the fees are lumped together with legitimate fees for the miner in the facility thats running so I cannot pay the miner that was hashing without paying for one that has been down for months.

Now I'm receiving emails from Compass saying that my miner (both of them) will be taken offline and/or I will be charged late fees.

Ive repeatedly responded to the open tickets and opened new one and received no reply for weeks.

This is complete bullshit and the support with this company is absolute trash.

A few months ago I built and launched [Hashbranch](https://app.hashbranch.com) \- a listing & review marketplace for bitcoin miner hosting companies. [Original post here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMining/comments/x2f7bd/yelp_for_bitcoin_miner_hosting_businesses/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)

Since launch we have had the pleasure of helping multiple different people find hosting through the platform, and similarly we've helped multiple hosting providers showcase their business.

We've recently been exploring ways that we can help the brokers in the space, who have done a great job building relationships and closing deals.

Our goal is to put forward a standard of how this industry works together, based on trust, transparency and efficiency. If you are a broker in the bitcoin mining space, we want to work with you to help shape what we're building and how we're building it.

At the peak of the bull market in November 2021, an Antminer S19j Pro cost around $11,000. Despite the high price of the machines, the expected payback period at the time was only 13 months due to the highly profitable Bitcoin mining.

The price of mining machines has fallen by more than 80% in the past year. This may have inspired the investment willingness of many miners.

zjw80e,hachebaker,0,https://redd.it/zjw80e,None,Presenting: Krater.io - The first Real Time Data based Marketplace for PoW mining. And the first management software made for hosting providers.,"Hi community!

We are proud to announce [Krater.io](https://Krater.io), a project we've been working since 2021.   
We are building the first real-time data based Marketplace for PoW ASIC mining. For this we leverage our software that helps monitor and manage mining operations with a strong focus on hosting data centers.

Right now our software could help you: 

&#x200B;

* Manage ASICs (change pools, restart, shutdown and start machines) and monitoring (temps, hashrate, alerts, logs‚Ä¶)
* Manage multiple locations with different energy prices
* Manage multiple customers (if you offer hosting)
* Provide dashboards for customers with different levels of control for them. They can change pools or restart machines from Krater without having to go through your support channels.
* Setet price tiers for different customers (depending on volume for example).
* Automate invoice generation and payments. We are about to release an automated blockchain based payment system, so hosting fees can be paid daily. If a customer runs out of credit, machines stop working or switch to the provider's pool until credit is topped up.
* Scheduling system for curtailment (turn off machines between certain times and dates to comply with grid requirements).

All from a single unified dashboard.

I can gladly share some Demo Accounts for those interested in checking out our software.

We have also released this week the first iteration of the marketplace. If any of you DC operators out there want to list their offerings on [Krater.io](https://Krater.io), please feel free to fill out this form [https://forms.gle/ziBZqLADAE3niCv8A](https://forms.gle/ziBZqLADAE3niCv8A) so we can add your listing to our website!",1,bitcoinmining,2022-12-12 11:23:00

zkawv9,PsychoticDisorder,5,https://redd.it/zkawv9,None,Maximum OC on stock PSU with AIR cooling. Comparison S19 vs S19 Pro vs S19J Pro,"Good day people. 

&#x200B;

I'm reaching out to the community. I'm on the market for 2-3 Asics. I haven't decided yet which model to choose and I would like your input to help me decide. The main feature that I'm looking for is how much I can safely overclock them. I'm looking for max TH/s not maximum efficiency. The Asics will be installed in a temperature controlled environment, room is always at 20 degrees Celsius, with cold air blowing directly at them. 

I'm between S19, S19 Pro and S19J Pro. I'm gonna go with the lowest possible TH/s as initial purchase since it's actually the same model with the same PSU but with lower TH/s thus making it cheaper to purchase.  I can find S19 at 83TH/s @ $1600, S19 Pro at 100TH/s @ $2200 and S19J Pro at 104 TH/s @ $2300. 

I can also find M30s at 90TH/s @ $1800, M30s+ at 100TH/s @ $2000, M30s++ at 108TH/s @ $2200, Aval 1246 at 85TH/s @ $1500, etc. I'm not considering any other brand except Antminer since I'm already familiar with them and I believe are the ones that have a bigger variety of custom firmwares for OC. 

Of course if you have real life experience for any of the aforementioned models, besides Antminer, that do better in OC than Antminer please speak up!

Let's say that power isn't an issue. Since all three of the Antminers need 20A input and their PSUs have 2 inputs I could go up to 2x15A (30A total) per Asic, if its PSU can handle it of course. 

I would like to have real world experience as to which firmware provider do you prefer for your OC needs and what is the max TH/s I could reach with each of these models with the stock PSU. 

Thank you.",0,bitcoinmining,2022-12-12 20:46:29

Anyway, I'm looking at Compass mining, among other hosting providers, and the math doesn't add up to me. Not even close!

E.g.

So I would be losing money off the bat, without even considering the initial investment. The situation is no different with other miners listed on their site.

So what's the point? Why is anyone investing in hosted mining and consequently, how are these companies still around?

zlxoua,Keith_Kong,3,https://redd.it/zlxoua,None,Known Mining Integrated Appliances?,"Been going down the rabbit hole looking into home/business appliances that integrate Bitcoin mining into their hardware. I'm specifically interested in appliances which require heat as part of their function, where the ASIC heat is leveraged as the source.

Some categories on my radar:

**Heaters**  
I'm aware of [HeatBit](https://www.heatbit.com/) as a space heater option. Pricey upfront cost but the energy usage is equivalent to other space heaters so any time it's on you essentially mine Bitcoin for free. Still, even with constant usage of the heater it will likely take 3-4 years to pay off. You'll likely end up with more Bitcoin just buying and holding right now.

Any other heater companies, or contractors working on a more integrated heating solution for a home or office? I came across a [video by Wilson Mining](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5w8YNBPFKJc&lc=Ugxp76HP0AQgaBYYzyR4AaABAg.9jYZWcFxe9g9jZKLIUyOvP) where a customer of theirs built out home and pool heating himself so it's definitely a viable possibility (at least in some situations).

**Hot Tubs**  
I'm aware of [this](https://twitter.com/DocumentingBTC/status/1399472395954626565?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1399472395954626565%7Ctwgr%5E6b271e8257d6fb7ff3a51d2d842ba43077c54f8d%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fhottubinsider.com%2Fhot-tubs-heated-by-bitcoin-mining%2F) home project and there's even an online guide on [How to Build a Hot Tub Mining Machine](https://es.braiins.com/blog/how-to-build-a-hot-tub-mining-machine). This could make a lot more sense than the space heater given many people like to keep their hot tub ready to go all the time during the cold months and the general upfront cost of a hot tub is already a larger purchase. Still, you likely aren't making a killing and would still do better buying and holding Bitcoin with that extra cost.

Any companies looking to manufacture and sell Bitcoin Mining Hot Tubs?

**Dryers**  
I wasn't able to track down anyone working on a dryer prototype (unless you count [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/u4bno5/using_bitcoin_miners_as_a_clothes_dryer/) lol) let alone a real product. This seems like a great opportunity in the context of a laundromat where machines are frequently being used. I could even see just a portion of machines in a laundromat have mining and you would give a slight discount to incentivize that one being used first (so as long as some customers are drying those are likely running).

Anyone heard of something around this being pursued?

**Other**  
Any other obscure ideas you've seen floating around? I love this vision of integrating mining into all the various aspects of my home. Even if it's not a superior investment, I can see myself wanting to eventually pursue it just to participate in mining (and because it can ultimately be profitable while directly offsetting my fixed monthly costs).",0,bitcoinmining,2022-12-14 17:59:32

zm0vsn,PaintMysterious717,6,https://redd.it/zm0vsn,None,HeatBit worthwhile or just a gimmick?,"I think I already know the answer to this but I figured I would ask to get some more expert opinion.

My wife recently asked me to buy a electric heater to use by her desk in the winter, we live in a climate that is cold at least 6 months out of the year. I had seen ads for this [HeatBit](https://www.heatbit.com/) product which mines BTC and acts as a space heater with the heat produced from mining. Really cool idea, but honestly I know almost nothing about mining.

After running some basic numbers it looks like it would really depend on the price of BTC increasing for you to get back the excess cost of the unit through mining. Now.. I do believe we will see another rise in the price of BTC to some new all time high in the next few years which is why I would consider this in the first place. Something in my research that I do not fully understand is that hashrate seems to diminish slightly by the day. So this device will produce less BTC over time. Also the upcoming halving that will make this even less profitable by a leap.

That being said, given that I would be spending the energy costs anyway on a space heater doing nothing. Is this unit worth considering or just a total gimmick from your perspective. From my basic math it would take 6 years to pay for itself assuming the price stayed at $17k and never fluctuated significantly. However if it went back up to around $40K+ that timeline drops drastically.",1,bitcoinmining,2022-12-14 20:10:26

zo5p7j,Junior_Client3022,10,https://redd.it/zo5p7j,None,does my math check out with these solar panels,"So I was just curious how many panels + Battery's I would need to run just a single antminer s19pro. This would also be a perfect world where the sun always shi ed.

So given the miner is drawing 3000w of power we need roughly 72,000wh for 24 hours of full run time.

For a 200w 12v panel it gives roughly 1000wh a day.
That's about 72 panels total, double that number for 100w panels.

For the Batterys we are looking at 1200wh lithium ions. That means we need 60 of these things.

So after doing some pricing I came up with a few numbers for the panels and batterys at roughly $200 each:

Panels: $14,400
Batterys: $12,00
Total: $26,400.

That's just for a single antminer.
Not to mention storage, maintenance, hardware, plugs, cords, and then just realistically double the number because the sun only shines max 9 hours in the winter.


So looking at close to $75k+ to run a single antminer off the grid? That's 34 years to break even at current prices. Does that seem right?",12,bitcoinmining,2022-12-17 12:53:09

zud5lj,ChoicesGamezYT,10,https://redd.it/zud5lj,None,Mining For Heat lol,So I turned off my miner last month because it just wasn't profitable BUT now with it being 18 degrees outside I thought I'd try something. Lol in the winter my light bill goes up an additional $6 a day. My miner alone makes it go up only about $3 a day. We all know the heat these things put out so I brought it in turned off the upstairs and downstairs heat. Because it's so cold the fans don't run as much and I just checked the downstairs is 66 degrees and upstairs is 63. So ehhhh idk ü§£ü§£ probably not worth it unless I walk around with a blanket. I'll definitely turn the heat up when I have guests tho,2,bitcoinmining,2022-12-24 16:26:27

zvl0yd,Metal_Early,2,https://redd.it/zvl0yd,None,Public miner Stronghold Digital - huge homerun during christmas power surge,"Merry Christmas everyone!

&#x200B;

Stronghold Digital owns and runs their two own coal refuse power plants. During this christmas break (and still ongoing) theres been elevated power prices in the PJM grid which Stronghold are able to sell into.  They¬¥ve spent all previous quarters maintaining and optimizing their power plants for exactly this scenario.

&#x200B;

A local investor writes on Twitter:

""My very preliminary computations suggest that for the 24 hour period from around 8am December 23 to 8am December 24, average MWh was around 1,291. Assuming that's generally in range, and assuming we were online the whole time, it represents approximate revenue of $5,112,360.""

&#x200B;

During 25th and 26th, they¬¥ve made nearly $5M in addition to this, and it still continues. Their quartelry revenue was estimated to be $20M... Its already a fact they¬¥ll blow right trough all estimaes... The stock is one of the most shorted somehow, which makes for a really interesting setup. Just wanted to highlight it, do you own due dilligence, its a sweet sweet setup.

&#x200B;

Have a nice continuation and Happy New Year 2023!",6,bitcoinmining,2022-12-26 11:08:55

zxim6k,Thanis_in_Eve,1,https://redd.it/zxim6k,None,How do I get my own pool running?,"I have several ASICs, I have a full node running. I want to create a pool and point my ASICs to my own node. I've tried the latest version of bfgminer with Bitcoin core 22, 24 and 17 on Ubuntu server. The node is fully synced, and returns information when I run 'bitcoin-cli getblocktemplate."" Bfgminer connects successfully to the node over rpc. I can see port 3334 for stratum open and listening using netstat. But when I point the miners to the ip:port, it connects to one of the backup entries after failing to connect to my node. The miners connect fine to antpool, luxor, solo ckpool, and any other pool. I can tell port 3334 is open on my node by telnetting to it from a PC. Bfgminer even throws an error when the connection fails. I do not see anything when attempting to connect my miners to bfgminer. 

Short of hiring a developer to write the code for me, what are my options? Is there anyone that has this working themselves and if so, how did you do it? 

I'm feeling pretty defeated here and I'm having a very hard time understanding why the decision was made to ensure the tools needed to run a mining pool were so difficult to obtain. Shouldn't stratum be part of Bitcoin core inherently, or if not, shouldn't the maintainers of Bitcoin core also maintain a program that can be used to connect miners to the current version of Bitcoin core running on a  node? Unless I'm being a doofus and missed something pretty basic, this seems pretty flawed. 

I'd really appreciate any help, even if it's an explanation of why this won't work.",3,bitcoinmining,2022-12-28 19:32:55

Going to add 5 s19j pro's to lincoin and see how that goes.

Interested in any thoughts or comments on either of these pools or suggestions on another pool.",5,bitcoinmining,2022-12-30 15:40:13
