ChadRun04,"&gt; Bitcoin Network lacks the maneuverability to implement changes &amp; new technology. 

Does it? We just passed Taproot.

&gt; no specific organization cemented as leaders. Therefore, simple changes are often disputed

Unlike Vitalik who just goes ""51% ATTACK!!! Quick merge!"" when miners don't agree with his idea of consensus.

Is that a good thing?

&gt; Third, Bitcoin was of course the first network ever launched. Therefore, it is based on the most simple, albeit functional, technology. It lacks smart contract support and requires a second layer for any type of feasible scaling.

The first mover advantage is in it being the only PoW blockchain which is actually immutable. No amount of fancy features in some alternate chain can displace this reality.

There is no ""better"" blockchain just around the corner. There is Bitcoin, and not-Bitcoin.

&gt; Lightning Network has been too slow to gain adoption

Nonsense.

&gt;  ZK-rollups, optimistic rollups

Kicking the can down the road. No real scalability.

&gt; Blockchain Payments are better solved with stablecoins.

For what? To be a currency? At the top 1 Bitcoin = 1 Bitcoin, the ultimate in stability.

&gt;  Inflation in the USD was very low over the past decade. 

It's steady aka exponential.

&gt;  However, today there are projects gaining major traction, all of which offer similar forms of scarcity. Digital scarcity is constant in some form throughout the industry. Therefore, it is not enough to warrant being the top project by itself.

Bitcoin can not be displaced by some ""better"" Bitcoin. If you believe so, fork the codebase, implement whatever changes you like and see how this fork goes. 

&gt; Other projects are showing up with real useful technology.

Good for them. They're still not Bitcoin.

&gt;  NFT's are very hype-y but long term, their application outside the art world has great potential. BTC has no way to really get involved with these new use cases.

Nonsense. Colored Coins have been a thing for a good while now.

&gt; So there you have it. I'm sure you'll be tempted to tell me I'm an asshole, since you are probably a BTC investor.

And you're wondering why /r/bitcoin deleted this ""101 reasons why Bitcoin will be displaced by some shitcoin""?

&gt; especially compared to its peers.

That's your fundamental mistake. It has no peers.",hru55ae,ry9o8y,/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/ry9o8y/my_bitcoin_thesis_2022_and_beyond/hru55ae/,7,BitcoinMarkets,2022-01-08 22:50:10

DICKTracey,"I think you’re better off thinking about each trade in isolation. Once the trade is completed then you’re back at square one for the next trade. 

First calculate the cost of executing a trade (exchange or miner fees) as a percentage of your position, call it x. 

Now calculate the profit from each trade, call them y1, y2, y3… yn.

Now you need to calculate the profit from just holding from your initial buy, call it z.

Now you need to calculate:
z-((y1-x)+(y2-x)…+(yn-x)) = w

If w is negative, trading is more profitable

if w is positive, holding is more profitable

At the end of the year all you have is your total profit from all trades, be it many or one, and you pay 33% on that profit.

dragracedave,"TL;DR, selling puts is likely your best option atm. 

I haven't traded on deribit, only ledgerX. Are these American or European style options? This is extremely important to know. American options can be exercised at any point before expiration, European options can only be exercised at expiration. 

If it's European options it's definitely riskier, we could have a rally that starts in q2 where BTC runs up to a 6 figure valuation but it drops below your breakeven before you're able to exercise, and your contract will expire worthless. 

I think you need to do some more research tbh bud, not trying to be rude. Especially before risking half a Bitcoin. Gains are unlimited and losses are predefined when purchasing call options- You're paying a premium now to enter a contractual agreement with the option seller that no matter what the price of BTC is, as long as it's above your strike price when you can exercise the option they'll sell you the BTC at a $20k usd valuation. As an example BTC could be worth 200k and you exercise the option and immediately sell the coin, you've paid a $20,700 premium to enter the contract, so you would be left with a $179,300 profit. Or the option could expire worthless, but that's the risk you take with derivatives. 

You could sell puts, and that's not a bad idea right now. BTC seems to have found a good support, and you could get a great premium for puts with volatility being high. Selling puts can't get out of hand quickly. You're entering a contract with the option buyer to buy the BTC at the strike price you sold, no matter the price of the underlying. If BTC stays above your strike, you keep the premium and don't have to do anything else, the option expires worthless (a good thing when you're selling options) 

The only thing that can get you into trouble with options is selling naked calls (where you don't own the underlying, and most brokerages won't let you sell naked calls anyways), that's exposing yourself to unlimited potential losses for a capped potential profit. 

No matter what you do I would wait until after the fed meeting on Wednesday to do anything. That meeting will have BIG impacts on all markets worldwide. They'll go one way or another, quickly.",hty9zzx,sb40nm,/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/sb40nm/breakeven_for_coinmargined_calls/hty9zzx/,3,BitcoinMarkets,2022-01-24 00:18:13

One thing that the alt season of 2021 conclusively showed is that but for a few weird exceptions that could not be foreseen even after applying hindsight, alts are a complete conveyor belt and rarely gain sats across successive cycles. I don't find any of the alt recommendations at the end of 2017 strongly suggesting or even including Doge, MANA, link or BNB.

History usually shows top 100 coins always change, However many of these coins now are well capitalized, have strong devs, have first mover advantage, are a new category creator and have a network effect.

So is this time different?  I had a strong investment thesis for btc and eth starting early summer 2017, this is the first time I’ve been inspired/convicted to invest in defi and maybe a few others.  Some Coins I’m considering are Maker, compound, aave, curve, filecoin .

As well,  what if these coins are the birth of new Fortune 500 like companies?

Comprehensive_Farm_7,"'Is it worth it to build a bot?' - I suspect your expectations are a little out of whack.  Supposing you have all the time in the world - that you made it your full time job, with the information you've given about your level of experience - I'd say you could realistically expect to accomplish something this within maybe a year, but with literally zero experience you will likely encounter a multitude of roadblocks which will shift the goalposts, if you actually want to learn to 'build bots' I'd plan for more like 2 years (if you don't quit from frustration or boredom)

If you are using exchange APIs you would likely need to learn JavaScript, I guess start with JavaScript

If you are wanting to build bots you will probably need to *master* a completely different language than JavaScript, something like Python

You will need to learn to search and read a fucking lot.  In particular technical documentation.  Nobody is going to spend very much time answering questions like these

borger_borger_borger,"If this is something you have been sitting on for just a few days, chances are that your ambitions will be stranded if you start right away. Let it sink in for a while. Every now and then, look up some basic tutorial for whatever language you want to learn. Stuff that shouldn't take more than an hour and then just stop. If after a few months you still feel motivated to learn programming, then fully commit to it.  
  
I'll be honest, programming is difficult to learn and impossible to master. It will take four-ish years of tinkering a few days per week before you are decent enough to take on your own projects that won't fall apart. I have 24 years of experience under my belt and I'm *still* learning.  
  
Ambition is very important in order to learn. You do have one (trading bot), but it is a concerning one. Not only do you need to learn programming, but also be well versed in market data indicators. I'm not talking about successfully implementing the algorithm, but actually understand the literature behind the indicator, in order for your bot to act upon it. I don't want to discourage you from learning, but it might be a path of failure. Try making other bots first just to learn. Some examples:  
- A bot that pings you every time someone posts in the latest daily discussion of /r/BitcoinMarkets.  
- A bot that counts how often Bitcoin is mentioned in the chat of live streams (Twitch, Youtube).  
- A bot that posts a chat message in Discord every time there's 50+ BTC volume traded in the last half hour.  
  
With all of that said, Javascript is what you probably want to know. You'll be able to read exchange data relatively easily with that. The problem is that Javascript is hard to learn *properly* because a lot of programming concepts were introduced to the language only quite recently (search results will be saturated with old techniques). So after familiarizing yourself with the syntax of Javascript, you'll probably want to read up on [ES6 (ECMAScript)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-to-es6/). Don't let the name fool you; it's still Javascript.  
  
All of this Javascript'ing, you'll want to do in Visual Studio Code. There's many other options but just start there, it's free and great. But Javascript doesn't run on it's own. Traditionally it ran in browsers (and it still does), but there's this great engine called NodeJS that will allow you to run it from your command line, or even from Visual Studio Code by simply pressing the F5 button. NodeJS will always strive to support the latest ECMA Script version.  
  
Your search history will primarily consist of the keywords ""NodeJS"" or ""ES6"". Example: ""NodeJS module class"". Do not use ""Javascript"" for intermediate stuff. You will get obsolete examples.

SpontaneousDream,"\[Incoming speculation below\]

I'll start out by saying that I am a huge fan of Vitalik Buterin, like most of us here. The man is brilliant, and I personally pay close attention (from an investment standpoint) in any projects that he legitimately endorses. I also love the rumor mill and I do try to buy the rumor on occasion. Here goes:

Some of you may be aware that Vitalik and Zooko Wilcox (co-founder of Zcash) are good friends. They've known each other for nearly a decade, and Vitalik says [here](https://youtu.be/gcV9KlnW-dc?t=92) ""I've been following the project almost since..even before the start, and I met Zooko for the first time back in 2013 at the first big Bitcoin conference."" [Here](https://twitter.com/88crypt/status/1495123598784167936/photo/1) is a pic of them recently pranking each other at ETHDenver.

In short, they are good friends and frequently give talks together at conferences and both have praised each others ideas, work, and respective coins. Vitalik has talked up Zcash on numerous occasions.

[In this talk here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t62isi58XcQ&amp;t=934s) by Zooko at ETHDenver , he explains from 15:34-17:05 how in the initial creation of Zcash, there were six total participants. After the creation, only *five* identities were revealed, with the last one remaining anonymous as ""John Dobbertin"". You can read up more [here](https://z.cash/technology/paramgen/) on the creation of Zcash.

In short, the Zcash team will reveal in March the final member in the ceremony upon their Halo upgrade (gives Zcash recursive zero-knowledge proofs). **I am speculating now that the final person was Vitalik Buterin.**

This all may be a big nothing burger. Or, it may be something bigger. I'll admit that it is a bit of a speculative leap, but for anyone like myself, it *may* be worth it to get a small bag of ZEC. If Vitalik is indeed the final member of that ceremony, I expect ZEC to pump and I expect a lot more eyes to turn on to Zcash. Cheers all.",hxwyuvs,shmm7g,/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/shmm7g/altcoin_discussion_february_2022/hxwyuvs/,5,BitcoinMarkets,2022-02-22 02:39:58

I agree that there is much money from Middle East and Central Asia that will not like this, but then again, where the hell would you move your money? China? All rich Chinese get their money from china precisely for fears for politcal attachs and accounts freeze.  Dubai? Malta? 

There are very, very few places in the world other than western banks to keep your money safe. Unless you are Russian, Chinese, etc.

Bitcoin surely could be seen as an asset for that, but I worry that the moment it becomes evident that Russia and other countries are using crypto to circumvent swift, USA will make US exchanges to block all transactions to those countries and no longer accept otc and physical wallets.

Admirable_Salad_9982,"That sucks, but here's a few thoughts;

There are likely other reasons in your tax return that they came after you, you said you were a small business owner, that automatically increases your chance of an audit. This also doesn't really apply to anyone who has started using crypto as of \~2017 since pretty much every major service that was available then is still available now and it will be easy to pull transaction history.

But really, you should have known you were fucked when you submitted for a 5 figure refund.

Crypto taxes are simple now, plug your transaction history from every wallet/exchange into an aggregation service like Koinly and it spits out a number, ta-da. As long as you are paying something to the IRS (and not claiming a 5 figure refund) you'll be fine.

This is completely ridiculous. I have like literally hundreds if not thousands of transactions from a wallet to an exchange to another wallet over and over, just the same coins being sent back and forth many times to different places etc. Most of the exchanges no longer exist. If I got audited and each 'send' in my coinbase  history is a sale and each 'receive' is income, I'd be completely bankrupt 10 times over.

sporabolic,"Great post. I'd like to add to it..

Because of bitcoin's deflationary design, it encourages savings... in contrast, a currency whose supply is constantly being inflated loses value in terms of real buying power. If your money is constantly losing buying power you are incentivized to spend it as quickly as possible. 

As soon as people are incentivized to spend money asap to stop the loss of value the market place shifts from a level balance of power to that of a sellers market. Producers of hard goods realize this situation and that there is an elasticity of demand along the curve of quality of goods and so goods of increasingly poor quality are tolerated in the marketplace. As inflation rate increases the store of value proposition steps to the forefront and people are willing to just about buy anything to park their savings in hard assets. On some level Manufacturers know this and it has created this perverse incentive to flood the market with junk, disposable goods, planned obsolescence, unrepairable electronics, cars that brick themselves when you miss an oil change, etc.

If money gained value by just sitting there, it would change incentive structure. Manufacturers would have to offer goods that retain their value over time, instead we have cellphones and cars that can't be repaired and are designed to be thrown away.",i5mzgp3,u8o0dg,/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/u8o0dg/bitcoin_is_our_greatest_weapon_in_the_fight/i5mzgp3/,1,BitcoinMarkets,2022-04-21 16:57:15

Funds will be transferred to the official accounts of the National Bank of Ukraine and allocated by assigned ministries to cover the most pressing needs:

**It is super easy to donate crypto.** You can donate to defense and demining, medical aid, or rebuilding Ukraine. Many cryptos are accepted (there are minimum donation amounts for each coin, but none are more than $30 USD). There is an option to enter your email- don't worry, you don't have to enter it. I had some coin sitting in unused wallets and decided to donate. It's not much, but when everyone donates, it adds up.

OverCaffeinatedFox,"KISS

We're in a bear market, and so is everything it's correlated to (Nasdaq, tech stocks, S&amp;P 500).

Inflation hikes = bearish
Inflation drops = bullish

Global economy headed towards recession, there's a war, everyone got poorer because of the pandemic, so people have less money to dump into the market and make bitty go moon.

Not sure how much bull market support levels will hold in a bear market, nor how relevant predictive models are at predicting how bitcoin's going to react to these new market conditions, considering bitcoin hasn't gone through such conditions before.

As for technicals, way below bull market support band (20 week SMA), got rejected recently by the 200 day SMA, bottoms of prior bear markets touched the 200 week SMA (dubious extrapolation here, but currently sitting at roughly 22k).

At best?  Bearish and expecting support at possibly 28k.  At worst? Idk, much lower maybe? In 10 years?  Probably much better outlook",i7l5ahy,ujrr5x,/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/ujrr5x/why_i_am_bullish/i7l5ahy/,18,BitcoinMarkets,2022-05-06 18:45:22

Mayneminu,"If your time frame is this week, sure, you can be 'bullish'. A small bounce for a yet another weekly lower high is possible. 

But let's be clear, after testing and failing miserably to sustain prices above 43k, we are breaking out of a range support that has held since Jan. 

What is happening is MUCH bigger than crypto.We are already seeing forced selling in all areas of the market. BTC is not immune to this. Infact, the highest beta names are the first to go to raise cash. Do not underestimate the amount of leverage in the system not just in futures, but in Defi. (This is to say nothing of the broader market leverage that's built up over the past 14 years of QE)

I'm highly confident 33k will be broken and along with it, many holders that have only been around for the past 2 years will finally capitulate puke there holdings. The only doubt is wether the real whales step in in size there or wait for sub 30k.",i7o4pul,ujrr5x,/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/ujrr5x/why_i_am_bullish/i7o4pul/,3,BitcoinMarkets,2022-05-07 12:25:40

SpontaneousDream,"Pretty brutal capitulation going on now. I think we're going to see a LOT of alts lose 80% or more of their value from ATH, if they haven't already. Some will drop even further into the -90% range. It's pretty much that 2018 crash all over again.

I am of course buying BTC and ETH, but it's very hard to make a case for buying the **vast** majority of alts right now. There are still so many coins with huge market caps that are either scams, vaporware, or just massively overvalued.

Also notice the BTC ratio on altcoins. BTC dominance is climbing rapidly.

RecycIops,Ok so figured this might be the best place to have a soundboard for the word vomit in my head regarding stable coins. It seems like stablecoins primarily exist for people to exit any sort of volatile asset without having to park in fiat (I’d assume mainly due to KYC and tax avoidance). Isn’t the perfect solution quite simple? Create an exchange that allows for users to exchange Bitcoin or any other crypto asset into a stable coin that the exchange owns (call it Peg) and the exchange just immediate liquidates the asset exchanged (Bitcoin) for cash and gives the equal value of cash in Peg to the user? Am I missing something when it comes to stable coins and how they function? It seems like everyone is trying to invent some innovative way to provide a stable coin when it seems like the simpler the better. Tether has withstood all the FUD because it’s backed by cash like highly liquid assets. I just feel like this whole situation is a result of people trying too hard to reinvent the wheel,i8edqza,ufrja9,/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/ufrja9/altcoin_discussion_may_2022/i8edqza/,2,BitcoinMarkets,2022-05-13 01:59:39
SpontaneousDream,"For reference, the UST/Luna collapse was by market cap a larger collapse than Lehman Brothers back in 2008, which was a $50 billion dollar collapse. When you think about this compared to the overall size of the crypto market, you get an idea of just how massive this was. Easily the biggest collapse in crypto history, and we just witnessed it in real time. 

You know what though? So much of this could have been avoided. This exact same death spiral happened to Iron Finance last year. The used a nearly identical stabilizing mechanism. Further, I, along with many investors and traders- both experienced and not- have been sounding the alarm bells since the beginning. There were red flags *all over* this thing. The stabilization mechanism, the bizarre behavior of Do Kwon, the buying of additional BTC as collateral, the frankly ludicrous APY to reel unsuspecting people in....the list goes on.

Words of advice, to EVERYONE: 

1. If something sounds too good to be true, it probably is. 
2. Avoid unbacked, algorithmic stablecoins. 
3. Nothing is too big too fail. 
4. Crypto is still *extremely* risky. This is yet another reminder why. Know how to assess the risk, and don't let your emotions blind you. 
5. Never put in more than you can afford to lose. 

For what it's worth, this is coming from someone who has been here for a long time. I have lost money, made money, missed opportunities, gotten lucky, tried out everything under the sun, and have witnessed all kinds of bizarre, crazy shit go down. 

And yet, I still come back. It's been a hell of a rollercoaster ride, but I'm not getting off any time soon. Just know that when you're on this rollercoaster, you NEED to prepare and do things to protect yourself (see points 1-5).",i8eo6dz,ufrja9,/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/ufrja9/altcoin_discussion_may_2022/i8eo6dz/,31,BitcoinMarkets,2022-05-13 03:23:03

The funds you “won” never existed at all.  In the case of fraudulent trading sites it’s a last ditch attempt to steal more of your money.  Any funds you’ve deposited already are long gone.

KaiserTom,"Discounts and premiums are typically controlled by the market. People, even you, quite literally exchange BTC with the ETF and receive shares in return, or you can exchange the shares for BTC. Arbitrage occurs from this and the price of the ETF corrects.

If the ETF trades at a discount to the asset, you can exchange shares of the ETF for the asset, which is worth more, pushing price of the ETF shares back up. If the ETF trades at a premium to the asset, you can exchange the asset for ETF worth more than the asset.

For a prolonged period, this just implies the shares of the ETF are generally considered worth less than it's asset. For BTC, transaction costs make this sort of arbitrage expensive except in large amounts. Since BTC is the higher value asset, the ETF takes the discount since less people want it over BTC.",i9vzun1,ux57i0,/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/ux57i0/how_are_discounts_resolved_on_bitcoin_etfs/i9vzun1/,2,BitcoinMarkets,2022-05-25 02:44:11

I'm a big picture guy. I plan in longer timeframes. I do well when I fully commit to a plan, and I usually regret when I don't.

Mark my words: in 2024, and especially in 2025, we're going to see people wishing they'd bought more when prices were lower. Well prices are lower now, so I'm buying and holding.

Buy low, sell high.

Between now and the next halving, I'm probably going to say the same thing a thousand different ways: Buy low. Is the price down? Yeah? THAT'S WHEN YOU BUY.  It's amazing how many people only want to buy when the price is high. I don't understand that at all.

I expect 2022 and 2023 to be down years. How far down? I don't know. Worst case scenario, I hope we hold 20k, but there are so many variables that could push us lower OR that could have us climb. So I look at the bigger picture. I say to myself ""Where do I expect Bitcoin to be a year after the next halving?"" ...the more we're under that, the more I feel confident when I buy.

Calebkeller2,"As a SMC trader, it does not surprise me in the slightest.  In order to get the price to 29k in the first place, aggressive sellers have to absorb the bids all the way down.

The *only* way to do such a thing is by injecting fear into retail traders' minds.  If you're good enough at reading between the lines, this has been happening over the past two years with the onset of Covid-19, and an eminent war and it's associated repercussions.  You can also look into the ideology of changing world order.

Now does it seem all that odd that during this crescendo of fear, the price of the futures currency is suffering naturally?  Or is it more likely that it is being manipulated by the composite operator, in order to accumulate a larger position?  It is obvious that banks and companies will begin accepting it, as it has already begun happening.

Lastly, the current top three holders of bitcoin hold a combined 650k BTC.  Before the last ""pump"" the same three holders held a collective \~690k BTC.

Hannibaalism,"Youre assuming the ratio of the returns (second derivative) will continue to increase by assuming a constant third derivative (1.13). In real world time series data, anything beyond the second derivative usually approaches randomness from a practical perspective, i.g. it swings wildly from positive to negative, etc.. So a (slightly) better estimate would be to do a regression on multiple second derivatives, but since theres only 2 points I think an avg. would be closer to reality.

The implied ratio of the returns of the fourth bull run to the fifth bull run would then be (4.86 +   5.51)  /  2 = 5.185, returns on the fifth bull run would then be 21.9 / 5.185 = 4.22,  the high for the fifth bull run will be 17607.69 \* 4.22= 74304.45

Even this estimate is probably off, because we are extrapolating using only two data points. In reality we can go below 4.86 just as easily as going above 5.51. This is precisely why we get **dimishing** returns, i.e. the ratio of returns should asymptotically approach 0.",idc96k4,vhw3va,/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/vhw3va/real_fud_question_longterm/idc96k4/,5,BitcoinMarkets,2022-06-22 19:22:12

AnilWang,"Here's the story, TA is a lot like algorithmic stable coins in that they were meant to be broken. If few people use a particular indicator, the indicator might be accurate, but if everyone uses a particular indicator, the everyone will act in such a way as to maximize their profit, thus invalidating the indicator. If ""a lot of people"" are using an indicator, then whales will use that knowledge to invalidate the indicator at the last minute and buy when the TA says sell and sell when the TA says buy just to get shrimps into short or long squeezes to avoid being margin called, thus increasing their profits. 

IMO, it's more important to look at the macro since you can't fake reality. Once you know the macro (e.g. the first stress may be 1 week away), if most TA agrees with the macro, the TA will be especially clear, even if there's manipulation attempts.

Rebellion111,"OP Sorry this sub doesn't want to talk about trading anymore, I guess its mostly hodlers who don't have the courage to attempt trading, or failed and now just hodl.

For indicators, I recommend you learn about the ones that you can agree with but don't use them to determine your trades. Put them on your charts, study them, watch how they work and then you'll have a much better understanding of how to use them. This is why some traders say ""watching the charts"" is important. You can't just get an alert on your phone to buy/sell anytime to RSI hits a certain point, a lot more important context is needed, the RSI is always secondary.

99% of technical indicators have shown to not really work as predictors. Most of them are lagging indicators, used to confirm/deny your initial bias. E.g. You bought btc because it dipped and the RSI hit 40 on it's way down and you think there might be a bounce. So over the next few candles, say they were sideways, you can monitor the changes in RSI to help you confirm/deny movement. RSI goes up from 40 and thats a signal for you to stay in the trade. RSI continues lower, signal to cut losses and get out.

Just google which technical indicators actually work and you'll see most people just stick to MACD or some form of RSI or Moving Averages. I would highly suggest you choose an indicator that fits your needs, and you need to know exactly what those needs are and how the indicator can help. Additionally, indicator settings are completely up to the user and this further muddies the water on their effectiveness. 

Price action and volume are your best indicators. Only use others to ""see what other people are thinking"" so you can get an edge over those traders. Learn some candlestick patterns, every pattern will have nuance and should be viewed in the context of something more broad.",if8znxc,vtj9kw,/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/vtj9kw/losing_my_mind_trying_to_figure_out_which/if8znxc/,2,BitcoinMarkets,2022-07-07 19:53:08

escendoergoexisto,"Which indicators to use? 

1. Develop skills with a lot of indicators. Study them, backtest them, use them, etc. Btw—Since there are so many, no one can be highly effective with all of them so simply dismiss some that are a struggle for you to understand. Also, keep tabs on which indicators the best traders you know tend to use most. 

2. While most all traders have 4 or 5 go to indicators that they’re always using, the best traders learn that whales sometimes use those same indicators to outperform you and take from your stack. My solution to this challenge is to backtest indicators that I have, and haven’t, been using recently to see which ones have been best predicting the current market conditions and then place a greater degree of emphasis on those. Various indicators will pretty much always be giving differing signals, so the challenge is choosing the best tools for the current trading (job) conditions at hand.",ifdqyxh,vtj9kw,/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/vtj9kw/losing_my_mind_trying_to_figure_out_which/ifdqyxh/,1,BitcoinMarkets,2022-07-08 19:14:15

DU09,"Here are my tips after some good years of experience:

1. Focus on price action first and volume. These are your best indicators. Make sure you know your resistance/support levels
2. 99% of indicators are derivatives of price / volume, hence see 1 
3. Choose max 3 indicators, say RSI, MACD, OBV, and stick with them for a few months
4. Do not change your indicators every day, you need to get used to your indicators and see what works best for you then adjust 
5. There is no indicator that is ""best"" they all serve a different purpose
6. Seek confluences and maximize your probability to win i.e. sell resistance, buy support
7. A good trade is one where you did all according to your plan, win or lose 
8. Focus on executing good trades, NOT making money, that comes as a consequence of good trades
9. No indicator will save you from poor emotional plays, seek to control those: FUD, FOMO, GREED
10. The market is the best teacher/always right and it will always give you new opportunities
11. Not trading is also a position
12. Use a SL, don't leverage, and expect to lose in the first 2 years
13. Make sure you understand different timeframes and zoom out first 
14. Be kind to yourself, the learning curve takes time

OverCaffeinatedFox,"Personally, I use MFI, RSI, and some moving averages (10, 20, 50) on daily and weekly timeframes.  I also pay attention to support and resistance levels, use trend lines, fibs, and guage a move based on volume, volatility, and price action.

Risk management is key.  Every time I open a position, I set my stop losses and take profits based on support and resistance level, macro outlook, etc.  If I'm uncertain, I either don't take the trade, or take a smaller position.  

You don't have to use your whole portfolio to trade or hold, you can do both.  Currently, I'm trading with 20% of my portfolio.  Probably won't touch that 80% until at least the halving, but will still trade the other 20%.

chuck_portis,"Couple notes from previous bear markets...

Chasing the same alts that outperformed during the previous bull market tends to be the wrong strategy.  Some exceptions of course.  LTC performed amazingly in 2017.  ETH performed amazingly in 2021.  But there's many examples on the other side.

DASH.  XLM.  Feathercoin??  Namecoin???  Many of the successful altcoins from 2021 will never see their highs again.  Many will never come close.  The environment will be different if/when we have another bull market.  Who could have predicted SOL or AVAX in 2017?  They didn't exist.  

Traditionally, it's better to wait these bear markets out in BTC.  You could probably say BTC or ETH at this point.  These two are firmly cemented as the ""blue chips"".  There is no need to go alt picking right now.  We don't know what the environment will be in the next bull market.  We don't know what the tech will look like.  

Resist the urge to buy alts because ""They're down so much from ATH!""  There is no supply constraint on alts.  There will always be new technology and new platforms.  There will always be a new shiny layer 1, or a new layer 2 solution built on ETH/BTC.  It's much harder for the existing platforms to innovate than it is for a new platform to launch with fresh tech.",ih5ag36,vorffe,/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/vorffe/altcoin_discussion_july_2022/ih5ag36/,20,BitcoinMarkets,2022-07-22 04:05:11
pg3crypto,"What you have discovered is the trap almost all day traders fall into.

You're trading a pair but only watching the $ value.

You should ignore the $ value and focus on stacking one side of the pair or the other.

For example, on the 12th July Ethereum bottomed out against Bitcoin, if you wanted to stack sats at that point you would swap some BTC for ETH. Let's say you bought 2ETH with BTC (which would have cost about 0.054btc per Eth) then you waited a week, you'd have been able to get your original BTC back plus an extra 0.03-0.04btc (approx $600-$700). A 30-40% profit on your original position.

Now go and look at the ETHBTC chart, note where Eth was and where it is now. There is still room for it to climb against BTC.

Don't try and time the market, just wait for things to happen. I always set my targets based on entry and exit prices. If you're in profit and you like it, take it. If it's worth the risk and the time. Take it.

Its unlikely we're going to crash significantly further over the next 180 days. The market low has previously been ~530 days before halving, which means that now to the end of Oct is your pre-halving low.

TheBlissFox,"I take the fact that the market just recently had a very red day and btc held up pretty well at just under 20k as a pretty strong indicator that the bottom is fairly solid. It is by no means certain, but a strong indicator nonetheless. There are also other good correlations, such as a very high percentage (63%) of existing BTC hasn’t moved in almost two years. Those last two years were a doozy so these appear to be long term hodlers. I’d feel safe buying rn, in fact I’d feel like I just missed the bottom at ~17-18k but still have a chance at getting in low… for now. If we ever hit below 10k again that’s when I’d actually be worried about the future of btc in general. For now, anything between 17k-24k is a great deal in my opinion.

I do know that for me the IRS claimed that some Crypto Options that I bought and sold had a cost basis of $0 and wanted me to pay $10k. I sent them a statement from my broker showing that it was actually negative and they were fine with that.

But very scary.

ChadRun04,"&gt; decentralized

Nothing about the decentralisation of Bitcoin suggests that it must behave unlike every other asset. It's not ""decentralised"" as in ""disconnected from reality"", but decentralised as in no central authority.

&gt; inflation and all that stock market shit

Inflation is a consequence of monetary policy where new fiat currency is printed.

Stock market, is a market.

&gt; crypto follows the highs and lows of the stock market.

**Everything** is following the whims of central bankers for the moment. They're changing the value of money.

&gt; has it always been like this?

Like what?

&gt; what changed?

Politicians used the fear of COVID to gain more power for themselves. The power was bought with printed money. The printed money broke the global economy.

RylNightGuard,"&gt;Isn't it part of the whole point of being a ""decentralized "" currency is its immunity to inflation and all that stock market shit?

I mean, in principle decentralization, inflation, and correlation to the stock market have nothing to do with each other

A decentralized crypto can be inflationary or deflationary - depends on the system and algorithm that mints new ones. What can't happen in most cryptos is some centralized actor just deciding to print more at a whim

Correlation to the stock market is down to the behaviour of big institutional money and emotional retail, since crypto has become an asset for huge price speculation

I'd guess that crypto might eventually decouple from other markets, but it will take a big rise in adoption relative to speculation to make that happen",iseeblu,y4844r,/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/y4844r/why_does_bitcoin_tend_to_crash_with_the_stock/iseeblu/,1,BitcoinMarkets,2022-10-15 10:01:28

NFT_fud,"Generally speaking there has been this hippie/nerd daydream of decentralization, breaking out of corrupt trad-fi, a universal currency not controlled by governments etc.  The only problem with these hippie/nerds (bless their hearts) is that it relied on everyone getting together around the campfire and singing kumbaya in agreement.  If

So they open the doors to these blockchains, Defi and say ""here you go, play nice kids, pinky swear you wont do anything bad""  and every goddamned scammer, trader, VCs, banks, hedge  fund, ego maniac showed up and did whatever the f$#k they. To some whale traders just see Crypto as a cute little sand box. Considering big traders like JP morgan manipulated the shit out the metals market (gold alone has a $10T market cap)for 8 years and no regulations ?

In may 2021 crash it was clear that a wyckoff trading pattern (google it) was used on the market to shake out investors and it did. Who invented Wyckoff ? JPMorgan. They may not have done this but someone did. Also JP Morgan was in Crypto deeper then anyone knew and at the same time the FUD master Jamie Dimon told everyone it was a bad investment, dont do it.  There is all kinds of Wash trading going on. Some big stock market traders would jump in and out, shorting, longing based on setups etc

Not to mention all the shenanigans mentioned by others in the post, all of which are true more or less.

""Unbank yourself"" is a PR scam that Machinsky (Celsius) exploited to unbank your money right into his pocket, there is no such thing, the hippie/daydream never happened. Banks, Funds, traders are balls deep into Crypto, they have re-banked crypto, crypto is their little B$tch.

monkeyhold99,"Where to even begin...

**Losers:**

1. FTX is obviously totally done for, including [FTX.US](https://FTX.US). WSJ reporting SEC investigation. Considering FTX's size and reputation, this is far worse than Luna/UST, Celsius, 3AC, Voyager, etc. The question now is how far does the FTX contagion go? Who else is wrapped up in this? That's what the market is trying to gauge now, and the uncertainty is destroying prices and confidence.
2. FTT and SOL. FTT down 95%, likely not long until it gets to $0. SOL also totally wrecked, down 95% as well. Even aside from price, I'm not sure Solana is going to make it out of this given how much FTX/SBF propped them up. The big question here is if they are tied into this somehow as well, and how much SBF/FTX or others in the contagion have propped them up.
3. Confidence &amp; trust. This is going to scare away potential investors for years to come or possibly longer. Not to mention that the chances of reactive/over-extended regulation are now higher, which could set the space back. Very hard to see how this part will play out.

**Winners? Sort of?**

1. DeFi. Likely a larger migration and support for DeFi options since CeFi trust is now at the lowest its been since Gox days.
2. CZ/Binance. They gain even more control over the market with the elimination of their largest competitor.",ivq8gn7,yiy5pz,/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/yiy5pz/altcoin_discussion_november_2022/ivq8gn7/,8,BitcoinMarkets,2022-11-09 20:33:39

FinancialDiplomat,"I have been thinking lately about the meaning of altcoin's BTC ratio.

The general consensus is that the ratio pops once or like twice per cycle for altcoins, then it bottoms out.

With BNB's ratio gradually growing and growing, I have realized that a growing ratio does not imply overvalue of a coin but rather strength (for very few selected coins).

And I think ETH is next with settling at a ratio above 0.1 long term, and dethroning BTC from the no1 spot in marketcap. The way ETH's ratio is constantly consolidating above 0.07 instead of naturally gravitating towards 0.05 and below makes me assume this.",iw39qwp,yiy5pz,/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/yiy5pz/altcoin_discussion_november_2022/iw39qwp/,6,BitcoinMarkets,2022-11-12 17:00:07

cocofolio,"assume all exchanges will fail at some point. So you never should have anything on the exchange beyond the 5-7 days of holding period after you buy your coins.

Assuming you take x% from your paycheck to buy coin, wait till the money clears, transfer out the coin, before you buy more again. So your biggest loss should something happen in those 5-7 days is that one small chunk from one paycheck. It's annoying but not life threatening.

If you are buying a large chunk (say from a bonus) you need to space out your buys.  buy 1/10 or 1/5, move it out, then send more cash in and buy another 1/10 or 1/5. Never put the whole thing in at once if it's large.
