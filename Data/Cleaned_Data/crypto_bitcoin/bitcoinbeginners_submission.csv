I’m in it for the long term when it comes to BTC for sure. Binance seems to be a great trading platform so far, I know people complain about the large withdrawal fees but I don’t plan on withdrawing any cash for a long time. Just think of using the profits from your crypto trades to put back into trades and by the time you withdraw it you should have a large enough portion that the fees wouldn’t be much of a concern.

Also a big favor - if theres any experienced cryptobros in here that are kind enough to help me out, calculate for me the following hypothetical transaction: Let's say I bought 0.25BTC right now which is 11725$, it jumped by 5% by monday and I decide I want to cash out my investment.

ruox4y,mosilein,40,https://redd.it/ruox4y,None,What to tell that non tech-savvy friend ?,"We all have them, we all know one. 

As we are approaching more and more adaptability people hear about everything crypto and wanna jump on the bandwagon to make a quick buck. 

I had a friend approach me recently about Bitcoin: ""have been thinking about it for a while now. I see people on Facebook talking about it. I want to put some savings into it.""

I am new to it as well but only felt comfortable after a good month of research to put my first couple bucks into BTC. It does take energy and time (at least for me) to get to a point where I felt like, ok now I fucking get it. Guess what tho, that is only the surface of it all and I know that. What I'm getting at is that it is exciting to me. Not just the money aspect.

Now I have this friend who wants to get into it for the purpose of getting something a bit more out of their savings than just having it rot on a bank account. Fair enough. Who doesn't. I want to be helpful but I know that their technical know-how doesn't  exceed the I know how to turn my iPhone on and off  and god forbid it doesn't connect to the Bluetooth speaker right away. Their  self-admitted frustration with anything tech related that doesn't work out right away is a major red flag in my opinion.

I just don't think that you can purchase and store Bitcoin safely right now if you are not willing to put the work in to understand it. Not just the tech behind it but also things like how do I navigate the internet as privately/safe as one can ect. 

I know that their is no need for trust when it comes to blockchain and Bitcoin  because everything is verifiable. If you are not able to or unwilling to learn how to verify you should not own Bitcoin.

rv9s9o,eghdizzle,37,https://redd.it/rv9s9o,None,51% attack but with nodes instead of hashpower,"Hello, I've recently been doing some reading on how the basics of the whole bitcoin network and I have a question regarding a possible 51% exploit. So I know that it would be extremely hard to create mutliply blocks in succession before someone else posts another block. If it would be possible I could exploit the double spending problem, since my chain would be accepted as the new ""true"" chain by all the nodes, due to it being longer. This exploit is prevented by the huge amount of hashpower that would be necessary for me to create multiple blocks in succession, before anyone else can compute only one single block. So far so good.

My question now concerns the number of nodes. There are less than 100.000 full nodes currently running. As far as I understand it, full nodes are the ones that store the ledger and the ones that verify transactions, i.e. new blocks. Couldn't I just run a ton of nodes (since a nodes are super cheap/easy to operate) that would make up more than 50% of all full nodes in operation right now. Then I could just proclaim a manipulated version of the ledger to be the new ""correct"" ledger since I have more than 51% of all nodes? 

Is the problem maybe with generating such a fake ledger since generating it would almost be equivalent to mining...? I'm really not sure where the mistake in my reasoning is in the above. Maybe someone can help me understand. Thank you!",2,bitcoinbeginners,2022-01-03 19:28:45

rwhtv2,H4m_S4ndw1ch,23,https://redd.it/rwhtv2,None,Help! Major bug with blockchain.com wallet,"Hey everyone!

I just had a major issue with my [blockchain.com](https://blockchain.com) wallet a few hours ago. I am trying to figure out what went wrong. It seems to be a bug on their end. I am panicking quite a bit here as I am missing a substantial amount of BTC. (Basically an annual salary)

Earlier today, I sent myself an amount of 'x' BTC from an exchange wallet to my blockchaincom wallet.  A few hours later, I sent a much smaller 'y' amount of BTC to a friend from this same blockchaincom wallet. My friend received the funds without issue. Here is the problem on my end. The change address, which is always auto generated after every transaction, has received the unspent BTC (or 'change') but it is not showing in my account.Also, for every other transaction I have done using this wallet, the change address always has a little circle next to it with an 'i' in it and when you hover over it, it states, ""The change address belongs to your wallet"".The last transaction's change address (for 'y' BTC tx) did not have this circle. Thus, we can easily conclude that, somehow, this change address is not tied to my wallet.

In other words, it appears my blockchaincom wallet generated a change address which I do not control. I feel like I should be able to recover the funds using my seed but I am panicking and I have not tried yet.I assume the private key for this wallet address has to be somewhere.

I have contacted [blockchain.com](https://blockchain.com) support but I have not heard back from them yet.There is CLEARLY an issue on their end. Buggy software perhaps? I dont understand how a change address can be automatically generated and not tied to the wallet that sent the tx. Has anyone heard of anything like this happening before??I have done 100s of transactions with this wallet for many years without any issues. I have been searching online for hours trying to find some similar cases. I have only found a handful. I do not understand what could have gone wrong.

Hopefully that made sense. I am in a fog of anxiety and, I am not going to lie, quite a bit of anger. I would appreciate it if anyone can be of assistance, I really need help! 

Thanks!!  
\--------------------------  
(I was not sure where to post this so my apologies in advance if it was not an appropriate post for this subreddit.)  


\*EDIT\*   
It has now been resolved. There was definitely a bug of some sort. The transaction is now appearing as normal, I have access to the change address and the funds are in my wallet. I cannot describe the relief I am feeling at the moment.  
No one from blockchain has responded to my ticket or gotten into contact with me yet, so I am not sure if this was autocorrected or if someone manually did something to fix it. I would still like to understand what happened here.

I will be moving my funds elsewhere. This was an eye opening experience!

rx2455,Mallardshead,21,https://redd.it/rx2455,None,Bitcoin's final eclipse on gold.,"Most gold is held by central banks. Even though gold standards are mostly dead, gold is still their hard asset of choice--because they control it. Gold is an asset that is way too hard for fiat, so it’s critical the price is held in check and manipulated relentlessly, because if it reached escape velocity, it would greatly demonetize their power, wreck price controls, and render their inflationary systems mostly effete. It’s important that the amounts any central bank holds is never actually known (wether that’s less or more than they say), and it’s important that ownership of a majority (in a central bank’s country, and the world at large) is always maintained. You can’t manipulate large assets effectively if you don’t own a majority of them, or a majority of the infrastructure that supports them (preferably both). That’s what we’ve seen with gold, what OPEC does to Brent oil, what packers do to beef prices, etcetera. Otherwise you’d end up in a situation where your exposure is like a naked call or naked put. A single outsized price move in either direction can leave you bankrupt or ruined. With majority ownership, your ability to leak an asset onto the open market becomes powerful, as does collusion. Your ability to exploit derivatives also becomes a viable tool. You can move it up or down, as circumstances demand. But remember, gold can’t go too low either, otherwise it destabilizes other parts of their monetary scheme.

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London\_Gold\_Pool](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Gold_Pool)

Here’s what Peter Schiff, legacy governments, and academic economics can't see yet:

Gold is the open vector of attack that bitcoin will exploit and use to demonetize the political class.

If a single country (it doesn’t have to be a large one) decides that holding gold is not worth it, and bitcoin is better, all hell breaks loose. And in this Squid Game, the first country out the door, wins. Consider: if this single country put their gold on the open market, it would spook the price, and the wave of contagious fear it brought, would snowball. This would produce an incredibly pernicious environment for the weakest currencies, and when those start imploding, many others cascade with them. The cost to hedge further gold downside would quickly get out of reach as well, because the beta (premium) on options and futures protection would rocket enough to put a hole through heaven's ivory floorboards, where the Bagdanoff twins (RIP) are waiting. So if you're a country holding gold, anxiously watching this drawdown, you have essentially one of two immediate choices: buy the gold that other countries are selling, or exit, making certain not to be the last fool out the door. Because if another country decided to offload even part of their reserves, there's really no telling where the well's bottom splashes.

What hard asset do they acquire then? There are none but bitcoin. It’s become a Schelling Point. But that's a problem, because for the amount countries need to keep their monetary Ponzi scheme’s going, they’re late.

You see, 90% of the coins have already been mined. All of them are already owned (or lost). The last 10% will take 140 years to mine. And the majority of the coinbase (block rewards) will be HODLed by miners. What that means directionally for any entity needing majority control isn’t good. And it leaves one place for them to acquire bitcoin: the open free market...meaning you're in trouble. If you're not first out the door, the price and volatility will get out of hand, and the more money you print to try catching it, the higher it will go. Bitcoin becomes a margin call on fiat. It’s significantly harder than gold, and after the next halving, its stock-to-flow will be considerably scarcer than gold’s. But bitcoin isn’t constrained by borders. Its distribution is exact (block every 10 minutes, 6.25 coinbase, inflation reset every 4 years). It’s resistant to seizure. Resistant to change. And with the LN moves at the speed of light and settles instantly. Academic economists are confused by it because it combines many things it shouldn’t be able to into one singularity, which given enough time and maturity, produces a complete vertically integrated monetary system.

I'm sure a few countries will try 6102 style attacks, which won’t work, because BIP’s like OP\_CHECKTEMPLATEVERIFY, along with non-custodial wallet evolution will make those a fruitless endeavor.

*\*Executive Order 6102 was when Franklin Delano Roosevelt seized gold and outlawed its sale.*

Any illusions that countries trie creating with gold reserves get shattered. Many still use this as collateral to borrow from other nations. Turkey’s gold reserves for example, are enormous (#10 in world just behind India, or so they say) and this along with their strategic geography are the only things saving the Lira from collapse. Their gold has afforded them bargaining power. Imagine if the value of that stockpile was drawn, quartered, and halved.

Authoritarians will have nothing to fall back on if their fiat goes hyper. They can’t fund wars or aggression anymore. All they have is fiat, and invading a country for their gold and oil doesn’t work, as gold has been demonetized and oil is priced in bitcoin (save this point for another time). They’ll have no access to the hardest asset. If they want to borrow that, they’ll need a functional and trustworthy legal system, and the collateral surrendered up front will be enormous, 50% spot value of the borrowed coinage.

Prediction:

Nation state gold dumping can’t be done quietly anymore. It will be individual investors out the door first (as we’re seeing currently). It will be hedge funds and country’s planning on dumping that acquire the cheap puts. It will be Taiwan that dumps their gold and gets the party started. The US and Germany have enormous gold exposure (#1 and #2 respectively), but luckily their citizens also have enormous bitcoin exposure (#1 and #2 respectively), and both have a mining industry with parabolic hashrates. Switzerland will follow Taiwan out the door. Anyone that dumps afterwards will do so at a rolling 50%-75% discount. It’ll stabilize around $500/ounce as derivatives catch up and premiums collapse, and it’s likely silver flips gold's market cap (30% of silver is used in green energy projects and that percentage might double in the next decade) on its way to oblivion.

So as you stare at the price of a bitcoin which has fallen from $47k to $42k today and contemplate the capital sin of distributing your coins out of fear, consider the power you’re willingly ceding. Bitcoin is an IQ test.",2,bitcoinbeginners,2022-01-06 01:03:55

I'd like to purchase BTC to hang on to - I only intend to purchase and transfer to a cold wallet for long term storage. I've read the beginner FAQs, but would like some additional input from the community please.

1. Purchase the BTC online from an exchange (I don't know anyone personally that I can purchase p2p from).

* If I live in the US, which is the best exchange/platform to use to purchase BTC (approx. $1k-$3k)?
* Are there better avenues to purchase rather than an online exchange?
* Are there steps needed to remain anonymous?

2. Purchase a cold wallet directly from the manufacturer.

* Which is/are the best wallets for my purposes? I'm not particularly savvy with all the technical capabilities of each wallet, I'd like something that is dependable - won't need much maintenance and is easy to use, most importantly secure.

3. Transfer the BTC from the exchange to my cold wallet.

* If anyone can provide me with a dummy guide or a link to performing this step, I'd appreciate it. 
* I read posts talking about BIP and lighting and etc, what are the main things for me to read up on as far as my simple intentions?

&#x200B;

I feel like I understand the concepts but get lost in the details. I guess the best way to learn more is to dive in, I just want to avoid making easily avoidable mistakes.

I have a coinbase account and sent some BTC to a non-profit I wanted to support. I noticed there were fees related to the transaction and this surprised me.

1. Is it a flat fee for any transaction, or is it it a percentage? Is there a max limit to the fees?
2. I sent BTC from my wallet to a non-profit. Coinbase was part of the eqution. Is there some way I could have sent BTC from A to B without incurring fees?

I plan, of course, to store the passphrase somewhere safe. So I wanted to ask you, even after storing the 12 or 24 word passphrase, how likely is it the hot wallet provided by a particular website could be hacked quite easily?",11,bitcoinbeginners,2022-01-13 22:43:43
s3ewo3,Defy-Trends,34,https://redd.it/s3ewo3,None,How does inflation affect Bitcoin?,"Let's talk about inflation and it’s direct impact on Bitcoin. The current inflation rate is \~6,8-7%.

**The inflation rate is rising, and this December’s rate was the highest since June 1982.** 

If prices grow by 7% per year, **this means that in 10 years, all goods will become \~2 times more expensive.** You can say that rising salaries offset inflation, but this is not the case because they have grown by only 4.7% this year.

The Federal Reserve System (FRS) says that as soon as the problems with the supply chains caused by the Coronavirus are resolved, the situation will stabilize. Still, the new variant of Omicron is exacerbating the situation the Coronavirus is progressing.

Due to these events, the dollar is becoming weaker. **If we look at the USD/BTC chart, we can see that the dollar gets weaker against bitcoin; therefore, Crypto enthusiasts often talk about bitcoin as a hedge against inflation.**",13,bitcoinbeginners,2022-01-14 01:00:21

I've also had a quick look at the Google Spreadsheet shared here comparing different wallets. I see discrepancies between all these sources and am a bit confused.

Electrum: I saw in a recent thread that Electrum was discouraged in the comments saying that it's closed source, but wallet scrutiny states it as having a reproducible build as of some months ago and the Electrum website points to a GitHub repo with the source code.

BlueWallet: This seemed like an open source, non-corporate option, but walletscrutiny says not to trust it because it seems like it's a custodial wallet (didn't understand the details here because the app itself doesn't say anything about it being custodial).

BRD: I had previously considered BRD, but seeing that it's been acquired by Coinbase, that makes me uncomfortable.

Blockstream Green: The last one in my consideration is Blockstream Green. It's got a good rating on walletscrutiny, has cross platform clients, and its own version of MultiSig where one key is stored on Blockstream's servers is not something I need. I'm fine with the single sig wallet type that it provides. Yet, what makes me uncomfortable is that I need to accept some terms of service before creating the wallet, and there's a company behind it.

Here are my questions:

1. Can someone please elaborate with details and the latest information on these? The primary platform I'm mainly looking for is a smartphone (since they have app sandboxing and better controls). It'd be nice if it's also available on PC/Mac OSes. I'd like to have the flexibility of integrating with a hardware wallet in the future (i.e., restore this wallet using the seed phrase to another if necessary for the hardware wallet integration).
2. In the recommended option(s), what wallet type and seed phrase options should I choose for being future proof (I don't want to keep moving BTC across my wallets and incurring the network fees for that)?

Tag 1, side 1 - 48 Characters (numbers and letters), all uppercase and over five columns.

Tag 1, side 2 - weird symbol. Almost looks like a diamond with a cross through it inside a broken box.

Tag 2, side 2 - strange pattern of 1s and 0s with additional lines to make it look like trees and mountains. It looks very familiar and reminded me of a previous puzzle I saw somewhere but can’t think of where it was.

I'm interested in using cold storage wallets and am debating going with [Blockstream Jade](https://blockstream.com/jade/) as I really only purchase Bitcoin as of the moment. I think I want to utilize Multisig as I take my security very seriously, and want the best, most secure way to store crypto safely.

  
*My Question/Scenario:*

What happens if you have Multisig setup, lets say via BlockStreams Green software coupled with Jade for a 2-2 signature, and someone steals/captures your seed phrase.

* Can they still steal/access/transfer your crypto out of the cold wallet even though you have a Multisig setup?
   * If they are able to transfer it out to a new wallet (because they have access to the seed phrase), can they actually even send it to a different wallet? Because they would recover it to a different wallet with the same seed phrase.

My understanding with Multisig is that it requires all means of verification (in a 2-2 setup) to be able to send/sign crypto out. However, I have no idea what happens if you have a Multisig setup, and someone gains access to your seed key on the cold wallet.",1,bitcoinbeginners,2022-01-19 19:35:45

Can someone please explain where the BTC goes when it's moved from an exchange to a wallet? That's what confuses me -- if the wallet doesn't actually hold BTC, where does the BTC go when it's moved from the exchange (e.g, Coinbase)?

Like if I take my BTC and then move it out of an exchange to a wallet, how/where do I see how much BTC I actually own? Like is there a universal ledger somewhere where I can type in my public key and it will tell me how much BTC I own?

I am imagining a situation like this: I move BTC from Coinbase/CashApp/Swan to a physical wallet like Ledger or Trezor. I have my 12-24 seed words saved somewhere. Five years from now, Ledger/Trezor go out of business and the physical wallet device no longer works, what happens? Can I input my 12-24 seed words elsewhere to get my private key?

With rising energy prices and increasing competition to mine will there come a point where the BTC reward isn't enough to tempt people to work on verifying transactions and keeping the network secure?

What's likely to happen then? Are on chain mining fees likely to reach extortionate levels or is the value of the BTC likely to mean that the reward will always be worth it?

What happens when all the coins are mined? A long way off I know and a lot will change but where will the incentives come from then?

This is something I'm still trying to wrap my head around, because, even though Bitcoin will become more scarce as the circulating supply reduces (hence it will be more difficult to own some, which should push the price upwards), it could also backfire: because less available coins means less money velocity, which means less usage, which means less utility of the asset as a currency, which could mean less demand. 

If that scenario would play out, then Bitcoin would never reach its full potential as global monetary system and unit of account, and it would remain as collectible / store of value?

Greetings Fellow Maxis,

I've fallen down the rabbit hole and have started my journey of contribution to the network by running a node (using Bitcoin and Lightning Network on Raspberry Pi by Harris Brakmic as my guide.) After finally compiling, downloading Bitcoin Client, and syncing with the blockchain, I've run into an issue.

When I attempt to create a wallet, the client will crash immediately. If I try opening the client again and choose ""open wallet,"" the client says there're no wallets available. After messing with configuration file a bit to no avail, I'm hoping a kind soul on this sub might know the cause of this issue. As I'm sure someone with any CS background can tell by this post, I'm not very savvy myself. (first time even typing into a terminal.)

Important to note: I can see the ""wallets"" folder created containing individual wallet name folders within my SSD storage. Within the individual wallet folders, a blank ""database"" folder is created along with a db.log file, which is also blank. It looks like the wallet creation might not be the problem, but possibly the data directory path?

Using Bitcoin Core version v.0.21.2rc2

Note: I am aware that not everyone can keep up with all of the articles and news, so please feel free to ask me the sources if you're curious. I shall reply you right away.

The only premise of bitcoin's existence is that ""other people should buy into it"": now this is the mother of all problems, firstly theres no inherent need of btc or blockchain for the vast majority of the population, which is why the valuation is very, very funky to say the least.

 Secondly, it is utterly inefficient at what it was initially meant to do (transact), now that more people are becoming aware or its limitations, they've changed their agenda to a more subtle ""store of value"" which I think is ludicrous considering how manipulated and speculative the crypto market is. There are little to no regulations and while people might say that's the whole point, government can and has in the past excercised its powers on crypto. So it is not something they cannot do. On top of that, crypto is highly related to the conventional markets, so I dont really know about the ""hedge against the economy debate"". 

It's very weird that people have to almost beg you to invest in crypto and shill it everywhere like a scheme. For me, if something was truly revolutionary it would be incorporated in the society already, rather than it always being a ""new"" technology. 

I am a math major, and I have studied the white paper of btc, maybe I am incapable but please, can anyone tell me how bitcoin or any other crypto for that matter is anywhere near useful? And how is it not just another pyramid/ponzi scheme. 

I am not against experimental tech, the technology behind the projects although inefficient, are not inherently a scam. But you know that I am talking about. For now the only major use for cryptos is for speculation so our conversation shall remain to the same.

One last thing, please understand logical fallacies, your ""Dollar is a scheme too"" argument doesnt work. Just because B is potentially bad doesnt make A automatically good. There are other fallacies that I will probably need to correct (if this post ever gets through in the first place).",0,bitcoinbeginners,2022-01-28 04:05:00

You are supposed to guard your seed phrase very carefully because anyone with the phrase can get your bitcoin. So that tells me that the hardware piece, the wallet, is basically disposable.

Ray Dalio believes that if/when BTC becomes very successful, then the government will simply have to regulate it as much as they can. And I assume they can do so by shutting down Coinbase and other exchanges, and banning BTC? ",29,bitcoinbeginners,2022-01-30 02:24:27

So the whole reason behind bitcoin was to have a currency available that can not be regulated by any government and therefore cannot be traced. An ideal payment-method for environment such as the black market where most of the transactions regard 'illegal stuff''. You could buy anything with 'X' bitcoins which translates in 'Y' dollars/euros/..

Now with bitcoin being on the stockmarket the value of bitcoin is SO UNSTABLE in time that when you sell/buy something with bitcoin you're not exactly exchanging bitcoin that's worth 'Y' in any valuta anymore but rather a STOCK of bitcoin that can be worth half or dubbel the next day, month, etc..

Has bitcoin lost it's purpose with stepping to the stockmarket? In other words: isn't a currency only useable when it's stable such as many other (regulated) valuta's as euro/dollar/..? And does this mean bitcoin only gets it's purpose/usage back at the point where it's stable on the stockmarket again? Because if so, that could take a very very long time right?

After messing with configuration file a bit to no avail, I'm hoping a kind soul on this sub might know the cause of this issue. As I'm sure someone with any CS background can tell by this post, I'm not very savvy myself. (first time even typing into a terminal.)

Important to note: I can see the ""wallets"" folder created containing individual wallet name folders within my SSD storage. Within the individual wallet folders, a blank ""database"" folder is created along with a db.log file, which is also blank.

I am speaking of people, communities, etc. that completely live under a bitcoin standard. 

The  closest thing I can imagine are the things I've read about the time in the nineteengh century, which was the closest thing to a true gold standard, where conversion rates from government money to gold were kept more or less stable during a certain period of time. Surprisingly (or not) most of the inventions come from that century, and not from the last one. 

I have also read (don't recall the source) that the real growth of the american economy in the twentieth century (measured either in gold or in real dollars without the effect of the monetary expansion) was really a low one-digit percentage growth. 

Since GDP in simple terms is all the money spent in an economy in a given period, it might very well be that a big chunk of it is money coming from loans, so that might not really reflect real growth. 

I'm trying to wrap my head around all these things: how would it look like taking fiat completely out of the ecuation?

My guesses are:

* People would stop purchasing things that are not really needed
* Things needed would be repaired instead of substituted every 2 years
* People would have long-term goals, and would plan long-term
* Prices across different regions would tend to homogeneize (it costs a similar amount of ""work"" to build a house in two different places)
* The amount of debt taken by individuals would be extremely reduced (time-value of money would be reduced so making use of leverage would be 
* Valuation of companies would also be drastically reduced (because of less leverage in the companies as well as because of less need for people to invest to maintain purchasing power

What is your take on this? Even though I would personally love to be able to live under a Bitcoin standard, I think that the way our society works would be put upside down, those would be quite some drastic changes",0,bitcoinbeginners,2022-01-31 19:34:26
shd576,throwaway78137210,24,https://redd.it/shd576,None,How can I get my crypto lost or stolen using this strategy?,"Hi r/BitcoinBeginners,

(Throwaway account for security reasons)

I'm a crypto noob that would like not to be robbed or lose their crypto. 

To physically store my seed phrase, I will follow this procedure:

* Securely encrypt seed phrase with a password
* Stamp three stainless steel sheets with the encrypted seed phrase
* Stamp one stainless steel sheet with the password
* Store in 4 independent locations

Some context on me as an attack surface:

* Live in the USA
* Live in a reasonably secure apartment building
* Storing $100k worth of crypto
* I'm not flashy or do anything to attract attention
* Nobody has any reason to attack me that I know of

If an attack is detected or suspected, my default counter-attack will be transferring tokens to a trusted third party.

Attack vectors and threat analysis I could think of:

|Attack vector|Threat analysis|
|:-|:-|
|Non-government actor threatens me|If the encryption password is stored sufficiently far away from the seed phrases, it will be physically risky for an attacker to attempt recovering it without police intervention.|
|Physical theft of a seed phrase by non-government actor|The attacker must now locate the seed phrase password before counter-attack, or physically threaten me|
|Physical theft of seed phrase encryption password by non-government actor|The attacker must now find the seed phrase before counter-attack, or physically threaten me|
|Government actor attempts to seize password and seed phrase illegally|Before counter-attack, the government actor must discover the encryption scheme and locate both seed phrase and password.|
|Government actor attempts to compel password from me illegally|In the US, I understand that the government can't jail me for not disclosing a password. I'm not a lawyer.|
|I die|I'm don't know how to solve this one. Open to suggestions.|

**Where should I put my three copies of the seed phrase and one copy of the password?** **Where should I not? How can I still lose my crypto? Are there any non-obvious flaws with this custody scheme?**

Bonus points if you explain any non-obvious caveats or attack vectors, especially for something that ""seems secure,"" like a US bank lockbox. I know this is probably ""too secure,"" but I intend to be forward-looking to a time when wealth grows, also growing my risk.

shnxy3,roadstercraft,35,https://redd.it/shnxy3,None,Question: Parsing my seed phrase?,"Can I parse my 12-word or 24-word seed phrase using an Excel formula?

Let's say my first word of seed phrase is ""sunny"". Now if we assign A=1, B=2, then S=19, U = 21 etc.

In Microsoft Excel, you can use:

    =CODE(UPPER(A1))-64

Now I will add or subtract or multiply a random digit for S-value i.e. 19. So let me add 3, which gives me 22 (which I can call a 'derived number').

For ""U"", let me multiply 21 with 5, which gives me 105, and so on for each letter of the entire seed phrase.

Now, I will store these 'derived numbers' in one place. And the formula (and the reverse of that formula) in another place. Whenever I need to re-generate the original seed phrase I will just run the formula in a reverse way (i.e. subtract instead of add, divide instead of multiply etc.).

Is this a better way rather than writing seed phrase as plain text in a paper and even getting those steel/titanium engravings?

Any suggestions?

I  guess I am just a little confused on how are people using it? Even with  LN I need to make two transactions at least ($4) just to open then  close the channel. If I had to pay $2 every time I used my credit card  I'd only spend cash, which is what Bitcoin is supposed to be.

Finally,  A LOT of people seem to say BTC is not peer to peer digial cash but is  actaully a store of value, well, my BTC has lost like 40% of its value  since I bought it, so that also makes no sense, at best it is a highly  volitle speculative asset with no real world use.

I've been using Muun to hold a small balance of lightning. I really like that it integrates lightning and on-chain. The UI is perfect. It's a native iOS app. But it seems to use a non-standard recovery key instead of a seedphrase? I don't really understand if that's something I should be worried about.  
  
I was using Blue Wallet at first. It's nice but it always felt a little slow. Looking at the source code, it appears to be written in react native which explains why. From a security standpoint it relies on a react native library, which I don't know enough to know if this is a security issue or not.  
  
I recently created a wallet on Green wallet, which has a nice UI like Muun and is a native iOS app. No lightning though but that's ok.

Is there any boundary after its crossing you start to put your money in a private wallet?
let’s say 1000 usd, is it risky enough to keep it eg on Binance?
or let’s say 10k usd is still relatively safe (with u2f keys) to keep on Binance?

I think I would make sure my account is safe although I’m more scared if a hack that an exchange is not able to handle, or exchange falls but Binance is pretty huge

So if I buy a ledger is the process to move the Bitcoin off the network safe and easy and also at what level should I resonably do this? For example if I have 200 sats it’s not worth taking it off, should you start to consider removal around 0.1 or a coin or so?

. 

The root seed is generated from not only the mnemonic X-word list, but also the passphrase - yes optional but. 

Which comes first, the Seed Recovery Phrase or the Seed? It is **the full mnemonic, with the passphrase included** that produces the seed, and that is one-way, right? 

Also, I believe the generation of the master private key is an intermediate **but separate** step 

before deriving the extended version by incorporating the chain code, right?

sre8eq,Bigferra88,39,https://redd.it/sre8eq,None,My concerns about Bitcoin after informing myself,"Hi guys,

I decided to open this post in order to get some answers about few questions that still, after long weeks of reading, studying videos etc. do not fully convince me to look at BITCOIN as a long term asset and possible real alternative to FIAT currenncies.

My background is that I am a student of economics and a millenial, just in order to give you perspective.

1) deflation value of BITCOIN: My first concern is that, as of course BIG inflation is a concern, a small inflation (3-5%) is generally considered GOOD for consumption economy and for economy in general, because knowing your money will most probably be valued LESS in the future you tend to be willing to BUY NOW, or INVEST protecting it from the inflative phenomenon.

BITCOIN in particular (I think no-limit cryptocurrencies circumnavigate this problem) is by definition a deflative currency, because it has a limited supply that will bring in any case its price UP in the future; knowing that what is in my pocket TODAY will have a higher value in the future, WHY should I use it to buy things? I will always be motivated to keep it in my pocket and see its value rise.

2) Traceability problem and criminality use: still to today from what I see the best use of an anonymous de-centralized currency system like bitcoin (yes, you have your public key, but technically no one can know your private key and go really back to your real identity) is to use it in order to transfer money linked to illegal activity easily from one part to the other of the world or to use it for money laundry practice (I see no better and easier way to stock some illegally obtained cash).

This is actually a concern I have on ALL cryptocurrency schemes in general

3) Energy intensive problem: It is already demonstrated that in general BITCOIN due to the proof of work coding system has a crazy high environmental cost. 

To quote the most discussed study on the matter and quantify the problem:

""The report states that each Bitcoin transaction consumes 1,173 kilowatt hours of electricity. That's the volume of energy that could ""power the typical American home for six weeks,"" the authors add. The Bitcoin mining that enables a purchase, sale or transfer, it posits, uses a slug of electricity that costs $176.""

I attach also a useful screenshot that makes me think.

Let me know what you think of these 3 long term concerns for me that make me see a HUGE opportunity in crypto and even more in blockchain, but make me very skeptic about BITCOIN be really a long term asset and potential substitute of traditional currencies.",4,bitcoinbeginners,2022-02-13 08:44:17

su3dvz,HrvrdMonky,8,https://redd.it/su3dvz,None,How do I keep my crypto activity under the table? Asking academically for a friend.,"Things we can count on in life are death and taxes. It’s not advisable to attempt to elude either one but given we endeavour to be masters of our destiny…

Since my friend already has a source for unicorn blood (legit imported from the promise land), I figured we could start a discussion about the ‘Unicorn Blood’ for the 2nd point. 

This discussion is for academic and karma purposes only ;-)
Everyone should report their income and follow their laws/regulations so you can help pay for my healthcare.
If your activity attracts attention by the authorities, they’ll still track you dispute these steps below… just say no to illegal activity.

Why: My friend and I haven’t heard of centralized and regulated exchanges/crypto dealers reporting customer activity to the tax man but I can imagine it would be an easy fight to force these organizations to share this kind of activity in the future.

Not all the steps should be thought of as required but the space is evolving so this is more for good measure.

1. Start an email that is not specific to your personal information from a privacy oriented provider (proton mail for example). Only use this email for the one exchange account - nothing else. Use strong password formatting/keeping.

2. Use a vpn showing you from a less regulation-oriented country (ex. GT), open an exchange account with a provider that allows for decent daily withdrawal limits for unverified accounts (ex. Kucoin allows <1BTC/day). Always show your activity from that country.

3. Don’t use your phone number (SMS) for verification purposes.

4. Fund your exchange account through sources that don’t know or KYC you. Example, peer to peer, Bisq, Coinshack (<$600/day as of today). All of these sources won’t perform KYC and will allow you to stage value into and out of the cryptosphere. 

5. NEVER commingle your new under-the-table activity with KYC end points.

At least that’s how I would do it, if I was ever gonna do it, not that I have. To the naughty noobs that insist on being dumb and drinking unicorn blood, you’re welcome.",2,bitcoinbeginners,2022-02-16 18:57:10

3. I have an Umbrel Node. But I've sent KYC bitcoin to it's electrum BTC wallet in the past. Has this compromised my node's privacy? (I used this BTC to fund my node's lightning channels)

But from my research I have come to the understanding that so long as no one but myself has access to my private keys/seed phrase, then there is virtually no way my crypto can be ""hacked"". 

&#x200B;

So even if I were to use my Nano S to transfer crypto on an infected computer, or if someone store my phone and had access to my Ledger Live account, or used malware to spy on my computer/phone, there is still no way from them to steal my funds without them knowing my private keys/seed phrase. Is this correct?  


And as an aside, if the only thing that matters in terms of security is keeping my private keys safe, is a Nano S therefore just as secure as any other cold storage wallet? I am a bit concerned about storing large amounts of crypto on a $60 device, intuitively I would think that a much more expensive, complicated device is necessary. But it seems to me that a Nano S is just as secure as any cold storage wallet so long as I am the only one with access to my private keys.

I've tried reading stuff, watching videos, and honestly I haven't found much that explains things well. Tell me if this is correct, I'll number the different points:

1) Bitcoin is both an app and a currency. The currency aspect is straightforward: as long as both parties accept the use of Bitcoin, it's just a normal payment. Where the app comes in, is that 

2) Bitcoin transactions need to be verified (because there's no ""central authority"" behind Bitcoin), and 

3) transactions get verified by the network of other users of the Bitcoin app. 

4) They lend the computing power of their computers to ""solve complex math problems"" (apparently).

5) people who do this (lending computing power to verify transactions) are called miners

6) miners get paid in Bitcoin 

Now I have a few questions.

7) who exactly pays the miners?

8) when does a miner get paid? I'm assuming the first person whose computer completes the verification of a transaction is the one who gets paid, and it's not a shared effort kind of thing.

I don't see why aren't companies mining Bitcoin and using the residual heat to heat up the facilities they have, or getting hot water, or whatever. With a heat exchanger there are plenty of things you could do. 

I guess awareness is not yet there, and probably the reputation of bitcoin miners among ""serious"" companies is not the best. 

I guess I am being naive here and the numbers don't necessarily add up, but from a theoretical perspective:

* if they mine bitcoin they of course get exposure to the price appreciation of the asset
* If they use the residual heat to heat up their facilities, they save on energy costs (today, major cost driver)
* If they use renewable sources of energy to power up the mining machines, they could have a zero net impact on the environment

I have recently just got into trading crypto (day trading) and I have some questions about the concept because it just sounds too good to be true and I need some clarifications here.

So as long as you buy low and sell high, you are always on a profit. I don't intend to use leverage. I prioritize the risk management over more gain.

So, as far as I understand and I will use Bitcoin as an example:

I invest 1000$ when the bitcoin is 36500 and I sell it when it is 38000 I will have a profit of around 40$ on this trade.

Let's say I screw it up and I buy it at 36500 and the market drops and drops and I don't want to sell it in the same day. Instead of just having an auto stop when my profit is -200$ for example cause  I am afraid I will lose even more. Can't I just wait with that trade for a few days or weeks until it will go back up to at least be a bit on a profit?

I just don't see how you can lose money if you only sell when it's higher than what you bought it for. Maybe you cannot sell it in the same day but you can sell it in the future when it will go up again.

The only way to lose money as far as I understand it's by buying when the cost it's really high and it'll never go above that or you just give up on the trade cause you are afraid it will never go up again.

How is my understanding so far?

I've been watching videos and reading articles but am still confused when it comes to the bitcoin hard wallets and was hoping someone could help out.

Right now I have $10K in my bank account ready to purchase how ever many bitcoin that comes out to be at the time based on cost.  I've opened a Coinbase account to move the $10K to from my bank to facilitate the purchase.  I know that after the purchase I know own $10K worth of bitcoin.  

What I don't get is how the hard wallet comes into play.  I'm planning on getting the Ledger Nano X as soon as I figure this out.  

So after I make the purchase how would I move the bitcoin to the Nano?  Or am I missing something at this point?

Also, I've heard about debit cards through Coinbase and such that you can use to pay in bitcoin rather that cash.  With the wild fluxuations in BTC price, and the story of the $7M pizza that I've heard about, is it wize to pay in bitcoin yet, or wait until it becomes more stable?  I see videos a lot of people in Asian countries paying in bitcoin for a lot of things, but again I must be missing something to understand how a thing then is not $5 on minute and $25 the next, if you know what I mean.

t28g6z,ekatane,20,https://redd.it/t28g6z,None,How is bitcoin the answer to oppression if transfers are under state control?,"Hello, first post here. Maybe a dumb question, but...

During the Canada trucker protests, when we saw donations to the cause being frozen by the state, it seemed like Bitcoin's moment to shine, and every other post on social media claimed that 'Bitcoin fixes this!'

But, to my eyes, it seemed like the solution fell short. While a person could donate to a Bitcoin wallet that was purportedly tied to the protests, that donation didn't do them any good if they had no way to convert that Bitcoin to dollars. Obviously, the recipient couldn't directly use Bitcoin to buy groceries or gas, they'd need to sell that Bitcoin to get money into their bank account, and that transfer to the bank account could be prevented or frozen. Same goes for trying to use a service like PayPal to broker the transaction between a Bitcoin wallet and a store - PayPal can (and will) cave to state pressure in these situations.

I understand that P2P transfers are basically beyond state control, which sounds good in principle, but eventually \*someone\* has to transfer that Bitcoin to cash and interact with the regular economy, and it seems to me like that attempted transfer will always be under the control of the state. Is there something I'm missing here?

Some of those exchange wallets have held Bitcoin for over 1 year, while others hold Bitcoin   that was purchased less than 365 days ago.

If I consolidate these different sources of BTC into one cold storage wallet, how would I be taxed if I made a withdraw from that cold-storage wallet in the near future?

This would assume that I withdraw BTC from cold storage before all the BTC in that cold storage wallet officially enters long-term capital gains  territory.

As a hypothetical example, let's say one exchange contains 0.75 BTC that is over 1 year old, and my other exchange contains 0.25 BTC that is  only  30 days old. Then I send both of those sources of BTC to the same cold storage wallet. Let's say that in 2 weeks I decide to withdraw  0.10 BTC. Is the  withdraw of 0.10 BTC going to be taxed according to  long-term or short-term capital gains?

Do these BTC exchange platforms keep records they can send to you so you can find out? I've found Blockchain's support to be absolutely horrible. I filed a ticket with their support and didn't get a reply for 4 months and they acted like there was no problem with that. I read the 4 year old post:

Or is only if you are holding it as an asset and cash out that it becomes an issue? I've also lost money on it from being ripped off by scammers, but I'm guessing the IRS wouldn't care about that, they just care about the transferring of it?

If someone finds a fast enough algorithm that can invert that function, they can abuse the system, is that correct? There is no mathematical proof that an algorithm like that (that can invert that function quickly enough) doesn't exist (or for any other one-way hash function). If there was a mathematical proof that algorithm like that doesn't exist, then it would prove that P != NP and that problem is unsolved which implies that there is no mathematical proof like that. If anyone manages to find an algorithm that inverts SHA-256, then they don't have to tell anyone that they managed to do it, instead they can abuse the system, right?

And if there is no mathematical proof that it's impossible to find an algorithm that inverts that function, then it's totally possible that someone will eventually find that algorithm.

However, you can't send from the wallet, but from the computer.

Because of this, I need to find an exchange site, but I want to make sure it's reasonably secure/isn't a scam/hasn't had a million hacks, can transfer to paypal without long waiting times before you're allowed (I think coinbase falls foul of both of these due to hacks and waiting to be allowed to send to paypal), and doesn't require a load of real world info to be put in\*, or make you go through hoops to get an account, or charge to keep it open.

So the path I want is

Bitcoin Core (my offline wallet) > Intermediary exchange/whatever method allows it (either converting to currency or sending as bitcoin) > Paypal account > then perhaps bank at my discretion.

I'm not strictly a bitcoin beginner, but there used to be a site years ago that didn't require real world info, allowed trades (where it would be held in that third party until both sides went through), and then once you had your national currency it would be sent to your linked paypal address.

Please let me know your comments and what you think about this. This is what I read in an article recently. I quote, 

*""With a few tweaks of code, blockchain can be corrupted by authoritarians to build social credit enslavement systems.

taav00,PureHumanKill,13,https://redd.it/taav00,None,Goedkoopste manier Crypto aanschaffen? [NL],"*For the Dutchies*

&#x200B;

Beste Beginners,

&#x200B;

Sinds kort ben ik in de crypto-wereld gestapt en heb nu wat ervaring met verschillende exchanges, ik zie hier veel mensen die niet weten wat de beste plek is om crypto aan te schaffen, graag deel ik mijn mening aangezien ik de afgelopen tijd tientallen exchanges heb geprobeerd.

&#x200B;

Er zijn een paar exchanges die ik als beginner direct kan wegstrepen voor je, dit omdat de exchanges in Europa of Nederland niet meer aan de wettelijke voorschriften doen en het dus niet gebruikersvriendelijk is voor ons, ook zijn de transactie kosten op sommige platformen buitengewoon schandalig.

**- Binance** ( niet gebruikersvriendelijk voor mensen in EU. )

**- Coinbase** ( Hoge transactie kosten, veel storingen op het platfrom & slechte klantenservice. )

Nu zijn dit wel 2 hele bekende exchanges, natuurlijk kan je deze platformen gebruiken maar uit persoonlijke ervaring zijn dit simpelweg niet de gemakkelijkste platformen, maar welke wel?

&#x200B;

De volgende stap is transactie kosten vergelijken, we moeten dit op een paar verschillende manier doen.

1. Transactie kosten als je al crypto munten bezit. 
2. Transactie kosten als je euro's nog op je bank staan.
3. Transactie kosten tussen platformen.

&#x200B;

1. ( Kosten vergeleken met 10 USDC naar BTC. )

Top 3 goedkoopste platformen:

**- Kucoin.** ( Kosten:  €0,02 )

**- Swissborg.** ( Kosten:  €0,03 )

**- Celcius.** ( Kosten:  €0,04 )

&#x200B;

2. ( Kosten vergeleken met  €1000,- van bank naar platform naar BTC. )

**- Bitvavo** ( Kosten:  €6,15 )

**- FTX** ( Kosten:  €9,76 )

**- Swissborg** ( Kosten:  €12,69 )

&#x200B;

3. ( Kosten vergeleken met  €1000,- versturen van platform naar platform. )

**- Bitvavo** ( Kosten:  €6,87 )

**- FTX** ( Kosten:  €9,76 )

**- Swissborg** ( Kosten:  €30,71 )

&#x200B;

Ik heb deels de cijfers gepakt van een onderzoek van [deze](https://www.meercrypto.nl/goedkoopste-crypto-platform) website, hun gaan ook nog wat dieper in op de inhoud & vergelijken meer platformen.

Toch zien we dat Bitvavo een van de goedkoopste exchanges is, persoonlijk vindt ik de interface van Bitvavo ook een goede voor beginners, ook heeft Bitvavo een Nederlandse klantenservice wat handig kan zijn, ook kan je betalen met iDeal wat ideaal is!

&#x200B;

Natuurlijk is het ook goed om zelf onderzoek te doen, maar ik wou mijn persoonlijke mening graag laten horen voor de **beginners!**",1,bitcoinbeginners,2022-03-09 15:57:24

taokgt,ekatane,6,https://redd.it/taokgt,None,A scenario.,"OK, here's the scenario.

It's 2026 (or some other near future date, just pick one and don't get too hung up on date). There is an important political movement you want to be an active part of, but the ruling administration doesn't like it. So, they've deployed their now tried-and-tested method of knee capping such movements: they begin freezing the accounts of those identified as supporting the movement. So, you find one morning that your fiat accounts have all been frozen. You have no access to traditional banking services.

But, you were prepared for this! You have tucked away several months expenses worth of BTC on a reliable cold storage wallet. No state agency knows your addresses, so there is nothing for them to attempt to 'freeze' or 'lock out'. Great!

So....now what?

Best case scenario: you can find local retailers that accept BTC payments, and the state has been too slow or too incompetent to prevent you from using your BTC to pay for things. If so, great. But more likely, in such a scenario, the state has ordered retailers to stop accepting BTC payments from everyone, or has gotten their hooks into the payment providers and forced them all to KYC, in which case you're not going to be able to pay for goods/services with BTC directly.

You could look for individuals willing to sell you goods/services in exchange for P2P BTC, but that's going to be very hard to find. Ditto for people willing to do F2F BTC purchases in cash.

So, now what? How do you use your carefully tucked away BTC on your cold storage wallet to weather the storm? Is there a way, or are you just screwed?",5,bitcoinbeginners,2022-03-10 02:45:11

taz5j6,ekatane,124,https://redd.it/taz5j6,None,Bitcoin seems worse than cash in a crisis,"I've been posting questions here for a couple of weeks trying to understand how one of Bitcoin's central benefits (the idea that it can't be controlled by the state because its decentralized) would really be valuable in real world contexts. Specifically, if you were worried about your bank account being frozen (like during the Trucker Protests in Canada), Bitcoin is supposed to be your salvation in such a situation.

But after asking these questions and reading the responses, it really seems to me like just having a safe in your house with a bunch of cash in it would be far more useful in such a situation than having an equivalent amount of Bitcoin. There just aren't that many situations where you can rely on P2P transactions, and the state can easily police the boundary between Bitcoin and fiat (exchanges, POS devices, eCommerce, etc).

Do I have this wrong? What am I missing?

&#x200B;

EDIT: Lots of good dialogue here. FWIW, I wanted to flag that most answers seem to be focusing on the 'inflation proof store of value' benefit of Bitcoin here, and not enough on the 'unfreezeable decentralized currency' benefit of Bitcoin. I understand that if you are a Russian citizen and you sunk your life's savings into Bitcoin in January, the value of that life savings would be in tact today.

If you needed to secure or memorize their seed phrase, imagine how much more difficult things would be if your seed phrase was for example 24 random Hindi words, in an alphabet that you didn't even recognize.

I was wondering if anyone has seen a good solution to this. I know there are the Spanish and French versions of the BIP49 word list but I am pretty sure no wallet uses them, and always default to English seed words. 

The only solution I can think of is a word for word translation of the original English list to be made available, but I haven't seen any online nor does it   doesn't sound very practical.",25,bitcoinbeginners,2022-03-11 02:09:09

I send approx. 0.15 BTC from Binance to my Ledger two weeks ago. I can see the amount on my Ledger but it still says that the transaction is not confirmed yet. When i view the transaction on the explorer it says 2424 confirmations.

I thought that i maybe need to connect and and login with my Ledger to update the status which i did but it still says the same thing.

So my quesiton now really is if it takes this long for the transaction to be confirmed or if i fucked up somehow? I send the BTC to my Native Segwit account to my Ledger.

Thanks for your answers.

&#x200B;

EDIT: Thank you all for your suggestions. The problem was solved by doing the following which was suggested by u/TPK001

*""Sounds like you are all set - except for Ledger Live not showing confirmed.*

*Try this - In Ledger Live, can you click on the ""Gear"" symbol / Settings.*

*Under the Tab - Help, second Item is Clear Cache - that forces a re-synchronization with the blockchain. Hopefully that helps.*

*You dont need the hardware device connected for this.""*

I am interested in learning more about running my own node and would like to hear from others who are currently doing just this.

I would be greatful to anyone who can answer these few questions fro me:

1. How easy is it for a none techy to set up and run a node? ie is there any coding knowledge required
2. What are the system/hardware requirements?
3. Is running your own node and using it as a wallet safer than using a multisig cold wallet setup?
4. What is the main benefit of running your own node?

td7ld8,linuxusr,6,https://redd.it/td7ld8,None,Thinking About Running a Full Node on Windows OS?,"**The purpose of this post is FYI, helpful hints and “gotchas.”**

**Although I have been running a Full Node for a couple of months now, it was only yesterday that I optimized\*\* my node by successfully achieving port forwarding (8333).**

**That is not straightforward. Let’s add a VPN to the mix, even though I’m not running one, and consider that in an optimized Full Node there are three links in the chain that you have to consider: the OS, the modem, the VPN. This is a “gotcha” because if you fail to consider one of these components, you may not be able to optimize. Further, each of these links, if you think of it as a coin, has two sides: One side is that 8333 is explicitly made open. The other side is that even if 8333 is explicitly made open, another software feature could be blocking it, in which case, you cannot optimize. So, actually, there are six variables to consider: the OS, open versus block; the modem; open versus block; the VPN open versus block.**

**Further on in this post I will describe my initial failures, confusions, and how I fixed the problems.**

**I am running Windows 11 Pro and my modem is ARRIS TG2482. I also run Linux but I choose Windows for some projects and Linux for others (e.g. BOINC).**

**I am proud to say that as a nearly 69 year old retiree in the Dominican Republic, that I am running the only Full Node in this country. I can confirm this at the website: bitnode.io   When you are up and running go to this URL to confirm your status. It has a “CHECK NODE” tool that will tell you if you are receiving connections from other nodes. Hint: If you have configured your modem with a range 1024 and 65535, you will not see that range here. You will simply see “8333” next to your ip address. The tool already “sees” your status, so just click on the “CHECK NODE.” If you get a green bar, you can receive data from other nodes; if you get a red bar, you cannot.  For my output I get:  148.103.81.99:8333 /Satoshi:22.0.0/**

**This site also shows the number of running nodes (\~ 15260) as well as a world map, a list of all countries running nodes, and the number of nodes per country.**

**And much more.**

**CUTTING TO THE CHASE**

**You are thinking about running a BTC Full Node on Windows. (Remember that the source code for the BTC blockchain is open source so that altcoin will each run its own nodes, procedures may be different, etc.)**

**The first step is to eyeball your modem for the make and model and download the manual or quick start if you don’t have it. The manual will tell you your modem’s ip address and the default user name and password. “Enter” your modem” by typing its ip address into a browser. (If you are not online and/or your computer does not have a wi-fi, just connect an ethernet cable to the modem and you will have access. Any configuration changes you make and save in the modem from your computer will occur regardless of your online status).**

**Look for a tab or a menu item that says “firewall” or “advanced configuration” or “port forwarding” or “port triggering.” It is mandatory that your modem have the capacity for port forwarding or port triggering. If it doesn’t you cannot optimize your node and must buy a new modem and have your ISP provision it. Many ISP’s will list compatible modems on their website. You can then download the manuals of various ones to see which have advanced configuration.**

**Doing it. Problems, Confusions, and Solutions.**

**To set up, I turned off my modem’s firewall. YMMV. My modem had two different menus: one for port forwarding and one for port triggering. Since you can use either one, choose the simplest one. For me, that was port forwarding. The first thing I could see was that it was not possible to open port 8333 because there was no field in which to put a single port, that there were only fields to express a range, so I put in 1024 and 65535. For the ARRIS modem there were clickable “helps” which told me that for both incoming and outgoing ranges, that they would be the same, so I put in these values for both incoming and outgoing. That doesn’t make sense to me but that’s how it was. Besides inputting a name, the only other field was for my ip address. For that I opened Windows Search < Command Prompt and typed in  ipconfig. Then I saved all and logged out of my modem.**

**Then, to be on the safe side, I rebooted both my computer and the modem. After that, I went to Bitcoin Core Information tab and saw “0 in; 10 out.” Problem! I’m not optimized even though I configured my modem. Did I make a mistake in the config.?**

**Then from the same tab I opened my Debug log file. Remember to scroll DOWN for the present time. If you read data from the top, you are looking at the past time.**

**Here I discovered “New outbound peer connected.” This is good. My modem is configured correctly! But confusing too. If my info tab shows “0” in, I’d expect to see “New inbound peer connected.” What is going on? I think that “outbound peer connected” means that I am now connected to other nodes. THEIR DATA IS OUTGOING FOR THEM BUT INCOMING TO ME. So the log should NOT say “inbound peer connected.”**

**But I still have a problem. The Bitcoin Core is a program designed for Windows OS. It is embedded in Windows, the registry, etc. So although Windows is showing via my log that I’m connected to outbound peers, I’m not receiving data from outbound peers.**

**And here’s a reminder of the “Gotcha!” that you have to consider the three links in the chain: the OS, the modem, the VPN; and not only port forwarding but port blocking.**

**So now I have a hunch that Windows is blocking my incoming data (showing “0” on the info tab).**

**I go to Settings < Privacy & Security < Firewall & Network Protection. Lo and behold! I have THREE firewalls turned on. I disable: Domain network firewall; Private network firewall; Public network firewall. Disable and apply and ignore Windows’ warnings. Whether you need to disable all three: YMMV.**

**Then I reboot, after shutting down CORE, then re-start Core (I turn off autostart and prefer manual stat), go to Info tab and see In: 14/ Out: 10! I go to Network Traffic and for the first time I get two real time graphs, green received and red sent. And at bitnodes.io I am recognized and get a green bar. Success! I have optimized! Needless to say, I still had “failure” after a proper modem config. because of an OS block.**

**\*\*Full Node optimization. Turns out that before I optimized I was still running a Full Node but a lesser Full Node. A Full Node is made up of different components. If you run 1 but not > than 1 you are still running a Full Node but less that optimized. Analogy: Given an identified music composition that you are listening to on your computer, the name of the composition is the same, but you can alter it qualitatively by adding or subtracting data, say by using the DAC soldered onto your motherboard versus buying an independent external DAC and bypassing the inferior one. The name of the composition is the same (Full Node) but the qualitative degrees are different—same in kind, different in degree, if you will.**

**You can see the various components of BTC Full Node when you look at your peers’ data per individual. These are the permutations possible:**

**Inbound  (This is me before)**

**Outbound Full Relay (This is me after)**

**Network**

**Bloom**

**Witness**

**Network Limited**

**One peer may run 1 or more of the above. I guess it’s obvious why I am NOT listed as a peer here. To see my “component” status as a peer, I go to bitnode.io and I find out that my services are: node witness and node network limited (1032).** ***Service*** **is the correct word, so I will substitute that for “component.”**

**I’m sure that further service tweaks are possible and I will investigate those as time goes on.**",3,bitcoinbeginners,2022-03-13 14:04:13

1. I want an unlimited number of distinct crypto accounts. This is just for reserving amounts of money for different purposes. I’ll need a convenient way to view and manage them all.

2. I want to have actions available like “freeze this account for one week” - do not allow me to take money out at all - or to freeze accounts permanently unless I command a transfer which occurs by default on a time delay - like, you can pull out money from this account but it always arrives one week later.

The point is for really absolute self-control in terms of spending.

I am trying to pull this off with some kind of password restriction mechanism. Assuming your gateway to your crypto is the wallet password, perhaps I could write some command line scripts which perform some action by automatically entering the password, but the data is encrypted/scrambled in the file and on some deep system command to not be unencrypted except on a certain time?

Or anything like that. I feel like I can think of many possible strategies but I don’t know what might be most effective yet elegant and simple. The point, again, is to design a system that has a genuine time delay in it - it cannot be overridden, either at all or just not easily, at least.

If they have a pool, they can assume that not every customer moves their BTC simultaneously, and they can play with the numbers. For example, they reserve a pool of 50% of the BTCs to stay working.

When they need 60%, they can buy 10% extra in an emergency.

Customers on an exchange can believe they have together 100 BTC, whereas there is only 50 BTC or less in reality.

Or vice versa, a pool of 50 BTC is used to make 100 users believe that everyone has 1 BTC.",62,bitcoinbeginners,2022-03-18 12:04:11

If someone were to purchase $100k worth of bitcoin this year and wanted to store that Bitcoin (hodl) until 2050, what is the best and most secure wallet to do this and the most secure way to backup your recovery phrase, taking into account most wallet providers could either go bust by then or have moved on to different projects/things (e.g. Trezor, Ledger). So there should be a way to easily restore the wallet using the equivalent of Electrum at the time (unless Electrum is still around in 2050).

I'm looking into this question to see what wallet would provide the most security during a near 30 year period, and won't be touching if Bitcoin drops to $1,000, or increases to $10,000,000. Just storing.

From the research I have done into this so far, having the 24 key word recovery phrase seems to be the number one most important aspect of this.

From then until today I have filled my wallet with small UTXOs of mine from different sources (various kyc and non-kyc sources), but I also store btc from some family members. 

I like small UTXOs. They bring me privacy (ifd I pay from one address they will know what I have at that address, but not the rest), they allow me to say to authorities that some UTXOs (especially those obtained with KYC) were used for spending and not for holding, etc. 

But I don't trust my passphrase, I would like to change it. 

Considering that at this time my wallet has multiple accounts with multiple UTXOS, can you come up with any ideas on how to make the ""move""?

a) Create my new passphrase and go UTXO by UTXO (I'm worried about the money I can spend in commissions doing it this way)

b) Consolidate UTXOS two by two or three by three (saving on commissions, loss of privacy

c) Consolidate UTXOS massively (absolute loss of privacy and the possibility of denying the possession of coins with KYC. Maximum savings in commissions)

I would like to know what you think of these options, in case there is something to take into account that I have not yet considered, as well as if there is any option ""d"" that I have not yet thought of.

Ideally the Wallet-Client software runs on a smartphone platform rather than having to use a PC, Android preferred

So far among software wallet-clients, have only found Metamask and Bluewallet 

Hardware wallets seem to implement this with a full wipe & reset only, or just different passphrases, not what I'm talking about (see below) 

The only exception so far seems to be the project Seedsigner

DIY air-gapped amnesiac hardware wallet, FOSS & ""open hardware""

https://seedsigner.com/hardware/

https://github.com/SeedSigner/seedsigner

https://bitcoinmagazine.com/guides/how-to-use-the-seedsigner-bitcoin-wallet

Every session you need private keys for signing, you import your Seed Recovery Phrase (mnemonic + passphrase) into the device, secrets storage lasts only for that session, all are wiped once the device powers down or reboots.

Yes, that means you need to securely store your SRP closer to hand than the usual buried cryptosteel, but a QR image can be a bit more discreet than cleartext

Feedback on this device please, ideally from experience if you aren't a BTC expert

One potential flaw I see is, addresses are generated on the hot pubkey-only wallet, rather than getting verified on the HWW? 


... 

My jargon definitions: ""account-wallets"" means a different BIP39 mnemonic, not just a different passphrase, nor just a different BIP32 root seed / xprv, and certainly not talking about just switching to a different derivation path

wallet-clients can be software or hardware

""accommodate"" can include logging out and back in, or swapping out config-files

Using Kraken, I bought some BTCs and transferred them to an Exodus Wallet. I have a 12 word ""password"" that was generated by Exodus. This is the password that ""rebuilds"" my wallet (in case I forget, or lose the simpler password that I generate myself). I think I understand this pretty good, maybe.

Ultimately, I want to put my BTC into cold storage, but I need to understand a few things. I cannot find specific answers to these questions and getting burned out watching the mostly terrible, how to videos on YT.

These questions are all interrelated, so, probably there is a way to answer the questions in a single, simple explanation that answers them all.

Questions: 

Is it possible to transfer my BTC to a new wallet using that 12 word password from Exodus? Like download a new wallet, put in the 12 words, and boom, there is my BTC in the new wallet.

When people say they are putting their BTC into ""Cold Storage"", is that the 12 word password? Or is there something else it stores?

I read people saying they memorize their 12 word (or more) password so they always have their BTC safe. So, if I memorize my 12 word password, am I able to open it into any new wallet I get? 

Can I cold storage my BTC in my head)? So, I have a software wallet that people can pay me in BTC, while All my BTC is stored in my head?

Ultimately, I would like to memorize my 12 word password and use my brain as the cold storage. Am I understanding the way this works, or am I way off?

Unlike fiat where more money can be printed to make up for lost supply, the number of accessible Bitcoins is always going to trend down due to hacked wallets and lost passwords. And unlike gold which is a physical asset that can *generally* be found/mined again, losing Bitcoin from the crypto economy is an irreversible process. 

It seems to me like the people that have the most to gain are people already invested in Bitcoin currently. And in terms of using it as an actual currency, the longer time goes on, the smaller the increments that will be transacted between regular people, as its value skyrockets. Decades down the road, the distribution of the currency will largely be determined by the how generous the current owners are. It's not too unlike how we're currently held to the whims of governments' spending decisions when it comes to distributing fiat, except it's even less democratic because private owners have no obligation to anyone but themselves. Governments at least have to keep up somewhat of an appearance of caring. 

I guess my question is, how is this better than the current monetary system, and how can it act as a universal currency when its supply cannot be replenished? Besides hype, what factors are actually propping the value of Bitcoin?

The only time I can see Bitcoin being useful is in times of political turmoil. If your country's fiat is not accepted, then it can serve as a backup. But I'd rather not invest in something that relies on the countries falling into disarray to prop up its value. 

Sorry if this post seems critical, I just feel like I must be missing something big here if I'm seeing all these flaws yet so many people are into Bitcoin. I'm just seeking to understand.",52,bitcoinbeginners,2022-03-27 22:26:53

most of books about crypto  is written by people trading in it and is in their interest to make it look like an investment so price keep going up or at least keep price active in the market.

A while back I had an idea to create a rather simple video game that teaches cryptocurrency concepts and definitions. I began development on said game and made decent progress but lost interest and put it on hold. Through this time I kept the idea relatively close to my chest and didn't share much about it for fear of someone taking the idea. 

It wasn't until I read a blog post from a rather prolific board game designer, Jamey Stegmaier, that my thinking on ideas really changed. 

He said regarding ideas:

**Share it:** Share your idea today with at least 5 people, ideally on a public forum. You might be afraid of someone stealing your idea. Don’t be. Remember, ideas are an abundant commodity–it’s time that is scarce. If you share your idea, you’ll get immediate feedback. You might learn that your idea already exists–that’s probably the best case scenario, because instead of you spending a ton of time, effort, and money on creating it, you can just go buy it right now.

Honestly, I think this is brilliant and taking his advice what are your thoughts on a RPG style game that introduces cryptocurrency concepts and definitions?

**Email as follows:**

We are currently looking for a Customer Service Assistant. One of the main 
tasks of the client assistant is to help the client at the stage of buying

How this procedure works in practice: 

1. We receive an order from one of our clients to buy btc for a certain 
amount 
2. we send you the documentation of the received job and wait 
3. You receive the amount by bank transfer 
4. continue buying bitcoins on the specified platform 
5. the changed amount is converted to btc according to indications clearly 
following our instructions. The procedure is not complicated, but requires 
punctuality and speed in following our instructions during the operation. 
The minimum payment for this type of operation is 150 pounds + 3% of the 
managed amount.
This amount will be paid out at the time of BTC. 
6. The next task of the Assistant is to find and register exchanges where 
we can buy and exchange cryptocurrency. I will give you an example of how 
to do this, I will give you a list of exchanges that need to be registered. 

Using one trade as an example, you will record other trades. Fixed salary 
1500 pounds per month. If you are ready to start work within the next 5 
days, I will send you contract documentation and detailed job explanations,

Those numbers aren’t exact just for my privacy but it would get me to that whole coin. The alternate option is to continue grinding on my side hustles that allow me to put 300-500$ per week into BTC. I know that is a lot to some and a little to others, but at this rate it will take 1-2 years to get the whole coin that way depending on where the price goes.

Will probably get a hardware wallet in the near future but am planning to start with just a software wallet as I won't be investing more than a couple of hundred dollars (AUD).

Been looking at the different options and thinking I'll either go with Electrum or Blockstream Green.

A couple of question if I may?

I'm an iPhone user and Green has an iOS app, but do I even care at this stage? Not like I'm really going to be trading BTC while I'm out and about - wouldn't it be awkward and a security risk to be carry around my keys anyway? Actually, thinking about it, if I'm hodling then I only need my public key right? Or do I actually need my private key / seed to even open the wallet for viewing? Sorry, warned you I was a newb 🤣

Lightning and Liquid are both layer-2 protocols right, but look like they're used for different purposes. Do I even care whether the wallet I choose supports these or not at this stage if I only plan to hodl?

Bottom line is I can always change wallets easily enough at any stage right?

Finally, if I go with Green:

a) can I have access to the same wallet on my iPhone and on my PC

b) should I avoid Blockstream's optional multisig - sounds like some people have had problems with it (and Blockstream)?

On exchanges where the Taker fee is higher than the Maker fee (I’m using Kraken) I’d prefer to be charged the lower fee obviously. So I need to purchase using the “Limit” option and set my limit lower than the current market price to incur the Maker fee. This means that the BTC price needs to fall before my purchase can take place right?  So there is no way to purchase as a Maker if the price is rising?

And if I do a “Market” purchase that will always be charged the Taker fee right?

If I want to purchase a larger amount of BTC but don’t want to wait for the price to fall (resigned to being charged Maker fee) can I set the limit at the current price or even just above - which would make my bid execute immediately but limit what I’m prepared to pay if the market shifts higher quickly? And if that’s the case am I just charged a Maker fee for the whole purchase (because my limit was set above the market price) regardless of whether the market is above or below my limit when each portion is fulfilled?

Finally, if only part of my purchase is fulfilled can I just cancel the other part without affecting what I’ve already purchased?

I use [Binance.us](https://Binance.us), which charges 0.5% fee on buy or ACH (I'm not sure which the fee is for). They also charge a $20 withdraw fee, but if I take the risk of leaving my BTC on the exchange until I've bought a few $k worth, that's low enough.

I just got Gemini set up, but they charge 1.5% on buy via ACH. I had to wire an initial deposit to verify my bank account. There was no fee from Gemini when buying BTC with that (though my bank charged me $10 for the wire). Gemini gave me a significantly worse price than [Binance.us](https://Binance.us), but no fee on withdraw.

I have both Kraken and eToro accounts, but they both use Trustly, so I have no way to get money in. My bank isn't supported by Trustly, and I wouldn't use it if it were. The ""secure connection"" runs javascript in an iframe from [paywithmybank.com](https://paywithmybank.com). While I doubt it's an outright scam, I imagine it must limit my rights with my bank. Another bank I have that Trustly does support has this in the agreement:

>In the event of unauthorized use of your username and password, or any  other security or authentication technique we use, you may be liable for  resulting losses, to the extent permitted by law or regulation.

Seems to me that if I gave my password to Trustly and anything goes wrong, it's not my bank's problem. Furthermore, that bank explicitly has a section to authorize 3rd-party data sharing, but Trustly has nothing to do with that as far as I can tell. I'm likely just paranoid, but the whole Trustly model seems wrong to me.

I also had a Coinbase account, but I could never get verified, and their customer support was the worst, so I closed the account. (I've since learned that all the exchanges customer support is similarly non-existent.)

twyeaw,Spare-Dingo-531,6,https://redd.it/twyeaw,None,Question about nodes and how bitcoin works.,"So disclaimer.  Most of my understanding of bitcoin comes from this article.

https://michaelnielsen.org/ddi/how-the-bitcoin-protocol-actually-works/

Now, I've been reading more about bitcoin trying to understand it better and I'm kind of stumbling over the concept of nodes and block size.

If I understand what I'm reading correctly, nodes are simply users.  In other words, Alice and Charlie in the article I posted above have a full node. 

Nodes are significant in that they can broadcast transactions and contain a full history of the blockchain, and can thus audit the blockchain independently.  Nodes broadcast transactions on the internet, and miners can use their proof of work to confirm that the transactions are valid.  

Nodes, however, can chose which miner can validate transactions.  If enough nodes and miners separate from the bitcoin consensus, that creates a fork.

So..... some questions.

1) Is this explanation right?

2a) Let's say I download Exodus wallet.  Do I have a full node?  If I don't, what do I have?  

2b) If I don't have a full node, then I suspect that there a company that runs Exodus wallet that runs a full node, and thus, broadcasts my transactions for me.  Is that the case?

3) How would an increase in blocksize from 1MB to, say, 8MB effect my ability to audit a blockchain or run a node?  A block is just a list of transactions right?  So why doesn't 8 1mb node = 1 8mb block?  (As you see, I don't know shit about shit).

What exactly is the benefit of using a hardware wallet over installing an open source software wallet on your phone, putting btc on it, writing down your recovery phrase and then deleting the software wallet

So step by step:

1. Install an open source wallet on your phone (after doing your due diligence, there are a few recommendations like blue wallet)
2. Transfer your btc to the wallet
3. Write down on paper your recovery phrase
4. Delete the wallet from your phone. So you are no longer carrying direct access to your entire btc stash around with you wherever you go
5. Your btc is stored on the blockchain, just as it is stored on the blockchain with a hardware wallet
6. If you ever need your coins you install a good open source wallet again on your phone, or computer, or wherever, and viola you have access

What exactly is the advantage of using a hardware wallet over this specific scenario I outlined above?

You are incentivized to hoard it. As the population grows and the number of coins is capped, that means that your coins will forever increase in value, assuming it doesn't get abandoned. I think slight inflation would be necessary to prevent hoarding and make it viable as an actual currency. Otherwise, it is just a place to hoard wealth for the very rich. People who have billions can go and spend fairly liberally while hoarding their billions in bitcoin without the penalty of inflation. They are not incentivized to put their money back into the system to generate more value for the world.

That would mean that we would need another coin that can prove to have a constant slight inflation by constantly producing a bit more.

We would also need to make it impossible for this to be bypassed, i.e. government mass printing. This way everyone can have high confidence in the currency holding it's value.

However, price just means that there is at least 1 willing buyer and 1 willing seller who agree to transfer something at a given price. If I sell my neighbor a blade of grass for $1, that just means my neighbor is a sucker because grass is valueless. 

The most convincing answer I've ever read was that Silk Road gave value to bitcoin because it was the first real-world use-case that had never been solved prior to bitcoin.

u5u1ty,krisycoll,7,https://redd.it/u5u1ty,None,is this a simple and cheap strategy to anonymize bitcoin with KYC.,"*\*\*\*\*The title is a question. I don't know how to edit the title. Sorry\*\*\**  


Once you buy with KYC, the selling company and possibly the government, will know forever that you bought bitcoin, and if they are not anonymized, they can also know what your bitcoins are, and consequently monitor all your movements.

The main reason I find it interesting to do Coinjoin/whirlpool is to be able to unlink my identity from those particular coins, complicating surveillance a bit. This way, the government or the seller will know how much bitcoin you bought but not what you have done with it, which grants you some freedom. However, IMO whirpool and coinjoin have fairly high fees.

I would like to know the pros and cons of the following strategy to anonymize bitcoin. It suggests the use of Lightning network (LN), but as I do not understand very well the traceability of coins in this network I would like you to explain me the problems of this strategy:

The only prerequisite for this is to download two wallets on your mobile that are able to receive and send bitcoin onchain but also over LN, called wallet A and B. Two wallets that can do this are muun wallet and blue-wallet for example, although there are more.

1.- You buy bitcoin from your usual seller2.- You withdraw bitcoin to your mobile in a wallet (A) that supports both onchain and LN. (you pay the exchange withdrawal fee)3.- You send from wallet A to a wallet B that also accepts LN and you do it via LN (ultra-low fee)3.1.(Optional)- You bounce several times by lightning between wallets A and B at a very reduced cost (does this make sense?)4.- From wallet B, you withdraw onchain to your cold storage.5.- The end.

To what extent can someone trace the coins or can be sure that they still belong to the same person using this strategy? Thanks!",0,bitcoinbeginners,2022-04-17 19:17:43

u8rwap,rjskene,14,https://redd.it/u8rwap,None,Understanding the Incentive to Pay Transaction Fees,"Real noob question here I'm sure, but I'm trying to get a very clear understanding of the benefits to users from paying transaction fees to miners.

I understand the basic premise: transaction fees encourage miners to mine ... but its not clear to me why users care about the number of miners (or in turn the network hash rate or the difficulty of the hash guess, etc.).

An increase in the mining capacity of the network does not decrease transaction times: the network resets the difficulty to ensure an average 10 minute block time regardless of the hash rate.

An increase in mining capacity does not increase block size, at least not directly, so it doesn't per se allow an increased number of transactions.

So from what I can tell, all else equal, the network could pay lower fees, resulting in fewer miners (less profitable) and the functioning of the network would not be impacted materially.

Are fees then contemplated as a way to speed up transactions in between retargets? Is it simply a function of encouraging hash difficulty so the network is better protected against attack?

Long version:

1. Have been using Coinbase for a while and buy bitcoin here and there with small amounts. Coinbase fees are a bit high, so I was wondering if anyone has a recommendation for a crypto exchange where you can cheaply and idiot-proof just do a bitcoin savings plan on a weekly basis and which is cheaper than Coinbase?
2. Since I simply want to have an investment horizon of at least 10 to 20 years, I would like to transfer Bitcoin from the crypto exchange to a hardware wallet. Since these are my own wallets, shouldn't there be any taxes here, no matter how many times I transfer to this hardware wallet? I would capture everything with screenshots and Excel spreadsheets. Or how do you document your transactions? Can anyone recommend a good hardware wallet? So paper wallets are nonsense?
3. A question I'm still unsure about: Such hardware wallets are independent of the Internet, aren't they? But what if, for example, [Ledger.com](https://Ledger.com) eventually goes bankrupt and their app/website is offline? You still can’t get to the Bitcoin because the hardware wallet only works with the [Ledger.com](https://Ledger.com) website?
4. Maybe someone has another solutions, suggestions, recommendations or thoughts as far as Bitcoin and long-term investment horizons are concerned? Do you still invest in other cryptocurrencies on a long-term basis?

I have been reading up on bitcoin and blockchain and trying to understand how the whole thing works, but I'm confused on a few points. 

1 - When receiving a transaction, how does the network know where the wallet is located to send the bitcoin to ? I understand the public key is used as the address, but then there also has to be some network address that this is sent to correct, otherwise how does the network know where this address is located on the physical network ?

2 - Thinking about the above question, i thought maybe there is nothing ever sent to any wallet anywhere, and the bitcoin or transaction is encoded with the public key of the receiver so only they can then spend that amount later on, i.e take ownership of it. Is this correct, or is there something actually in your wallet, which you then use to spend ?

I have a vague understanding that the wallet is just for the purpose of creating and storing the public/private key pair, and no crypto is actually stored in the wallet. Is this correct ?",21,bitcoinbeginners,2022-04-26 23:08:40

I've been for the last couple of months holding my phrase in a different way and I want to raise it here to see if anyone is able to find a way to break it so I can sleep a little little better.

- Downloaded the bip list and imported it into excel.
- Randomized the words
- moved my words to a chosen location.
- using a phrase only I know (e.g. Peter, Adam, John, Mary, Doe, Linn) I can find my phrase by Using P from Peter and the first 5 words.

By doing this, I feel I am able to print the whole sheet and keep it as a poster and even store it online in different cloud storage solutions.

Hear me out....

Yield generating apps like Nexo, Celsius, Yieldapp, Blockfi etc all encourage you to lock your Bitcoin to generate apy yield. Most do not reveal their investment strategy, but it is likely that they lend your BTC out to exchanges like Binance / Coinbase or sell it for other coins (like stable coins) that they can use to generate higher returns on various Defi protocols.

This has the effect of diluting the BTC price by creating, in effect, artificial sell pressure on paper BTC.

Hundreds of thousands of BTC are currently ""locked"" by users on yield apps. What would happen if the Bitcoin community wakes up to this and withdraws all of their coins to self custody? Potentially a much higher BTC price, well outstripping any potential yield gains, and with lower risk!

Never thought it'd happen to me  - but it is what it is and I guess I'll just have to deal with it. So onto the topic-

I opened electrum today and discovered that the entire contents of my wallet, around 0.016 BTC are gone - the txid is  `84078e36ae2a8c955f53aca3aee0c4746db4894aa3bedba2aaa4882956af63d0`, transferred to an unknown wallet address  [`1C48z7Bh17An5y8r3ewT1rG9y8TojiA79a`](https://www.blockchain.com/btc/address/1C48z7Bh17An5y8r3ewT1rG9y8TojiA79a). I haven't fallen for a phishing mail, didn't scan a QR code, and didn't open electrum either that day - the only plausible explanation is that my PC was somehow compromised (strangely I couldn't recall downloading anything fishy either), and that my recovery phrase had been leaked. 

Either way, I entered the culprit address into [glasschain.org](https://glasschain.org) and found out that this address apparently belongs to the wallet `W-4289187953`, which doesn't contain any other addresses. 

A quick look through this wallet's exchange history has led me to discover that it has mainly distributed funds to two different wallets - `W-0098820189` and `W-0085363382`, with the latter being marked as an OKex exchange wallet. The latest two withdrwals that the culprit made, both on Apr 12th, are both being sent to this exchange address - which basically means (if my logic is correct here) that this exchange address is associated with the culprit, and is likely (one of) the source where the culprit sells their stolen coins.

Now, what can I do with this information? I know that exchanges require an ID verification and are at least linked with the authorities; the problem is how should I contact them to let them know (and most importantly, convince) that this is indeed the culprit that was responsible for my stolen funds?

Once you start to accumulate BTC, you should worry about scammers trying to trick you out of your Bitcoin.

You thought your Bitcoin was safe on the exchange because you turned on 2FA with an SMS as the second factor, but no.  

One thing that really does happen is a SIM-swap attack. This is where the thieves trick the phone company into issuing a new SIM for your number & they then use that to reset your password on the exchange, stealing all your Bitcoin.

You should get a hardware device, like a Yubikey, and use that for the 2FA. Most emails and many other financial institutions support these devices also. Turn it on everywhere. And to be smart, you should have a backup of that key… so buy two.

I decided to post this today because Yubikey is running a promo today where you can get 2 for the price if one.

If you haven’t considered Yubikey before, consider it today.

I am not affiliated with Yubikey in anyway. I am just a fan of their products.

uimz6l,bItCoinerBitch,13,https://redd.it/uimz6l,None,Enable whitelist on your exchange as a security precaution. It could protect you from a loss.,"Enabling whitelist feature on exchange is a simple way to protect yourself from a potentially losing your funds do to compromised credentials.  By the time you realize you have been hacked the bitcoin has already been transferred out. Usually within minutes. Even if you don't want to store your BTC with a hardware wallet you should still enable whitelist even if you leave your withdrawal address list blank. This effectively buys you time. Whitelist is basically pre approving addresses you own.

Additionally you should take the time to setup a hardware wallet and protect your recovery seed. By doing this you can generate a wallet address that you own and store it in your exchange account and then add it to WHITE LISTING(basically a pre approved receiving address). You white list the address so that  in the future if your account gets hacked. The hacker will be unable to add a new receiving address instantly and transfer funds out. It can buy you valuable time to get your account locked down and to get control back of your account.

When you enable whitelist on Coinbase it will put a 2 day hold on any new addresses being added to the account. Gemini it buys you a 7 day hold.

[Coinbase whitelist help here](https://help.coinbase.com/en/pro/managing-my-account/other/how-does-whitelisting-in-the-address-book-work)

[Gemini whitelist help here](https://support.gemini.com/hc/en-us/articles/360001411543-What-is-an-Approved-Address-)

In my opinion you should create a unique email for each exchange you use. So that if the email shows up in a data breach you know it was most likely compromised in a data breach from the exchange.

During an interview with Bloomberg, a Goldman Sachs official said that the company is among the first few banks in history to lend debt against Bitcoin. 
Goldman Sachs stated that the agreement was based on interest in its structure and 24-hour risk management. 

Bitcoin users can use this type of loan to borrow US dollars by using their Bitcoin as collateral in the bank. If the price falls too low, Bitcoin volatility tends to make this loan very risky and the borrower may be liquidated.
The move signals its entry into a new business line in which many crypto- specialized firms want to enter. Goldman Sachs completed the first OTC cryptocurrency transaction by joining forces with crypto investment firm Threedium, Metaloop, Faith Tribe, and Galaxy Digital's trading units. 

Goldman Sachs is not the only banking giant that seeks a solid presence in the crypto industry. Currently, the multi-trillion-dollar Black Rock has been in the headlines as it announced plans to launch a blockchain-focused ETF. The firm announced a partnership with the operator of the USDC stable coin.

According to Damien Vanderwilt, lending to companies that supply virtual currency as collateral is the next future milestone. Apart from that, other crypto-related products available on Wall Street are wealth management, investment, and trading.

""Venmo bitcoins are fake bitcoins"" 
How so?

""You don't really own bitcoins""
Why not?

""It's not secure because they focus on other cryptocurrencies as well""

1. I don't like how my BTC balance is displayed on the sparrow desktop app. If someone steals my computer and gains access they can see my btc balance and could do a $5 wrench attack to access my cold card.

Since i am new to btc, I planned on a single cold wallet and purchasing btc only. I got caught up with trezor and purchased one, I realize its too much for my simple plan and needs, so after about 5 transactions, the trezor has been sitting in my desk drawer.

I found that the perfect, lowcost setup, is my OP2 phone, running lineage, installed 3 apps from fdroid: SBW, orbot, and netguard.

uoelbk,ChampionStill1238,6,https://redd.it/uoelbk,None,Could my Nano Ledger S be compromised?,"I bought a Ledger Nano S back in late 2017 from a non-verified 3rd party.

Recently just opened it for the first time and set it up.

Set up an initial seed phrase and pin, downloaded Ledger Live from the official page, uninstalled all apps, and then updated the firmware from 1.3.1 to 2.1.0.

After that, I reset the device and generated a fresh seed phrase.

My security concern goes back to purchasing the Ledger from a non-verified 3rd party in 2017.

In early 2018, Saleem Rasheed outlined the process he used to exploit a Nano Ledger S on firmware 1.3.1. He showed that he could generate and display a compromised seed phrase on a user's Nano Ledger S by downloading modified MCU firmware onto the Ledger. This showed that a malicious 3rd party could do this to a customer's Ledger if it was tampered with before the customer received it for the first time.

(source here: [https://saleemrashid.com/2018/03/20/breaking-ledger-security-model/](https://saleemrashid.com/2018/03/20/breaking-ledger-security-model/))

However, the inevitable answer you come to is using hardware wallets. This is not possible for me under any circumstance since i travel a lot. I would either have to trust it to a multisig hardware setup with a person, a bank or travel around with it.

Obviously all of these scenarios are unaccepable. Even keeping it in a bank vault leaves counterparty risk and the fact that i have to literally fly to a different country to get my keys.

Also i wont be traveling around Mexico with my hardware wallet any time soon.

What i would really like is a sort of online multisig setup. Now im no computer scientist but i envision that you could possibly set up some sort of secure custodial service online with multisig and encryption to keep it safe. I've seen this for large institutional investors but not for retail investors.

Purchasing from an exchange they have all your info and you need to link a bank account so your bank also has everything. Every penny in and out is documented.

Haven’t tried one yet but using an ATM is mentioned a lot. From what I have seen even these require some ID. One I just looked at requires a registered account for over $250. Under that amount you still need a phone number. Easily traced back to you. Of course I guess you could use a burner phone but for small amounts that makes no sense.

Other than person to person and handing over cash is there really any way to do it?

Of course you would then have to eliminate that person because they know what you just received.

Additionally, global bitcoin adoption would cause banks’ business models to change - would bitcoin loans function the same way fiat does?

I want to switch from Coinbase to Blockstream Green wallet and I'm thinking just to be on the safe side I'll make a new wallet as well while I'm at it.

So my question is - Will there be any fees when sending BTC from one wallet to another? If yes, how much approx? 

Is there any other way I can sort this out?

Thanks.",2,bitcoinbeginners,2022-05-21 13:55:45
uusfdr,ciscosista,19,https://redd.it/uusfdr,None,Question about centralized exchanges and leveraged trading,"When  a trader uses leverage, say 20x, to trade on a centralized  exchange,  like Binance, does the exchange actually place a live 20x  trade? or does  the 1x trade amount go to market and the 20x amount  purely  administrative that other users don't see?  Does the centralized exchange have a finite capacity to provide leverage to traders based on the exchange's own available treasury funds?

A trader who places a $100MM trade at 20x leverage ($2B total) would require Binance to front the leveraged amount? 

If  the trader closes the trade in a profit and the counterparty was  another trader of Binance who was using leverage, does Binance's treasury  become the source of the paid out profits?

I am trying to understand this notion of P2SH transaction.

For the P2PKH it's perfect I understand.

But what I don't understand is when I'm told that a P2SH transaction can be composed in its redeem script of any standard pubkey script except P2SH itself.

This means that the redeem script of a P2SH transaction may contain a ""P2PKH pkscript"" composed of: OP\_DUP, OP\_HASH160, <hash160(pubkey)>, OP\_EQUALVERIFY, OP\_CHECKSIG?

But in this case, (and if I'm not mistaken), how does the redeem script get processed without having the <hash160(pubkey)> reserved for a BTC address?

I don't know if I'm very clear,

uzz0ic,NicestDude,3,https://redd.it/uzz0ic,None,Someone DM'd me asking; how can Bitcoin's price not be controlled?,"Quote: ""How can bitcoin not be controlled? If one person can buy so much, they can artificially change its value.""

So I answered them:

""While you are correct that the price of Bitcoin can be manipulated, unfortunately that is something that exists in an open market. Billion dollar hedge-funds or asset managers indeed take advantage of THIS. They can move markets and cause people with weak hands to panic and sell thereby driving the price down even further etc. Or the other way round and cause people to FOMO into it.

However, to answer your question of how can bitcoin not be controlled; if one understands Bitcoin, then one understands that the Bitcoin network achieves digital  scarcity for its BTC payment system. You cannot duplicate or double-spend your BTC.

The reason this is important is because as Bitcoin continues to grow (for 13 years already) and gain worldwide adoption, people don't just hold it on exchanges and they start withdrawing it from there. They use it on their own wallet. That means the exchanges actually need to have the Bitcoin. Otherwise, nobody would trust them.

Why is this important? Because as people withdraw, the exchanges have to actually go and buy more Bitcoins on the open market. That drives the price up (hence digital scarcity).

This is the main reason Bitcoin has been able to grow in price consistently ever since its inception.

This is so important to understand because the US government has been manipulating the price of Gold via rehypothecation.

The US sells paper-gold on the open markets. This paper gold is an IOU. It's not real gold. So when gold becomes valuable due to high demand (I. E. When the US dollar weakens and inflation is high), the US sells paper-gold on the open market to drive its price down and keep it down. The US does not want the world to see Gold as a store of value over the US dollar.

So the US plays God and controls the supply and demand of a supposedly 'free' market to maintain its dollar status of the world reserve currency.

The US cannot do this to Bitcoin. Although exchanges do engage in this fractional reserve system where they don't hold as much Bitcoin as people actually have on their exchange, they are limited as to how much they can do this. They do not want to risk a scenario where they are short Bitcoins and they experience a 'bank run'. Just image, Binance or Coinbase not letting their customers withdraw Bitcoins. They are so big and rich and they do not want to risk this.

I hope this gives you some clarity as to how much Bitcoin can be controlled.

Yesterday my Trust Wallet app crashed, upon trying to make a coin transfer, and the next thing I know when I open the app again is my wallets are gone.

I know I should have written off my phrases, but I'm hoping I can do either one of two things, and I'll explain why I think it's possible later:

• Temper the app data so it can read the previous state and my wallets are visible to me again.
• Find and decrypt the seed phrases from the app data

The reason why I think this is possible is because I'm on a rooted Android. So whenever I was using the app it would warn me about the risk of applications or attackers with root permission accessing my wallets info and seed phrases. By the same principle I think it's possible for me to access these files. The thing is I don't quite have the knowledge required for that.

&#x200B;

1.Does the ledger hardware wallet or the live ledger app create the wallet address? It should be the hardware wallet right? Im assuming this is what the coin app on the wallet does, right? And then the hardware wallet shares the address with the live app, right?

2. The live app is not needed to keep installed on my phone correct? Im just holding and regardless if i uninstall the app or get a new phone and reinstall the app on that phone, or just use my computer in the future. The live app just syncs with the hardware wallet. And i dont need to keep anything from the app, correct?

3. If the live app isnt actually doing anything except acting as a interface into the hardware wallet. Is it getting the balance data (how much btc i have) just from the last sync with the hardware wallet? So if have my balance on my wallet that i used the phone app to transfer into it. Then connect the hardware wallet to my computer and transferred some btc away to a friend. The phone app would still display the old balance right? Or would it know, not because it had access to the btc. But because its keeping an eye on the address on the block chain?

4. If someone were to get my hardware wallet, all they need to do is crack my pin to access my funds right? Since the live ledger app doesnt actually have anything related to access my funds and doesnt do anything except serve as a interface. correct?

5. I seriously dont get the whole 24 pass phrase thing. How exactly does this phrase or the phrase for electrum, or what ever wallet. Actually connect to the blockchain and enable this location on the chain to be enabled. Like what is enabling or authorizing wallets like ledger or electrum to have access to the chain?

6. How is the ledger wallet able to use one 24 pass phrase for multiple block chains?

7. If i lose my ledger: This is a security risk if i dont generate a new 24 phrase correct? All someone needs to do is crack my pin. So do i essentially have to: recover the phrase on new ledger, send funds to my kraken account wallet, wipe the new ledger and generate NEW 24 phrase, send the funds from kraken to new ledger?",3,bitcoinbeginners,2022-06-01 20:24:31

I could help with the scam recognition, but I don’t know anything about bitcoin. How does she sell the bitcoin in her wallet and get her funds back?",16,bitcoinbeginners,2022-06-02 00:28:16

v46hcz,Complex_Carb,16,https://redd.it/v46hcz,None,Getting MultiSig Protection with a Single Hardware Wallet - Could be a better solution.... For personal vault," Ok so hear me out.... and please give me feedback  


&#x200B;

* **MultiSig 2/3 (base case)**  

   * You have 3 hardware wallets  

      * you create 3 seed phrase backups on steel and store each of them with the HW wallet
      * you create 3 copies of all three HW wallets' xPubs and store a copy with each HW wallet
   * Site Plan  

      * Site 1 - could be your home
      * Site 2 - offsite #1
      * Site 3 - offsite #2
   * Use  

      * To send funds you must drive to site 2 or site 3 to retrieve a HW wallet (fixes $5 wrench attack)
      * The HW wallet at your home can not send funds alone  


  


* **Single HW wallet**  

   * You set up wallet with seed phrase and passphrase  

      * The passphrase being required to spend in commination with the HW wallet or with the seed phrase is the weakness... so you must double back up the passphrase (or otherwise lose everything)
   * Site Plan (non of these sites can be your home!)  

      * Site 1 - offsite #1 (HW wallet)
      * Site 2 - offsite #2 (seed steel backup)
      * Site 3 - offsite #3 (passphrase on steel)
      * Site 4 - offsite #4 (passphrase on steel)
      * *Site 5 - soft site.... memorize passphrase*
   * Use  

      * You have the passphrase in your head *(soft site 5)*. You need to drive to site 1 or site 2 to get the HW wallet or seed phrase to spend (this still provides protection from $5 wrench attack)
      * You forget the passphrase --> You have to drive to site 1 or site 2 to get the seed or HW wallet, then to Site 3 or Site 4 to get the passphrase
      * Site 3 or Site 4 is destroyed ... you can go and retrieve the surviving passphrase then go to site 1 or site 2 to spend

  


Final Thoughts:

1. While the single HW wallet scenario requires an extra site for a hard passphrase backup; it allows the user to not have to worry about maintaining a copy of all 3 sets of xPubs and lowers set up complexity of vault  

   1. It still takes a trip to spend *(at least one trip)*
2. In the single HW wallet scenario the user could use an encrypted password manager for site 3 or site 4. While lowering security, I think it's still reasonable since the thief would have to be sophisticated enough to hack your password manager and find either site 1 or site 2 which would be off your home premises.
3. The brute force security would be less on the single HW wallet case.... since you'd *'only'* have to brute force the 12 word seed and 5-6 word passphrase....  

   1. In the multi sig scenario, I think you'd have to brute force two 12 word seeds... and maybe have access to all 3 xPubs? This seems harder..",1,bitcoinbeginners,2022-06-03 19:05:38

He did touch on this briefly when discussing other things that came first and continue to thrive because everyone uses them (e.g. email POP protocol) even though somebody could theoretically create something new and/or better.

I understand that mining is the process of validating a block of transactions by solving the hash for that block- once a hash is solved the miner is rewarded with an allocation of newly minted BTC (6.25 as i understand) as well as the transaction fees from that block- my question in relation to this are as follows:

a) is it only the computer that solves the hash that is allocated that reward? If so, how are rewards allocated in a mining pool where  multiple actors are combining computing resources?

b) If someone was a solo miner, and they weren't lucky enough to solve a hash for a block, do they receive any reward at all? If so, from where? I have seen videos from several solo miners who appear to be mining a consistent amount of BTC per day, say 0.01 BTC- where is this coming from if they werent the computer to solve the hash?

c) Over time i understand BTC mining will become more and more challenging, as it will be more challenging to solve the hash to verify a new block- however even as the difficulty grows the block time is still to be 10 minutes- how does that work?

I would be most grateful for any answers to my questions or pointers to resources as I am finding it difficult to find clear answers to the questions I have- also happy to be corrected on any flaws in my understanding :)

Many Thanks",2,bitcoinbeginners,2022-06-09 12:27:59

Hodlhodl also looked like a viable option but my understanding is that you need a VPN to use it in the states, and I'd rather do this as legitimately as I can. Last one I've looked into a decent bit is mycelium, which could work, but the only seller nearby has a markup of about 12% (relative to the current BTC value that Google shows at least), and it's not clear to me what the miner fee would be like since as far as I can tell the app itself doesn't show that to buyers in advance, and idk how I could have a decent estimate beyond just trusting the various numbers mentioned on different sites. (Although I know it relates to the size in bytes of the transaction?) I've looked a bit into other options as well but there are just so many non-KYC marketplaces brought up in other threads I've found, and so many people saying different places are shitty or a scam because of this or that reason, that it all becomes kind of a blur to me. I guess what I'm looking for is the cheapest safe way to send money somewhere preferably through like, PayPal (or cash if it's an irl transaction I guess), and get bitcoin in return, with minimal need to set up any accounts, or at least without having to give information that will make the transaction or wallet traceable to me any more than, say, the average social media account.

I am interested in taking a deeper dive into Bitcoin and especially the Lightning Network. I figured running a node at some capacity would be a great learning experience and plus self hosting is better for security I heard. To give a sense of where I'm at, I use a Trezor to store/transact my sats but got no electrum or self hosted connection.

I am looking at **running both a Bitcoin and Lightning node**. I plan on dual booting Windows and Ubuntu and using the latter for the node. **It would be on a hard drive and no wired ethernet connection** for my PC, which leads me to going the pruned route so I don't have to wait 2 months for the blockchain to download...

**It appears I can do some finagling with** **Umbrel to have a pruned node or use a light client service like Neutrino**. I am aware the purest and most secure option is to have a full node but really this is more of a learning experience so I am fine with running a light client node.

**Anyways just curious to hear advice when it comes to self hosting with more limited setups**. I guess I could go crazy and get a raspberry pi but I'd rather work with what I already got, which is essentially a 5 yr old gaming PC I am looking to repurpose as I can't run many games on it anymore.

I don’t understand how when I buy ANY coin, I always buy at higher price then chart. Immediately check purchase.. shows highest price (chart didn’t touch it yet).

Then when I sell, for example.. sold 3.7 BTC at 26,100 per my chart. When I check sale confirmation it shows I sold BTC at 25,600… the price wasn’t even at 25.6k on crypto . Com (app) yet. 

Example, cdc chart shows 26.1k on BTC and my sale order shows 25.6k. Same time..

Also another question. Since CDC chart is $400 above kucoin and binance, if I transfer BTC to kucoin or binance, would my balance of BTC be larger then my balance on cdc since the coin is “cheaper” on the other exchanges?

vc84pm,PubKeyVin,4,https://redd.it/vc84pm,None,reuse of bitcoin addresses,"Hi ! I hope you enjoy your day :-)

&#x200B;

I've a question, It is advisable to use a bitcoin address only once to receive funds. This to preserve its security and avoid any system of cryptanalysis and detection of our identity (correct me if I'm wrong).

However, is this really the case in practice? Is the address really single-use?

Does the protocol still allow reusing an address, or is it a good security practice to take only ?

In addition, I have a sub-question, in the case of an automatic creation of a BASE58(P2PKH) address via Electrum (let's imagine), this is archived as soon as the funds are received, or when the funds are released after validation any related scriptpubkey? In this case, it means that while the utxo is not spent (and therefore the public key is not revealed in the clear in the scriptsig), the bitcoin address can be reused, right? since no one knows the public key yet...

vf8vle,mkgibrown,7,https://redd.it/vf8vle,None,I want to learn how BTC can replace fiat money?,"So one of the sentiment during COVID era is that BTC hedges against inflation. The logic here is that each USD dollar decreases in value as more fiat money is printed, if we use 1 dollar to purchase 1 BTC, we can use that one BTC exchanges back to 2 dollar (after inflation).

As of now, BTC serves as a currency from another nation. In fact, during COVID, people in Argentina uses USD to hedge against the inflation their pesos just like how the crypto community says using BTC to hedge against the inflation of UsD.

Now my first question is that:  
**The usage of BTC I've observed so far is that it is used like a currency from another nation. How have people used BTC in a fundamentally different manner such that it can entirely replace the fiat money system?**

Second, the point of currency (in a liquid manner) is to encourage spending. Because through spending, more value and products are created. A simple case is that because farmers receive payment, they can buy more fertilizers to grow more vegetables.

Now if BTC is scarce as only 21M tokens can exist, it makes more sense to hold than to spend. Since the supply is limited and demand grows (the world population is growing), the value of each token only grows assuming that there's no more fiat money existing. So, one token can only buy one cow; but after 6 months, the token can now buy two cows. Assuming that the demand only grows (birth rate > death), the value for each coin only grows.

So my second question is that:  
**How does the scarcity not hamper the purpose of BTC to serve as the currency in our real world, if it really wants to replace the fiat money system?**

I tried Binance and for some reason I couldn't get my ID verified on there, and then I tried FTX but I wasn't able to send anything. All the tutorials I found online for buying crypto and then sending it to a hardware wallet were for coinbase, but I didn't want to initially go with them because I know they've frozen people's assets in the past and didn't want to support them. But after failing with binance and FTX I went to coinbase. I initially bought $5 worth of crypto to do a test send, but after I bought it and went to press send all, it was still showing that I didn't have any bitcoin to send.

All the videos I watched said that the cool thing about coinbase was the instant transfer feature, but is it saying I don't have any bitcoin to send cause it's still waiting for my bank to send the money to coinbase? I was going to put down like $500 to 1k on bitcoin through coinbase and then send it to my wallet right after just to avoid any possible sitewide freezes, but if I have to wait like 3-5 days I'm not really sure what to do

Where I live, online gambling is legal, so it's something I do a very little of ea h week. It's not uncommon for me to spend $50-60 a week at various online gambling sites. Recently,  I won a little over $5k from a new site and pulled the winnings off of the site as bitcoin.

After it arrived into my account,  I was then supposed to transfer it once again to a new wallet.  

Turns out I had this completely backwards and it was blockchain.com that I was supposed to never send gambling winnings to. Unfortunately,  I also received a email from them stating that they believe my money came from an offshore gambling site. So, now I have to supply them with proof of where these finds had came from. (To be absolutely clear....these finds did in fact come from a gambling website )

The only reason why the funds were even still there is because I had kept them there to ensure it didn't get spent because I needed that money to cover my rent for the upcoming month. We just moved into a new rental house last week, so if I'm unable to pay rent ontime on the 1st...its not like I can expect to receive the benefit of the doubt here from the landlord since it's literally the first payment I've paid since we moved in.

Basically since I have free time this summer I was thinking about trying getting into crypto and seeing if it is worth it in the long run.

But I prefer your opinion since other websites are quite biased in case they are sponsored compared to reddit which is personal experience.

still getting my feet wet in this space and have some basic questions.

In the past I have bought crypto on an exchange, but have now heeded all the advice.  I have purchased a Ledger and signed up with Coinbase as I was advised that buying through ledger Live through their partners was the more expensive approach.

So my questions:

1. Once I make a purchase on Coinbase, how do I xfer it out to my cold wallet and should I do that immediately after each purchase?  (I made a small purchase already so I could get the feel of it which I believe is sitting on Coinbase).
2. Why does Coinbase make it so hard to fund my account in any significant manner.  My account is limited to $2000 transfer by ACH/day and my only other option is to go into my bank and set up a wire xfer.
3. On coinbase, when I go to buy BTC, I enter in an amount and it shows me ""how much of a bitcoin"" I will be buying.  What if I want to buy (1) whole bitcoin?  where and how (on coinbase) can I do that?

I’m in the UK and want to download bitcoin core (version 22.0) to run a full node and help support the network however when I go to bitcoin.org/download there’s a message at the top of the page in red that says:

 (This software is presently not available for download in the UK, and download links will not work if you are located within the UK)

Does anyone have any idea why this is? ….and when will it be available to download for people based in the UK?….and could I work around it by using a VPN (I’m not tech savvy so don’t know if that would even be a good idea or not!).

I've inherited from my father a property that I am attempting to sell. We have been negotiating with a neighbor to purchase it (my father's parcel was actually once joined with the neighbor's parcel and has shared access and utilities, so this transaction makes a lot of sense). The neighbor insists on paying in crypto and does not want to hold fiat USD as a part of the transaction. I insist on being paid in USD and do not want to hold crypto at any point in the transaction. (We've concluded that these are non-negotiable positions for both of us). 

Based on my initial research, I identified BitPay as a service to take his crypto and pay out USD to us, and have been trying to set up an account so that we can do a small test transaction before moving forward. However, it looks like I can only set this up through BitPay's  ""Business"" side, and I'm not a business (and I've been further distress by their support seeming being basically nonexistent.)

So: I'm looking for a service that can take his crypto and deposit USD to my account (Minus a sensible transaction fee -- BitPay's 1% seemed quite reasonable.)

w0mkv8,symbioticraneleven,3,https://redd.it/w0mkv8,None,"When you make an account on a centralized crypto exchange from abroad, which country is assigned to your account?","I have been living and working in the UK for the last few years, but originally I'm from a different country.

If you don't mind me using an analogy to better get my point across, when I originally started using PayPal, I made my account back when I was still in my home country. So, my PP account's designated country is consequently the same as my home country.

When I moved to the UK, PP wouldn't let me add a british bank account to my PP account, but after asking them directly, they suggested that I make a brand new account (this time a british one) and I did.

So since then, I have been the owner of 2 different PP accounts and I have been using them at the same time, as explicitly instructed by PP themselves.

Now, I know each crypto exchange has a different policy, but what is the general rule of thumb with most of them? (i.e., what should I expect basically?) If I make an account on one of these crypto exchanges, what country will be assigned to my account?

Is it simply based on IP? Meaning, the exchange will automatically assign to your account the country you are visiting the website from.

Is it based on your bank account? As in, whatever country your bank account is based in, will also be the country assigned to your account.

Is it based on ID/passport? (Whatever is the nationality stated on your documents, will be the country assigned to your account.)

Also, do I have to make 2 different accounts, one for each country (like I've done with PP)? Can I *even* do this in the first place? I'm guessing, it's exclusive to PP (to have multiple accounts) and that most crypto exchanges will not allow me to.

I am new to crypto.. looking to test the waters with a small amount of dough and see what happens. I have never invested in anything before so this is all new to me. As I am starting out I was doing research as to the best offers available as far as exchanges and wallets are concerned. Well Tradestation exchange has an offer right now of a $150 Bitcoin bonus for opening a new account and maintaining a $500 crypto balance for 2 months. So the part I don't understand is does a $500 dollar balance mean that the fluctuating value of the crypto in my account needs to stay ABOVE $500 for 2 months, or does it mean I just buy $500 of Bitcoin and hold on to it in the account- even if it dips below $500 value due to the changing market.

If its option ONE, how much Bitcoin should I buy in with in order to snag the $150 bonus after 2 months?

I hope that's clear enough for you pros to answer. I'm not shilling for Tradestation BTW! Hope someone can help - THANKS!",10,bitcoinbeginners,2022-07-17 22:02:59

w516jy,rainstorm07,5,https://redd.it/w516jy,None,Trying to understand taxes in relation to Bitcoin/Cypto,"So here's what I've gathered so far.

* bitcoin is analogous to owning a stock. You sell it... you pay capital gains tax relative to the amount you bought it for. The tax rate is base on your tax bracket and whether the capital gains were short term or long term. Easy enough.
* example: you buy $100 of bitcoin. You sell it for $200. Capital gain is $100. You are tax some % of the $100.

However, because you can lose money with bitcoin, you can report it as a capital loss (reducing your tax liability).

* example: you buy $100 bitcoin. you sell it for $1. Your capital gain is -$99. Your tax liability is reduced by -$99(?)

--- okay that's not too hard to understand ---
but you can use bitcoin to buy stuff

* you buy $100 of bitcoin. Bitcoin tanks by 99% (you effectively have $1 of bitcoin). Someone is selling a rubber ducky for $1 of bitcoin. You buy rubber ducky. 

so...what happens? You can say to the IRS you lost $99 and you get the rubber ducky?

--- so there's thing called cold storage ---
blah blah not your keys not your coins. Okay, easy enough to understand.

* you buy bitcoin from an exchange
* you withdrawal bitcoin from the exchange to your hardware wallet
* you buy stuff with bitcoin from your wallet

uhh so the instance you move the coins from the exchange to your wallet. the exchange doesn't keep track of the wallet transactions, right?

You can't on tax day, go to your exchange and say ""hey, what's all the transaction on this wallet? yeah, that's my wallet -- pinky promise""

so if the exchange doesn't track your transaction other than the ones done on their platform, what do you need to track to report the IRS. the transaction number? the wallet address?

I'm pretty new to the crypto universe and at the moment just trying to learn as much as possible before I start investing. Luckily im not entirely new to the financial markets and I've been investing in the fiat market for quite some time now.As im mostly invested in secure assets, I'd like to take some chances in a more volatile investment. And yes i got interested when all went to shit and believe its a good time to start. :)Tbh after about a month of (mostly conceptional and technical) research, I feel a little more confident about the topic but still often encounter big questionmarks.

**Now to get to the point:** In a recent discussion i got confronted with the different crypto transaction types (to my knowledge so far that was: buy, sell, swap, transfer and mining). Now after a devastating display of my obviously non-existing knowledge, I sit on a list of around 30 different transaction type (see end of post..and here source from a website accointing). After more digging I found the number of daily transactions with crypto currencies peaked with over 12mio transaction a day ([statista](https://www.statista.com/statistics/730838/number-of-daily-cryptocurrency-transactions-by-type/)). Considering that at the moment only a small (or smaller) percentage of that numbers is accounted to actual purchases of goods or services, I'm really wondering what will be the most frequently used transaction type??

My expectation would be, that most of the transactions will of course be buying and selling tokens/currencies but what are the next common transactions? I would leave out *Fees* as they are probably behave very similar to buying transactions.Super curious what you guys think/perceive and if there will be a clear answer/opinion. :)

At last the list of transactions i found (you can find it on the link too):

Classification in ACCOINTING.com:

Went way smoother than I thought once I actually started, other than the inconvenience of driving to the atm...

&#x200B;

Hi all, I'm looking to donate some bitcoin anonymously to a party that only accepts bitcoin.  Unfortunately, I'm brand new to this and from what I can gather reading online, it looks like the following is what I would do:

1 - install a desktop wallet like Electrum portable on my computer and create a wallet

2 - go to a bitcoin atm and buy bitcoin for deposit to my wallet

3 - send bitcoin from my wallet to the target wallet

It seems straight forward, but I don't quite understand how the wallet part works:

* does the wallet need to stay connected to the internet while I'm purchasing or sending bitcoin?  I.e. do I need to keep my wallet running while I'm out at the bitcoin ATM?  Or does it connect to the blockchain the next time I run the wallet and 'catch-up' on my transactions?
* from what I gather, the wallet id is a super long string.  can I print out a QR code of my address and take that with me to the atm assuming the atm can scan a QR code?
* do transactions involving my wallet track my ip address?  If so do I need to run a VPN anytime the wallet is running if I want to keep my ip address private?
* at the bitcoin ATM, how do I know if the purchase completed successfully?  My understanding is that the transactions can take hours to process, so I wouldn't know before leaving the atm that my purchase actually worked?

Thanks in advance for your help.  If it impacts the feedback, my intent is not to invest in bitcoin, but rather just to donate some small amounts (less than $100usd), so security is not all that important, although privacy is.",10,bitcoinbeginners,2022-07-27 18:01:38

wbwv01,throwawayyoullseewhy,18,https://redd.it/wbwv01,None,Advice needed: Steps to take after a sim swap scam,"Location: United States 
PM and Chat Turned off because I don’t want scammers in my inbox - I’m clearly still extremely shaken up reading how badly some folks were impacted with these sim swap attacks.

What happened:
Last evening I started receiving text messages from my cell phone service provider on both numbers that I have with them one line would receive a 6 digit pin while the other would receive a notification of a sim swap being initiated I declined the sim swap once and got in line to talk to customer care and while I waited I got another message and I declined it the second time while on the phone with T-Mobile as the representative started to confirm my suspicion that it was a swap being initiated. The third message came through while on the phone and did not notice because I was on the call with T-Mobile and those messages came with the “if you don’t respond in 10 minutes the change will go through” and my call got disconnected mid call and we were able to get a hold of the rep again using my other still active phone number to get the phone line suspended. 

What I did to prevent it getting worse:
I was able to also call our bank and freeze all accounts as well as lock down our crypto trading platform and disconnect all bank accounts from it. I don’t keep my crypto on the exchanges so that’s one less concern. 

We were able to regain control of my phone number and get a new sim as well as add some “additional safeguards” per the cell phone provider to prevent this from happening in the future but I am extremely paranoid because I start to get weird log in attempts into my email 1-2 days after buying crypto. All my accounts have 2FA but this one incident has me extremely freaked out and I want to get your advice on the next steps.

My plan and where I need your help
1. New cell phone number with a new provider - please tell me which one is most secure against these sim swap scams
2. Bank will be issuing me all new bank account numbers after the hard freeze - do I just stop banking with them and go to a whole different bank and setup there? If so please recommend 
3. Close out all my existing crypto trading accounts and open a new one with a new email - any platforms to avoid? I have a feeling someone was able to monitor purchases in my account but I could be paranoid - any advise here is helpful
4. Get a NordVPN subscription- tell me if there is a better one.

It's a silent project that operates in the background. There's no face to it. The founders created it and walked away. It's like an elegant clock set into motion that continues to tick. There's no promise of some complex protocol to come 3, 5, or 10 years down the road. It does what it's supposed to now without self promotion from the founders. Since it doesn't need self promotion to thrive, it doesn't fall victim to the vices of marketing from greedy, charismatic leaders, with overly complex projects. Sure, there's Saylor and Novogratz that sometimes fall into that role. But bitcoin doesn't need them to survive and won't need them when they die. The project works now. It does what it's supposed to and it'll continue to do what it's supposed to. It's the money of the future of our science fiction novels.

There's no Krypto Kris marketing shitty debit cards. There's no charismatic Do Kwon doing a Forbes, Steve Jobs photo shoot with a black t-shirt and a white background. There's no J Powell magically expanding the money supply with a cobol fueled wand, creating a 9 trillion USD balance sheet out of thin air.

If they fuck up, you also trust the government to step in and force them to behave and protect your assets (if a bank defaults on its debts and can't give you your money back, your deposits are FDIC ensured and so the government pays you back).

Hacker steals money from my wallets. Sends it to their own wallet. Then maybe from there to another wallet, and so on. It doesn't seem any more difficult to track it for more steps. 

Can't authorities say ""wallet 12345...."" received all the money from the hack in the news. So any exchange that accepts money from that wallet is supporting terrorism"" or whatever they need to say to justify shutting it down?

Succinctly, I keep hearing stories about stolen crypto, but I don't know enough to appreciate how tha makese sense or is even possible, given how it's all tracked. I feel like it's literally like stealing a bright yellow ferrari and driving in circles in small town. 

Can somepoint share some insight into how it's possible to steal something that exists electronically and is publicly logged?

I did some searching and found [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/6o41vu/found_bitcoin_wallet_keys_in_my_phone_from_2013/) where someone had a similar experience. I followed the advice in the thread, re-downloaded the Bitcoin Wallet app by Andreas Schildbach, and tried to import it, but (of course) it's password protected.

I'm not a security professional; however, I have played around a little on Kali Linux before, so I am aware that I can try to bruteforce it with Hashcat, as I do remember most of the password (my 2013 password security wasn't fantastic...).

However, not being a security professional, I'm feeling a little lost as to how to properly format the command to run this. I created a wordlist with the part of the password I do remember (and variations of it). I also downloaded another much larger wordlist.

I'm not really sure of where to go from here or how to format this/run it properly to get it to work. I don't know how it's encrypted, so I don't know which [mode](https://hashcat.net/wiki/doku.php?id=example_hashes) to use in the command, for example. And I'm sure I'm missing a lot of other things.

My idea is to send to the exchange the BTC I've bought on P2P websites that are separated into different UTXOs and immediately withdraw them to my wallet, so all my UTXOs can be unified without revealing on the blockchain that I was the same owner of them. Kinda like a ""legal mixing"" of bitcoin, but without drawing attention of blockchain analysis' companies.

My only fear is that they might block the BTC I send to them and only allow me to withdraw if I do id verification, which kills the whole point of doing this.

Hello, I have been asked to make a payment in crypto and, I'm not sure what my steps should be from here.

I've done a bit of research on different wallets and, since there are pros and cons everywhere, and I'm a bit of an overthinker, I figured I'd come and ask you guys for your advice for setting myself up to be able to make payments, while hopefully learning more about crypto along the way.

I  do not currently have an interest in devoting time or money to investing/trading. I just need to make direct transactions in specific amounts. This may change the more I learn about it all, I just don't have the time at the moment.

I'm looking forward to your expertise and instruction. As mentioned all over this subreddit, I will not be answering DM's regarding this. I'll only be responding to comments. I also would like clear and concise instructions so that I can safely set everything up myself.

    The second mem pool attack [5] states that spam transactions are created by Sybil accounts with a relay fee above the minimum relay fee required for a transaction, however, the transactions mining fee is below the minimum fee to be included directly in a block, this way transactions go to mem pool and stay there. Also, mem pool size grows, and for a real user to create a transaction and have it included in a block it is needed to include a relevant price for the transaction fee. After the same procedures, it was discovered that it increases Bitcoin transaction fee price by time and keeps other transactions away from been included in a block. 

I have the following questions:

1. What are Sybil accounts in Bitcoin?
2. What is the relay fees?

    Relay fee"" refers to the minimum fee amount that other clients on the peer-to-peer network require in order to forward transactions to other peers. This fee is in place in order to prevent the broadcast and propogation of DDoS-like spam transactions. 

Sorry, I can’t understand how a relay fee can prevent a DDoS attack.

3) Why does Bitcoin’s transaction fee increase over time and keep other transactions away from been included in a block?

Is transaction fee = relay fee + mining fee?

I can’t understand this. Its says that mem pool size grows. Real users can store the transaction in the block, it does not say that block is not accepting transactions.

4) What is the problem with an increase in mempool size?

Somebody, please guide me.

Zulfi.

How would they check if that seed phrase actually has any bitcoin on there? They would have to restore every individual seed phrase to find this information, right? Or would there be a quicker way to do so? Because, if there is a quick way to check, what is preventing people from creating specific software and hardware for checking as many seed phrases as they can?

The people who actually understand crypto are truly the backbone of the market and the driving force behind all the innovation we are seeing. For anyone and everyone who understands crypto and helps others understand it, I thank you all from the bottom of my heart!**

If you don't mind answering, I have a little doubt. I was watching 3Blue1Brown 's video about how Bitcoin works ([here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBC-nXj3Ng4)) and he said that transaction fees is slowly becoming the major income source for miners as block reward diminishes, and that transaction fee is to incentivize the miner who added your trans. to the block. **My question is**: what if, in the future, miners choose to include only those transactions in their blocks which include transaction fees?

Would we always have to pay a little more each transaction so as to please the miner and make him include your transaction to the block?

Who is to stop the miners from doing that? Having to always pay more than you wanted to would be very bad for the users and that might just erase people's trust in the crypto market.

Like my dad has actually stopped using credit cards because they always charge 1% service charge per transaction, and so he had to pay more than he wanted to and now he directly pays people in their bank accounts. This way, they (the credit card company) lost a customer.

Will the same happen to crypto market if the scenario I described above happens?

Let me just start out by saying that I know very little about bitcoin and the blockchain so this is either a really big deal or a non issue and I have no idea ...

Basically I was buying bitcoin on exodus which stopped doing business in my state, so I decided to use a bitcoin ATM for my next transaction. I bought some in cash and then transferred the tiny amount of money I had in my exodus wallet to my new coinme wallet. This transaction never showed up in my new wallet. 

I was watching the whole thing go down on blockchain dot com and noticed that my transaction went straight from confirmed to sent.

I thought this was weird and hit up customer support but I'm learning that coinme kinda sucks and they never got back to me. 

I decided to look up my exodus address on the network and it said that the money arrived in my coinme wallet but was almost instantly sent to a different address. This is so fucking weird IMO. It's such a tiny amount of money that I'm not too pissed off but I'm just confused. Is this normal at all?? Part of me wants to believe that this is like an extra confirmation or some blockchain thing I never learned about, but what I imagine actually happened is that coinme is not that secure and my BTC somehow got scooped up.

BTW, the address that my money ended up getting sent to has a ton of transactions and has received a lot of BTC from a ton of different addresses. This all kinda sucks bc I thought the blockchain was supposed to be more secure than this.

I had access to the wallet which was installed there and there are fucking shit more than 2 Bitcoins on it I'm going crazy. I don't want to write the exact number publicly but yes it would help my life a hell of a lot right now because the situation I think like some people has just gotten worse somehow.

just spend it and live with it or should I report it to the store because they may know the repairer? I think they would keep it for themselves if I report it to the store. 

I think if someone bought the phone and it is missing and he sees that and he still has the receipt with the serial code of the phone that would be the evidence of 100% owner.

But just a small part of me thinks the opposite and that makes me really ... I can not describe it just very un-relaxed ...

Wish everyone a happy life... it would be very great if I would actually get help through the Internet. I also wana ask what is the best possible way to cash out this coins?",1,bitcoinbeginners,2022-09-03 11:45:07

I'll use a old android phone, Samsung S4 as cold wallet. This is my plan:

* Factory reset the phone
* install Lineage OS to get security up
* do initial setup, do not connect to WIFI
* remove permissions on as much apps as possible
* enable a strong password
* encrypt the phone

At this point, the phone should be secure enough to start

* download APK (check footprint) of a (wallet app) 
* generate a wallet (private key/public key) only choose a wallet which gives you a 12/24 words recovery phrase
* If you need internet for whatever, do your stuff and disconnect the phone from internet as soon as possible. 
* For storage, remove the battery from the phone.

So why did I decide to try this?

In the near future most burglars will know about ledger or trezor, but will leave your old broken phone be. You'll be the only one that knows what is on it. And you're able to have multiple coins because you can install multiple wallet-apps. So there's no need to go out there and buy a Ledger of Trezor, just do not throw away your old phone.

This non-custodial app can be used to trade fiat for BTC. As a mobile app, it allows the user to continue without signing up, logging in or selecting a username.

When asked to either create a key or import a key, I opted for a new one. Although it means having to store a new key, I personally feel an extra sense of security with a freshly generated key. Another layer made available is the ability to encrypt your key, preventing any unauthorised users from accessing your wallet.

I can also appreciate the app highlighting the importance of owning our own keys and keeping them safe, this is especially important to stress for those new to the industry.

The UI is simple enough: buy, swap, sell and view your portfolio with the option to pair your Coinbase account (I haven’t used Coinbase yet).

Buying offers are provided by Wyre and Simplex, from what I understand they are both external companies who have partnered with Bitpay, the user is directed from the app to one of these platforms to complete an offer.

Upon selecting Simplex, the site asks for a few details. If you are uncomfortable with providing your card details, full name, address, email and phone number then your journey ends here my friend.

After confirming the trade amount, I was asked to upload identification documents for verification this could either be a passport, ID Card or drivers license (for a trade of 100USD). I think allowing the user to go through all those previous steps to finalise with KYC is a little misleading for those who are not comfortable with giving such information but if you don’t mind, it’s your bog standard KYC.

**TLDR: A non custodial app used to buy, sell and swap crypto with fiat, where users own their own keys. Bitpay provides a simple user journey with the ability to link to a Coinbase account. Before trade is complete, users should expect a last minute KYC prompt from the app’s external partners.**

xfoo6i,NYKNYb,11,https://redd.it/xfoo6i,None,Question for Coldcard XPUB export,"Hello everyone 

What's the procedure to export the XPUB to a wallet that you backup from a seed?

Obviously I don't have access to the first address my wallet has generated. Who does, seriously?

I just want to generate and export XPUB for something like Sparrow or Electrum to be able to view my UTXOs.

Exporting XPUB is an ""advanced feature"". Strikes me as the most basic thing you'd want to do though.

Then when I try to export it just shows me a QR code. Just put the damn thing on the SD card lol.

What do? How do I get my XPUB on my SD card?!

If so, there wouldn't be a need for anything else. I understand the private key is long and not easy to handle manually, so a wallet may make a lot of sense and is probably a lot more comfortable.

2. If I were to use a Electrum Wallet on Tails (Live Linux) without persistent storage, would I need to start a new ""wallet"" everytime I restart the system? Would there be any disadvantage other than the effort (and potentially not having a history)?

I can get to the second round using online hash tools. From what I gather reading online is that you need to hash the raw binary for the second round like you do in the first. Not the hexdecimal output of the first hash.

Hexdecimal converts to different values when converting to ascii while binary is the same values.

What i want to know, and what the online tools are not showing me, is what is the actual raw binary value  being hashed to get the second hash?

The equivalent of hashing hello to start.

I added $120 to the Atomic Wallet, and then spent about $93 on a different BTC purchase on Sellix. After all was said and done, I had roughly $11 left in my Atomic wallet after fees and whatnot. 

Later I checked the wallet again just to explore what you can do on it, and saw that my leftover $11 was gone. I found my order history and saw an extra transation.

I don't plan on leverage trading and stuff, just long-term investment stuff. 

1. Which on-ramp supports ACH transfers from credit unions? I opened my account in one of credit unions, get my salary on there, and I notice that in some apps that ask you to connect your bank account to it, they only have banks like M&T, Bank of America, etc, but not smaller credit unions. So, I need an on-ramp which will support an ACH from my credit union.

2. Out of these on-ramps, which one has fair fees (~0.5% or less) and a fairly healthy amount of alt-btc pairs? My idea is to go heavily into btc until the next bull run, and when the dominance reaches 60% or more, and start declining, convert btc to alt(s) of my choosing, and then back to btc or USDC when dominance falls to ~40%. Then cash out to my credit union account.

3. I know that holding an asset for more than 1 year triggers long-term capital gains, but what happens if I hold btc for 2 years, then convert it to an alt, and sell the alt to usdc after 3 months. Did I trigger long-term capital gains, short-term, or both?",1,bitcoinbeginners,2022-10-12 00:09:34

This device is designed to be extremely secure even down to its packaging. The ColdCard comes in a sealed plastic bag with a number on it, this number is also engraved permanently on the ColdCard board. Due to the transparent case, the number can be seen interiorly and should match the one displayed on the bag.

I have a Electrum wallet in my Windows PC with some fraction of bitcoins (satoshis).
I have the seed and the password of this wallet noted.
I want to format this PC and install Linux.

1 - newbie practical question

If I format the PC and reinstall the Electrum wallet in this new enviroment, is any chance that I may lose my bitcoins, or with the seed in hands everything is safe?

2 - newbie tecnical question

That(1) said, if it is possible, what ""holds"" the bitcoins in this meanwhile?
Are the bitcoins just ""cold"" in this meanwhile?
The thing that keeps the information of my wallet balance and historical is simply the seed of the wallet?
Is that possible that just the seed carry all the information needed that interacts with the blockchain?

3 - catastrofic cenario

If Electrum (company and wallet develop) dies or goes offline, is my bitcoins safe? In this catastrofical case, could I keep doing transactions with the wallet?
How?

My idea here is:

- Convert personal savings to BTC.
- Put them in a Ledger or other cold storage device.
- At any point in the future, if needed, or in an emergency, transfer them somewhere or somehow convert it back to fiat, USD in my case, so they're usable in a situation like that.

I haven't updated myself in btc practicaluses for a long time, and I know the lightning network improved a lot of things and fees, and many places actually take BTC for payment now. Unfortunately where I live is a bit, let's call it rustic, so no such thing exists for now.

I used 'send bitcoin' from cashapp on one phone, and displayed the qr code for the 'receiving' address on the other, and scanned it with cashapp. Cashapp said transaction complete and bitcoin balance adjusted. Now I had also selected the within 24 hours option with no fees.

My General Reason For Yes:

in the grand scheme of things, You're going to have a lot of tabs open like your bank accounts website(sometimes), one or more brokerage  platforms that may have unknown security leaks, wich some of those platforms may be linked to tradingview or other chart sites wich themselves might have security concerns, apology messages to your ex girlfriend you don't want getting out, notes on how to please a woma... sorry was reading off my chrome tabs... Either way? A lot of opportunity for things to go Apeshit cus a 12 year old bruted force a server admin password or some shit(It's happened a surprising amount of times in history.)

My General Reason For no:

If these brokerages have no little risk of cracking open and i'd rather just be a man about it and give my data to google then some off brand VPN company that's gonna send it to google anyway.

- Buying Skytrain/Metro ticket, payment with a QR code

- Even paying for highway tolls (M-Flow) with a QR code sent to your chat app (Line).

Imagine that a dev creates an Android app that makes it possible to pay all these QR codes with Bitcoin.

My question is, how can this dev make a profit?

Fiat QR code payments are with 0 fees. If the dev will ask for a fee for every payment, I believe only bitcoin diehards will pay the extra cost to use Bitcoin. In my opinion, paying more with bitcoin than fiat will not really motivate Bitcoin newbies to change to BTC.

Or am I wrong?

Or are there other options to make a profit?

I'm a European living in Thailand. For me, the perfect app would be, I'm paid in Euro, and I exchange my euro for BTC.

yc96oq,Ryan_Hoxling,7,https://redd.it/yc96oq,None,Samourai wallet - all remaining balance disappeared/spend on fees?," I'm kind of new to this, so hoping someone could assist me with this. My BTC balance became 0 after a transaction despite me not spending them all, and I don't know why.

For example:  
I had 0.04003364 BTC total in my wallet.  
My last transaction send amount was **0.0398** BTC.  
I set up **0.00001362** BTC as a fee.  
I should be left with **0.00022002** BTC in my wallet.  
However, that's not what happened, and my wallet balance was set to 0's

After checking my transaction on [blockchain.com](https://blockchain.com/), it seems like those **0.00022002** BTC were sent on a different wallet entirely, as in they are not part of the transaction fees or the requested send amount?

I have used samourai wallet for a long time now and never had an issue like that. But recently I had to create a new wallet, and both output transactions that I've made on this wallet resulted in some funds disappearing somewhere.

Granted, it's not that big amount, but I was planning on splitting the total amount into different outputs in the future, and I'm really afraid now that I could lose much more by doing so.

Could someone with more experience than me please check and tell me what exactly happened here?

3) the sender then sends the transaction bundled with their public key, and also sends their digital signature alongside it
4) the receiver gets the transaction and public key and they also hash it with SHA256 to get the same output as the sender got
5) the receiver then uses the public key sent with the transaction to decrypt the signature created by the senders private key
5) the sender compares the SHA256 hashed result from the transaction and public key with the decrypted result
6) if both results are the same, the receiver knows that the transaction is genuine without modification.

How does data storage come into picture .  Since The authenticty of a transaction can only be verified by adding it to the network of hashed blocks, does it not make storage a problem in the future. Do we have to keep a record of all transactions that ever happened till the end of time for bitcoin (or any other crypto) to be considered secure.

However, [Sparrow Wallet's own website](https://sparrowwallet.com/docs/best-practices.html) favors the use of an Electrum Personal Server over a server set up using Bitcoin Core. 

The reasoning for favoring Electrum Personal Server seems to be due to the fact that Bitcoin Core does not encrypt a file tracking one's BTC balance, thus putting the user's privacy at risk. However, I have not seen tutoriuals on how to set up an Electrum Personal Server and pair it with software such as Sparrow Wallet.

Is the fact that Bitcoin Core does not encrypt a file really such a big deal, given that it is only supposed to be paired with software that one trusts (Sparrow Wallet)?

1) I am currently sending the security deposit to the multisig escrow wallet so that I can buy some bitcoin from a user. I am in the middle of ""broadcasting"" my transaction to the network, and it is taking a while. How long does this usually take? What if someone else buys the bitcoin before my transaction broadcasts? What if the price of bitcoin quickly jumps up in price while my transaction is processing, and I need to send a larger security deposit? Its been broadcasting for about 10-15 minutes now...

2) All of my bitcoin thus far has been purchased via centralized exchanges. Once (if?) I manage to buy some bitcoin on bisq, how do I keep it anonymous / non-kyc'd? If I send it back to my hardware wallet, it will be linked to all of my other kyc'd bitcoin, correct? How do I avoid this? Do I need to get a new hardware wallet?

3) If I use my kyc'd bitcoin to fund the security deposit to bisq, is that a privacy / security risk from a kyc perspective? 

4) Is using zelle to buy bitcoin on bisq okay, or does that still put me at 3rd party / kyc risk?

ym2rkj,analogmatch,6,https://redd.it/ym2rkj,None,Understanding withdrawal/deposit fees for moving crypto assets to a hardware wallet.,"I'm planning to move my crypto assets to a hardware wallet. Currently, my crypto assets are held in a custodial account of the crypto exchange. Will they charge any fees to transfer the asset to a hardware wallet? Its not clear reading the fee schedule. For example, on [binance.us](https://binance.us) if you look at their [withdrawal/deposit fees schedule](https://www.binance.us/fee/schedule?type=deposit-withdrawal), they say min withdrawal for BTC is 0.0004 and the fee is 0.0002. So is this a flat fee of 0.0002 or is that a %age? If its a %age that would be a 50% fee which would be ridiculously high. At the same time if I were to withdraw say for example 10 BTC would the fee still be 0.0002 BTC. That is really low!!

I learned the basics of the bitcoin blockchain. The « blockchain 1.0 » as we call it. I know that a block can hold 2000-2700 transactions, average mining time in 2022, 10 minutes for a whole block, the one who solved the block gets rewarded with 6.25 BTC. Then, it created another block, until eventually we reach 21 millions block. But there’s one thing I don’t understand. If a block can hold up to 2000 ish transactions, and the number of blocks are finite, it should theoretically mean that at the end, no more transactions should be able to be stored. And that’s where my question comes in. It can’t just stop storing them. So, what happens to a block after it is mined? It can’t just be that another one is created. I guess a full block just compresses its information to fit more into them so the whole system is not completely useless at 21 million block? 

So yeah, basically, what happens to a block after being mined besides « creating another one » ?

ywlr5x,BlueberryDefender,11,https://redd.it/ywlr5x,None,What is the possibility of a hardware wallet rug pull?,"I understand that bitcoin security and privacy are not binary and is more on a spectrum. Also that the 'most ideal'  long term cold storage method is highly individual and depends on each person's situation or use case.  I've played around with multi-signature, and different hardware wallets (HWW),  but now primarily use a ColdCard with passphrase.

My question comes after reading something on twitter from JW Weatherman (creator of the 'Yeti Cold' guidelines for 3-of-7 multi-sig cold storage).  He often references Gregory Maxwell (a bitcoin OG, whom I'm not too familiar with) and how they both think hardware wallets are a terrible idea for long term cold storage. Although JW does think HWWs are fine for smaller amounts, he is very much biased towards a 3-of-7 multisig, set up with linux devices, using bitcoin core.  That's the basis of Yeti Cold. He recommends this I believe even to beginners who are technical enough.

What caught my attention was when he mentioned - in relation to the FTX fiasco - that a HWW rug pull would be much more catastrophic and is always a possibility with any HWW company.  From what I could gather, his concerns are with the supply chain (e.g. bitcoin HWWs draw attention and give incentive for people to manipulate), and with the software of the devices (e.g. written by small teams, and difficult to audit what code is really in your actual device).

Is this really a concern?  For the average non-super-technical individual, is going through multi-sig and bitcoin core, through linux devices, really the ideal way for secure, long term storage? Does the answer hinge upon the likelihood of a HWW rug pull?",6,bitcoinbeginners,2022-11-16 06:15:24

""well, what if this cycle is different and things do not work like we expect because of recession, Inflation, crisis... what if btc goes into like a hibernation process and it stays around but does not create enough signal to bring more use and customers, what if the current crisis really fucks the world econoimic system without people really understanding it..

Here is what I did:

I couldn't recover Samourai wallet in any other wallet. Tried electrum, tried blue wallet, tried Relai. Finally installed Samourai in a different phone and I still could not recover it.

I am either stupid, or Samourai wallet seed does not work, so what I did was:

- created a new wallet in Relai (where I will be buying sats)
- used the 12 seeds in Blue Wallet to recover it. It seemed it worked, but I had no sats there to confirm.
- went to Samourai wallet and sent a small amount of sats to Relai wallet.
- Blue Wallet saw it first and then Relai 
- so now I was sure I had the 12 words right, since both wallets were showing it.
- I then sent the remainder of my balance, and they are both showing it as well 

From my small experiment, I do not trust Samourai wallet.

Original post:



Newbie here, based in Europe.

I have a couple of sats in a Samourai Wallet, and just learned of Relai service (Swiss based exchange, no KYC, and non custodial wallet).

So I decided I am going to keep on stacking those sats again using Relai, and tried to recover my Samourai Wallet into Relai, with no success.

I have two concerns:

- first and most important: how do I know that my Samourai seed phrase actually recovers my wallet? Should I install a different wallet in a different phone and try the recovery process? I would hate to find myself in a situation where I loose my phone and need to recover my wallet, and find out my seed phrase does not work.

- second, my seed phrase in Samourai also has a passphrase, but Relai wallet does not ask for passphrase. Is this the reason I cannot recover it?

What happens if someone hides malicious code in an otherwise useful update and that the few people who understand approve ? I understand that nodes can just go back to a previous version but coordinating such a move could prove difficult if the malicious code was introduced a few updates ago",0,bitcoinbeginners,2022-11-19 11:02:23

I assume if I send crypto to the account of the seed phrase that I forgot, I will lose those funds if I lose the ledger?

However, Electrum showed me a fee that was about 4x higher on the transaction.
It was a relatively small amount (~$160 worth) and about 8% of it was lost in the process.
Is that reasonable? Are fees more so per transaction rather than a % of the overall amount? If I were to make a bigger withdraw of everything I own (still not that much unfortunately) I should (hopefully) expect a much lower fee as a percent, is that correct or am I doing something very wrong?

z2a6it,SigsySigs,12,https://redd.it/z2a6it,None,Can Bitcoin fail or face a lot of difficulty if mining difficulty gets too high and miners get priced out due to unprofitability (or some other cause)?,"Hi all - I just posted this over on r/Bitcoin, but hopefully can get some insight from here too.

Apologies for the long post, but I'm just doing some thought experiments and this was one of them. I don't have enough knowledge about the mining side of BTC to go through with this, but my question is pretty much the title and I'd like to see what others think and hopefully some reasonings on why this isn't an issue.

Below are some assumptions behind the reasoning of this thought. I understand the chances are incredibly low for all of these things happening, but I'm still curious to know and I think it would be a good discussion. I'm also aware of the difficulty adjustment, per point 4, but bear with me. So, I'm assuming:

1. BTC price stays low/suppressed
2. Miners get priced out due to unprofitability
3. A lot (and I mean a lot) of miners stop mining within a short time horizon to prevent further losses (i.e. multiple large mining pools stop mining)
4. So much so that there are far too many blocks until the next difficulty adjustment
5. Now there are a fraction of the miners left on the network tasked with solving blocks, but the hash rate has been reduced heavily, resulting in a disproportioned difficulty level to hash rate
6. Blocks are then solved incredibly slowly and require a heavy amount of energy input and cost to solve, still resulting in a potential loss (even if we assume miners would receive a higher subsidy)
   1. Said another way, I'm assuming that although less miners would be entitled to more of the block rewards (aka would make it more profitable for them), this increase in rewards is offset by the large increase in cost to solve the block, removing any additional profitability and keeping them in a loss position

This then leads me to a few question:

1. What the title is asking
2. Is the mining difficulty adjustment calculation weighted more towards the near term and would it help solve this issue (after slowly solving the remaining blocks well above the desired average 10 minute blocktime)?
   1. I'd appreciate any good resources on learning about the difficulty adjustment
3. Can something like this be mitigated?
4. Is it crucially important for the average block to be solved every 10 minutes? What happens if became one block per hour or worse than that?
   1. I would think this is important as it helps preserve the security of the network and to keep the costs to attack the network high via double spending or making a longer manipulated chain

That's the extent of my thoughts and questions. I'm no expert (probably clear to some of you haha), but wanted to ask anyway. Thanks!",14,bitcoinbeginners,2022-11-23 00:28:38

z4asp7,Acopone,9,https://redd.it/z4asp7,None,"Please explain: Assuming the world moves onto a bitcoin standard, how will we encourage growth?","Hi,So I really want to invest in Bitcoin, it makes alot of sense in many many ways, apart from one. And I'm hoping someone can clarify this to me.

Bitcoin has a hard limit of 21million coins, and Jeff Booth explains that this 'new' system will be deflationary in nature. And will therefore continiously lead to lower and lower prices. Prices might still be set in fiat currency so we have price stability, but in bitcoin denominated terms they'll become cheaper over time. (This is supposedly a good thing, and this is where I get stuck.)

If a company wants to start a business, takes out a loan of 100 bitcoin to start thier business. And they are selling milk... but the price of milk continues to decline over time, how does that not break the business? Well maybe the business will instead take out the loan in fiat currency, and therefore a continious strengthing bitcoin will not matter as both the price of goods sold as well as the loan will deflate over time, relative to bitcoin. That's fine and that makes sense.

But then if you have bitcoin, what incentive do people have to invest in a company? Why not just hold onto your bitcoins. If you sell your bitcoin for office space, furniture, equipment etc, you're having to do a lot of effort to retain your 'buying' power. Where as if you just sit on your coins, you have double effectiveness.1.)  You remove coins from circuation, reducing the velocity of money, causing further deflation.2.)  Bitcoin value relative to fiat just continues to increase and therefore you benefit by saving and holding indefinitly.

What I see happening in this bitcoin standard is that free cashflows from businesses will be used to buy bitcoin, those coins will never be spent, causing further deflation due to less liquidity in the market. And therefore everyone will want to hold onto their bitcoin, because it'll be worth more tomorrow than today. It'll lead to zero/no investment, zero R&D, and unemployment. People will only spend the bare minimum as saving is encouraged. And those that save early will become more and more wealthy over time. And it'll get to a point like today, where the wealth is concentrated in the hands of a select few, who will be able to manipulate the system like they do today, and therefore bitcoin changes nothing. It's simply a reset, but now it's a reset where governments have zero control over the supply of money, and you'll end up with democracies that are weak, and instead we resort back to the times of kings and queens.

Like where am I going wrong? Please someone explain like i'm 5yo?I don't see this working in the long run?

I have four receipts from two different bitcoin atm's and need step by step instructions to convert these back into cash. Assume I know nothing or next to nothing.

Too long part:

My 91 year old mother got conned into emptying her savings and putting it all into bitcoin. She's fully with it so I'm surprised she fell for the con, but she did. They had her put it all in bitcoin atm's, and she even says that as soon as she did it she thought she had just lost all her money. She says she didn't give the scammers the pin number that she entered into the atm and I assume because of that and that they continued to call her that they didn't get the money and it is still available.

After a bit of research I downloaded the cash app onto her phone, but I can't see the bit coin icon, nor do I know what to do to sell the bitcoins and get some, most, or all of her money back.

The instructions I have been able to find so far assume the reader has a basic knowledge of bitcoin transactions, an affliction which I don't have. I know there is a simple process but I'll be damned if I can figure it out.

If anyone can give me really, really basic instructions or point me in the right direction I would be forever grateful. Mom doesn't have that much and I'd sure like to get this back for her.

So I first had the issue when I set up the 5 deposits it just locked out my account, Strike was super quick to get back to me and said it was just a flute thing since I set up 5 deposits. Two weeks go by and I get paid and when the deposits hit Strike it locks out my account again, support quickly gets back to me and this time they said since I had 5 deposits set up it was flagging my account and recommended i condense it to 1 biweekly deposit. So I did as they recommended and condensed it to 1 deposit for the total sum I wanted in. My most recent check it flagged the deposit again and it was just sent up as 1 deposit like they recommended.

Bittrex only deals with Legacy (P2PKH) and Nested Segwit (P2SH). I want to send some BTC to a Native Segwit (bech32) address. Unfortunately, this isn't supported by Bittrex (recent, see below). 

I installed Electrum, which will send to Native Segwit address.... but I was mistaken to think this would work because Electrum (version 4.3.2, late Nov 2022) only works with Native Segwit, hence I can't move my BTC from Bittrex. Sadly, google pulled up responses pre-2022, at a time when Electrum would allow you to build a new **legacy** wallet from the GUI. This is no longer the case. Note: it might still launch in legacy mode via a flag on the Linux terminal, but I am asking on behalf of someone with no BTC or Linux experience. They need the GUI.

So, what Wallet can be installed on Windows, and it will (a) generate either a P2PKH or P2SH address so I can retrieve my BTC from Bittrex, and (b) will then send BTC to a Native Segwith (bech32) address.

zkc3tv,rcashneon,20,https://redd.it/zkc3tv,None,Educate Me - Bitcoin Mining,"Hello :)

I'm just beginning to educate myself on cryptocurrencies, blockchain tech, bitcoin, etc. and have a very rudimentary understanding of everything. Mining is one concept I just can't seem to wrap my head around, no matter how many different articles I read at all different levels of explanation/understanding.

Hopefully someone can clarify and answer these questions in a way that finally makes sense to my brain :)

As I understand it, in extremely rudimentary terms, ""mining"" is the process of verifying transactions on blockchain by solving a complex mathematical puzzle (nonce value). The first ""miner"" to solve the puzzle (target hash) adds the transaction to the blockchain, and (once a majority of other miners verify their answer) receives a set amount of btc.

What I don't understand, is where the ""answer"" to said mathematical puzzle comes from, how it is found by a miner, and how other miners can verify that answer, without first knowing the answer themselves. What determines the ""target hash,"" and what confirms an answer to be ""correct,"" (or at or below the target hash)? Furthermore, how does answering that puzzle confirm a transaction to be legitimate?

Finally, if bitcoin mining is the process of verifying transactions, how did Satoshi Nakamoto mine the genesis block? Obviously, without yet having any created bitcoin, there would have been no transactions to verify.

I'm thinking I may just have a fundamental misunderstanding somewhere along the process, and none of this will make sense to me until I find and correct my misconception.

Can anyone break this down in another way that might finally make sense to me?

Edit: BONUS QUESTION - 

I've read some bitcoin skeptics who suggest that the blockchain will become insecure once all btc has been mined, as miners will have little incentive to continue mining once they are only receiving transaction costs as a reward. 

What is the counter-argument to this? Is this a scenario Satoshi Nakamoto considered?

zkcw0r,rcashneon,19,https://redd.it/zkcw0r,None,Educate Me - Could BTC theoretically run out?,"Hello :)

I understand that BTC has a hard limit of 21 million Bitcoin, and there's roughly 18m BTC's that have been released so far. I also understand Satoshi Nakamoto owns at least 1 million BTC that is assumed to be gone forever, and there are many other wallets with massive amounts of btc that have seen no movement whatsoever in 5+ years, leading to the possibility that those coins have been lost forever as well.

I understand that BTC can be ""burned"" by being sent to an address with no known private keys, and without access to private keys, any btc will be lost forever. I've read stories of people who have thrown away hard drives with btc, sent them to a wrong address by mistake, sent them to nakamoto's wallet as a tribute, etc. I even read one article that suggests 20% of btc has already been lost forever.

This leaves me with a very hypothetical question, what if all btc is burned (or lost)? After all 21m btc has been released, the number can only go down, right? I understand it would take an extreeeemeeely long time, but could humans run out of btc after enough burning? What will continued btc burning do to the economy over time?

-I can do it myself via bitadress.org

The only way I can think of is a real life p2p interaction but that doesn’t feel safe and I’d have no idea how to even find someone willing to do that. Is it even possible to buy bitcoin totally anonymously?",1,bitcoinbeginners,2022-12-13 21:04:50

According to the video shown at the top of [https://bitcoin.org/en/full-node#what-is-a-full-node](https://bitcoin.org/en/full-node#what-is-a-full-node), you have to first make sure the SHA256SUM of the downloaded file matches at least one of the list above. But the list above originally contains a bunch of PGP sigs instead of SHA256SUMS associated to each available OS version of the download file.

&#x200B;

Am I doing anything wrong? Or are the keys corrupt? One thing is certain, the PGP key from Laan's is no longer valid and there's not a new one provided.

Let's say an exchange allows you to transfer only 0,1 BTC daily. 

Is it better (fee-wise) to:

a) transfer those funds to the same address X times, 

or 

b) transfer each day to a different and NEWLY created address (no previous history)? 

I'm asking because I read that later on, the fees would be lower if you're sending from X different addresses (same wallet), which have just the history of 1 transaction vs sending from a one address which has the history of the X transactions. 

Apparently it's less space consuming (?) to check the history in the a) case than the b) case, hence less fees to be applied.",9,bitcoinbeginners,2022-12-16 22:14:43

2. How is a transaction verified? I imagine we can take the transaction hash and ask many nodes to see if their local chain contains my transaction, but what if they lie?

3. If bitcoin nodes are decentralized, how do we get the overview of the current consensus, the current common ledger? Do we just ask enough nodes and hope most of them are honest?

So what exchange do you trust the most for the future not to go under? It seems like FTX and other companiess were able to get away with so much because they’re not public companies which are regulated and have strict financial reporting obligations.

I understand that most self custody wallets generate that seed phrase for you and ask you to write it down.

\- If they know what your private key is and they generate your seed phrase from that private key.  Then what's stopping them from storing and recording what your seed phrase is?

Then what is preventing the app developers from knowing what your bitcoin private key is and stealing your coin?
