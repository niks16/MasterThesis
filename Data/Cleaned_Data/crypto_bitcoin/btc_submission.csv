Can someone help by making a post about it on [r/CryptoCurrency](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/) ? I don't have enough karma to do it myself.

Al this game needs is a bit of love :)

It is p2p game , no central server,  website just gives you some basic info and a file to download. Ingame currency is BCH, it has built in market for a fish that players catch. Fishermen and pirates fight for supremacy. Resource mines and ships movements are synced with regards to BCH blockchain, each new block moves ships to a next point along the route, and adds an amount of metal from the mine to the inventory. 

Players can earn BCH by selling rare fish to each other. Fish is needed to advance.",0,btc,2022-01-01 00:08:55

I created another ""entry point"" for gaze named [glimpse.cash](https://glimpse.cash/)

any videos uploaded on glimpse.cash will be available on gaze.cash and any safe videos uploaded from safe channels on gaze.cash will likewise be available on glimpse.cash

ruv5cs,yokesh351,3,https://redd.it/ruv5cs,None,Eight events that will move bitcoin and cryptocurrencies in 2022,"Regulation, consolidation, and further adoption expected

The analysis houses refine their predictions for the financial markets for next year, including forecasts for the [development of the cryptocurrency](https://www.blockchainx.tech/crypto-currency-development) market. If the 'crypto' industry has shown anything in 2021, it is that the movements in its valuation are difficult to predict, but so far it has had a bullish response to the positive steps of the traditional industry. ""After a period of destruction of the last barriers, 2022 should be a year of regulation, consolidation, and greater adoption, "" Bitpanda analysts say.

However, the experts consulted avoid offering predictions about the prices they will conquer, beyond drawing a wide range for bitcoin between 40,000 and 70,000 dollars, according to 'Bloomberg'. With immediate support at $ 45,500 and $ 47,000 and resistance at $ 50,000, $ 55,000 and $ 60,000. ""Rolling the dice or rolling a roulette wheel is probably just as good a tool as another for forecasting the future of prices,"" says the experts at AJ Bell, however eight key factors that will influence prices can be isolated.

1. More adoption by companies and countries

""As the digital asset market grows, we expect more companies to embrace bitcoin as a balance sheet asset and a potential revenue generator from mining operations,"" say Van Eck experts, who foresee further maturation in this sense. They also hope that other emerging market countries will follow in El Salvador's footsteps, as they may find bitcoin useful as a monetary tool, and a potential option to avoid some of the negative side effects of relying solely on the International Monetary Fund and the Bank. World to receive aid with debt.

Of course, AJ Bell they influence that ""cryptocurrencies are used in a significant way as a means of exchange between companies and consumers, not only as a marketing tool.""

2. More investment products

Also, new investment products, such as more exchange traded funds, could open avenues to make the [development of cryptocurrencies](https://www.blockchainx.tech/crypto-currency-development) more liquid and help establish them as a new asset class for investment managers, which would be a positive step for this industry. In both cases, ""the volatility of 'cryptos' is a major sticking point that makes it difficult to see big breakthroughs taking place when companies have bills to pay in dollars, euros, and pounds, and likewise, large funds need to inform their investors in traditional currencies "", they comment from AJ Bell.

3. More stock market debuts

In 2022, even more, cryptocurrency companies will go public, which are preparing to go public, and in 2022 the trend set by new companies listed in 2021 will continue. There is a wide range of businesses in which crypto companies can participate. , from exchanges to digital asset miners and payment companies. ""As the cryptocurrency market continues to grow and develop, we anticipate that the market will grow with new quotes, and it will also change as companies gain and lose market share,"" they say from Van Eck.

4. More regulation

Regulatory activity is likely to be negative for these assets. ""Regulators do not like the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãa financial system that can be used to launder money, defraud consumers and that, ultimately, could cause large losses among investors,"" they point out from AJ Bell. Tightening measures in India and China could be replicated elsewhere, with regulators and governments generally going to set their sights on cryptocurrencies as they become more integrated into the traditional financial ecosystem.

5. Central bank digital currencies

Central banks, including in the UK, are also looking into the possibility of launching their own digital currencies, which would be negative for cryptocurrencies, as these could usurp some of the perceived benefits of bitcoin and others, such as the speed of payments and transaction costs, especially across borders. Experts foresee that during 2022 the investigations of the monetary supervisors in this regard will continue to be deployed.

6. More steps to limit the environmental impact of cryptocurrencies

The environmental piece of the puzzle could swing in either direction, with Tesla CEO Elon Musk being the somewhat unpredictable barometer on this particular issue, AJ Bell says. Unfortunately, ""the cryptocurrency industry continues to suffer the consequences of misinformed and misguided concerns, in particular those related to the use of energy required to mine bitcoin."" As the debate continues, we believe that cryptocurrency miners will continue to lead the way. the way in terms of green energy adoption and financial inclusion "", they add from Van Eck.

7. More uses for NFTs

The NFTs (non-fungible tokens) had a very successful year in 2021, but we believe that the best is yet to come, they assure from Van Eck. NFTs hit mainstream culture with millions of users, and the next major use cases to emerge will be sports ticket sales, loyalty points, and esports.

8. More ethereum and its protocol change

In the early stages of 2022, the Ethereum network's efforts to switch from the current proof-of-work model to the more sustainable proof-of-stake model will culminate. Experts consulted explain that this will drastically alter the landscape for Ethereum-focused miners. Rather than wasting energy solving high computational load problems, the new protocol will provide greater energy efficiency, increased network capacity, lower barriers to entry, and greater immunity to centralization for the [Ethereum blockchain development](https://www.blockchainx.tech/erc20-token-development). One of the main downsides of the upgrade is that mining this network will become unprofitable, which means that miners focused on this model will have to switch to greener pastures.",0,btc,2022-01-03 06:32:22

Thirteen years ago today, Satoshi Nakamoto launched the Bitcoin network. A few weeks after presenting his white paper to the world, Satoshi Nakamoto made his revolutionary idea a reality. On this day, I think it is essential to wish Bitcoin a happy birthday!

This birthday is also the birthday of all Bitcoiners, and more generally of all those who want to live their lives on their own terms.

This day is also the day of the Proof of Keys. This event takes place every year on January 3rd. It is a special time when all Bitcoiners are called upon to simultaneously withdraw their Bitcoin from the centralized exchange platforms to take possession of their Bitcoin's private keys.

In the latest issue of the In Bitcoin We Trust Newsletter, I also explain why in this year 13 after the creation of Bitcoin, everything will be different: [**https://inbitcoinwetrust.substack.com/p/we-are-year-13-after-bitcoin-network**](https://inbitcoinwetrust.substack.com/p/we-are-year-13-after-bitcoin-network)

A world in which we can once again have access to leaderless hard money that protects us from any kind of censorship.

With a LC, the buyer and manufacturer agree on performance and payment terms, the buyer then deposits funds to the bank who issues the letter of credit. Then the bank releases funds to seller only after receipt of documented milestones such as 10% on drawings, 70% on certified shipping documents, 10% on installation certificate signed by end user, and 10% on acceptance certificate signed by end user. The LC is always in a single currency (USD, INR, RMB, etc), but the issuing bank or associated advising banks typically provide subsequent exchange to local currency.

Not sure if this is an appropriate use for Smart Contracts (via smartBCH?), I am just learning and need advice. Would be great to cut out the banks, cut out the red tape, and eliminate all the banking fees!",11,btc,2022-01-04 05:20:33

rwg5f4,yokesh351,2,https://redd.it/rwg5f4,None,Bitcoin vs. Ethereum: Which Cryptocurrency Will Remain King of the Decentralized World?,"Bitcoin defends a new economic system. Ethereum wants to improve it. We present you the arguments that can make you change your mind regarding these cryptocurrencies.

The biggest reason that has allowed cryptocurrencies to exist in conjunction with traditional finance is the growing number of users worldwide who were presented with savings alternatives, payment platforms or investment instruments that were not previously available, be it due to lack of availability in your region or because you do not even have access to bank accounts to manage daily expenses. For this, the participation of the state has generated policies for the application of taxes, identification of users, prevention for money laundering, among others; This has paved the way for large-scale adoption to present itself as an achievable goal on the road ahead of digital assets.

It cannot be doubted that bitcoin continues to be the largest and best-known cryptocurrency worldwide, the market capitalization that places it at more than USD 878 billion is capable of doubling in approximation to its second contender, however, the Opportunities presented through the exchange of Non-Fungible Tokens (NFT) in conjunction with Decentralized Finance (DeFI), appears to be reversing the investment appeal of conventional fund managers. And it is that as we explained in the article why the growth of [DeFi development](https://www.blockchainx.tech/decentralized-finance-defi-development) points to being 100 times greater than what is currently known, the combination of venture capital companies with which large technology companies are the ones that allow for more resources to develop these products and find space to grow. 

One of the main problems that Bitcoin faces with respect to its inclusion in the traditional equity market, is that it is designed to supplant the old conceptions that are had with fiat money, which would mean taking the entire economic system that we currently know, towards a disruptive destiny that society has not yet validated as necessary. Regarding this issue, the co-founder of one of the first and largest debate communities about bitcoin in Venezuela tells us the following:

‚ÄúThe purpose of bitcoin is to decentralize the exchange of value, addressing the trust risk associated with fiat money transactions. Despite having these characteristics, it does not seek to be able to offer a profile to traditional investors to break into that market. That is why Michael Saylor with MicroStrategy has been successful, it allows for a bridge between the traditional and the disruptive, in order to bring bitcoin closer to the conventional. Although bitcoin is based on the premise of a real asset, it does not move in the same way as usual financial instruments. ""  Javier Bastardo, administrator at Satoshi in Venezuela .

Although 2021 has been the year in which public companies showed the greatest interest in participating in the asset , it was not made with a commitment that at least understood the importance of managing private keys. This allows us to understand that the participation of investment funds was not conditioned by the meaning of the value proposition, but rather by the search for the yield offered in pursuit of new historical highs.

Regarding the knowledge that both conventional users and mutual fund managers should have, Bastardo did not assert the following: 

""That still means that Bitcoin is an asset for everyone, both for the expert user who manages his own private keys, as well as for the one who only has a password to enter a centralized platform.""

Going to the basic understanding of the differences between Bitcoin and Ethereum, the aim of the latter is not to become the standard of use for the world's monetary reserves, instead, to offer developers access to code that can be validated by the conditions that are proposed for its use.This would mean, programmable agreements that present conditions that cannot be altered, and that in addition, their purpose of use is valid through the implementation of tokens generated in the network. This idea is what has allowed us to have access to decentralized platforms, where the acquisition of assets is not determined by a central entity, but rather by the agreements between parties that are reached by users such as the Axie Marketplace, Bored Apes or applications specialized in the loan of cryptocurrencies. 

It is then that for common users, the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãpracticality of this type of protocols is actively digestible, since they are presented as well-known arguments such as that of consumer banking that includes the application of loans and credits, achieving that the clients of these services can make use of them without the restrictive limitations of credit history, identity or even that said product is available in a certain region. The latter has been possible thanks to the adoption that stable cryptocurrencies have had, making way for all the currencies of the world to find refuge in the decentralized ecosystem, aspiring to become the banks of the future .

One of the most significant problems, which keeps large investors from participating in Bitcoin beyond the acquisition of ETFs in the stock market, could be found in the variation of volatility that the price of the asset generates on a daily basis. Although all cryptocurrencies with an exchange rate that is not linked to any tangible asset, suffer from these abrupt changes in price, when a cryptocurrency has a utilitarian purpose in a service that is presented as necessary, that exposure to volatility is reduced. This is the reason why we presented that while the price of bitcoin was struggling to overcome the barrier of $ 50,000, several DeFi products were yielding above 10% in the same time frame.

Another sample that allows us to visualize where the interest of entrepreneurs linked to Wall Street is, can be found in the investment that venture capital has placed as a growth bet, with an investment of USD 30 billion for entrepreneurs based in decentralized technology. And this is because bitcoin does not offer forks that change its original concept, the development product we have today does not derive from the initial value proposition that users want to maintain in the long term. Despite this, this condition should not be taken as a negative implication, since there is a revolutionary loyalty association for the creation of a new economic system.

Now, the proposals based on [Ethereum development](https://www.blockchainx.tech/erc20-token-development) and concepts such as Web 3.0, can be used by any entrepreneur with knowledge of software development, devising within the chain, proposals that have not even been thought by the creator of the Vit√°lik Buterin protocol, such as We could appreciate from the comment that the creation of NFTs is something that was never foreseen within the ecosystem. It is then, that it can be thought that the greatest attraction that will be generated with all the cryptocurrencies linked to the development of smart contracts such as Solana, Avalanche or Fantom (to take into account that although [Ethereum development](https://www.blockchainx.tech/erc20-token-development) is not currently the most economical protocol in terms of transaction fees, it is the one with the highest capitalization in the market) is the availability of offering financial services focused directly on the consumer who needs them, thus attracting more users who did not see interest in cryptocurrencies, to participate in the sector.It seems that seeing the king of cryptocurrencies dethroned is something that will not happen shortly, however, if the usefulness of this type of decentralized applications becomes more common to implement than the mechanisms offered by traditional finance, it is It is only a matter of time for the market to pivot towards where the greatest amount of money is available, and for that to attract the greatest number of users. 

If bitcoin is presented as digital gold, despite the fact that everyone knows its scarce value and that it is a means of exchange that offers value. How many people actually have these types of assets in their position? On the other hand, if what aims to replace smart contract cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum are the products offered by traditional banking, even going to people who need but have never accessed this type of service, how many people have a bank account? This question is the one that could argue who could get the throne of the king of the decentralized world.",0,btc,2022-01-05 06:24:12

rwib43,wtfCraigwtf,25,https://redd.it/rwib43,None,Opinion: Bukele is marching El Salvador into a BUZZSAW,"I'm reading up on the latest El Salvador Bitcoin news, and it's all pretty stunning. [Marc Falzon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVAx57Ffxvg) did some great reporting from there and I recommend his video on the subject. Basically there have been some protests in El Salvador against BTC adoption, and the state-run Chivo wallet is not great. Chivo is a full KYC wallet, it relies on Strike's proprietary Lightning nodes, and it just doesn't work very well. People are understandably suspicious of the wallet but it has potential for remittances, which account for 20% of El Salvador's GDP. 

But the biggest news is the Blockstream/Bitfinex/El Salvador partnership, they're ""issuing a billion USD bond on Blockstream's Liquid network"" to ""build a Bitcoin City"".  How anyone could trust Bitfinex, the issuer of Tether, or Blockstream, the company that singlehandedly KILLED BITCOIN, with their money is a mystery to me. More concerning is how obvious the link between Blockstream and Tether printer Bitfinex has become. It's looking more and more like Blockstream works closely with Bitfinex to manipulate all crypto prices, but especially BTC. Finally, the Bitcoin City project looks like a classic ""bridge to nowhere"" type of boondoggle.  

Bukele was merely a fool to work with clueless idiots like Peter McCormack and Jack Mallers, but now he's literally making a deal with the devil. I cannot imagine how this will end well for El Salvador and the BTC project there.",22,btc,2022-01-05 08:47:27

It got simpler and more powerful at  the same time. It now enables generic BCH output groups that can be used  to create persistent Script covenant contracts that can prove their  genuineness. This is something that current contracts [cannot do](https://old.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/rasju1/limits_of_introspection_and_why_we_need_pmv3group/), even with the new [Introspection](https://gitlab.com/GeneralProtocols/research/chips/-/blob/master/CHIP-2021-02-Add-Native-Introspection-Opcodes.md) opcodes. Group would make it possible because the groupID is a commitment to the whole genesis transaction, but this is not a post about that.

Introspection made it possible to have outputs be dependent, owned by other outputs. The [""sticker""](https://old.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/r9h7xl/introspection_opcodes_are_so_cool_heres_a_teaser/)  contract is a simple example of that. Here I want to show what is  possible if we define the owner as any output member of some group.

In other words, with Group it would be possible to write a contract  that requires a specific token to be spent. In effect, the token's group  becomes the owner of the so dependent output. The redeem script is very  simple:

    OP_UTXOGROUPID
    <0x8837f7609b501cb22db52f91a5a5ef114546ddc75c076172e70f4582903680cb>
    OP_EQUAL

That's it? That's it. What this Script means in human language is  this: ""Tell me the index of the input where a member of my owner group  is being spent. I will then verify that it indeed matches my owner  group, and if yes I will allow you to spend from me"".

The <0x8837...> is the groupID and  here it works like an address. Difference is, the ""address"" can change  owners independent of this output. The public keys of group members are  attached to other outputs, and any one of them can be spent alongside  this one to take the funds.

The signature is then just this (if owner output is being spent as index 0 input):

    <0>

The input 0 could be some P2PKH group token, where the spender could  spend both outputs, and send the token and contract change back to some new addresses.  Even if he changes the address, it would be the same token, and the  token could be used to spend from the above contract here.

This makes it possible to have a single payment address: the  contract. Spending any number of UTXOs is done by spending a  single P2PKH output, and updating it with the new address at the same  time.

**This makes it possible to reuse a P2SH address without ever having to reuse the key!** This is because token is the key, and token's owner can change on each spend.",45,btc,2022-01-05 15:57:24

Bukele made this statement on his personal Twitter account on January 2, in which he also ventured to predict that the[ cryptocurrency development](https://www.blockchainx.tech/crypto-currency-development) will reach $ 100,000, that it will become an important electoral issue in the US elections, or that Bitcoin City will begin construction.

Legalization in two other countries has been the point at which Green has set his sights, which has raised the stakes. ""I would go even further than him. I think three other nations are likely to follow El Salvador's pioneering and future-oriented leadership in the digital age,"" he said.

"" Low-income countries have suffered for a long time because their currencies are weak and extremely vulnerable to market changes and this triggers rampant inflation. This is why most developing countries depend on the major 'first world' currencies. , like the US dollar, to carry out their transactions, ""he argues.

This brings with it a number of problems that are often ""very costly . "" A strong US dollar will weigh on the economic outlook for emerging markets.

That is why, by adopting a cryptocurrency as legal tender, "" these countries immediately have a currency that is not influenced by market conditions within their own economy, nor directly by the economy of another country,"" according to the chief. by deVere.

Green gets to venture, like many of Bukele's followers, and points to Panama, Paraguay, Guatemala and Honduras as some of the states that could follow El Salvador, ""due to their similar dependence on remittances.""

""Right after El Salvador's adoption in September, Panama announced a bill to make cryptocurrency legal tender in the country. In addition, Congressman Gabriel Silva tweeted that this could create jobs in Panama and attract investment from others. nations, ""says the expert.

Some central banks are studying the [development of cryptocurrencie](https://www.blockchainx.tech/crypto-currency-development)s, in this line, although Green believes that many will end up adopting an existing one, such as bitcoin.",0,btc,2022-01-06 07:24:55
rx8x0v,yokesh351,9,https://redd.it/rx8x0v,None,Airbnb would implement payments with bitcoin and cryptocurrencies in 2022,"Implementing the option of payments with bitcoin (BTC) and other cryptocurrencies is among Airbnb's priorities for 2022. This is clear from a thread of tweets published this Wednesday, January 5 by Brian Chesky, executive director of the popular accommodation rental market .

On Sunday, January 2, Chesky asked his followers for suggestions on the social network about the updates that Airbnb should implement in 2022. After 7 days he received some 4,000 responses to the initial tweet , so this Wednesday he proceeded to list the 7 most mentioned.

As he commented, **the main suggestion was to add payments with** [**cryptocurrencies development**](https://www.blockchainx.tech/crypto-currency-development)**, such as bitcoin**. Later, he clarified that users proposed a variety of tokens to be included among Airbnb's means of payment, which shows that they may choose to enable payments with various cryptocurrencies.

Other suggestions mentioned by the executive are the clear display of prices, a guest loyalty program, updated cleaning rates, more stays and long-term discounts, adding coworking spaces, as well as improving customer service. Airbnb would already be working on implementing all the suggestions from the public during the course of this year.

Airbnb is a popular online platform that allows you to find and book vacation rentals around the world. The company, founded in 2008, has processed payments of $ 336 billion since 2013.

## Airbnb had been preparing to add cryptocurrencies

Since 2019, users of bitcoin and other [cryptocurrencies development](https://www.blockchainx.tech/crypto-currency-development) could pay their Airbnb rentals with their tokens through the Bitrefill platform, as reported by CriptoNoticias in a timely manner. By then, the modality was available only for the United States, and for rentals of up to 28 days.

Later, at the end of 2020, it was known that **the company had among its future plans to invest in the incorporation of new technologies such as cryptocurrencies and tokenization**. At that time, they specifically considered the integration of new payment methods such as cryptocurrencies, to avoid being left out of the innovation.

In an interview released in September 2021 by the Fox news portal, Brian Chesky said that he had received many requests to add cryptocurrencies as a payment method over the years. At that time, he claimed to have no ads in this regard, but mentioned, as a curious fact, that the CEO of Coinbase used to work for Airbnb. ""We are very proud of their success,"" Chesky commented.",0,btc,2022-01-06 07:43:55

It's a sticky subject for the West as they benefit from the current Kazakh government, so for now they're calling it a ""protest"". Given the amount of gunfire, burning, and sacking of banks going on, it's unlikely that this is not an organized and armed assault on the government. Also, a statue of the president was ripped down, a hallmark of recent CIA coups. Biden will meet with Putin on Ukraine this week, so there is an obvious motive to strain Russian military capacity and thereby sustain Ukraine's US puppet government.

Kazakhstan is notable in the crypto scene for its vast BTC mining farms. KZ became a destination of choice for fleeing Chinese miners  in 2021.  At one point last year, KZ surpassed 20% of the total BTC hashrate. As of yesterday, Internet service for the entire country has been shut down. Power plants are also running at lowered capacity and the country is paralyzed. However, BTC hashrate right now is *trending UP*! Although it's possible that KZ miners have satellite net connections, I find it odd that we're not seeing a hashrate drop. And I do wonder if shutting down KZ miners is a cute little ancillary benefit for those behind this coup...

&#x200B;

*NOW IS THE TIME TO BUY THE BLOOD IN THE STREETS!*

&#x200B;

Many investors in Chinese listed companies have been decimated in 2021, in particular ADR‚Äôs. Collusion between short sellers, and regulators have had Chinese companies hit new fresh 52-week lows.  This has been a perfect storm for Chinese listed companies as they have seen increasing short interest and FUD. They now have a chance to rise from the ashes in 2022 with investors flocking towards this amazing investment opportunity. Below, we will list 3 China based companies who will have an amazing 2022.

&#x200B;

* The regulatory storm that decimated U.S.-listed Chinese stocks last year is winding down, with shares likely to recover lost ground in 2022.
* By lowering the threshold for secondary listings, the Hong Kong Stock      Exchange is becoming more attractive to small and mid-cap U.S.-listed Chinese companies.
* Valuations for big Chinese tech companies have hit new lows.

&#x200B;

Chinese stocks, hobbled by regulatory pressures and uneven economic growth, also plummeted in 2021. The [FXI China large-cap ETF](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/FXI) fell 21% in its worst year since 2008.

Chinese listed companies have experienced a market crash. Couple this with short selling abuse and FUD spreading, you get stocks that have fallen 90% from their previous highs.

&#x200B;

# Now is the time to BUY

You will now be able to partake in **one of the biggest wealth increasing opportunities** in your lifetimes. In these 3 tickers, investors should see healthy returns.

&#x200B;

# Alibaba, SOS Limited, and IQIYI

&#x200B;

# ALIBABA:

Chinese e-commerce giant **Alibaba Group** ([NYSE:BABA](https://www.fool.com/quote/nyse/baba/)) stock had a rough year in 2021. As the [Chinese tech stock market](https://www.fool.com/investing/stock-market/types-of-stocks/international-stocks/) imploded, Alibaba shares shed roughly 50% of their value, costing outside investors in excess of $300 billion in stock market losses.

Now, it‚Äôs looking like it may be the perfect time to buy this Tech Behemoth. Alibaba has $43.4 billion more cash than debt -- and Alibaba's cash-adjusted P/E ratio is just 15.2, and its cash-adjusted P/FCF ratio is an enticingly cheap 12.4.

It's hard to find a company with a more impressive track record of growth than Alibaba. The company has a five-year annualized earnings growth rate of 27%.

In layman‚Äôs terms, It‚Äôs a GOOD BUY

&#x200B;

**PT $240**

&#x200B;

# SOS Limited: 

Ah yes, the famous SOS Limited, the Chinese based insurance marketer turned Crypto Miner. This stock had a fraudulent short selling scheme take place on it. Where short sellers colluded to crush the share price and entice investors to keep buying as they sold them option contracts.

However, all that looks bad may not be what it seems. SOS Limited has now moved its HQ to New York City. Currently, they are constructing a blockchain super center in Wisconsin, which should be complete February 1st according to many sources and locals of Niagara, WI. They had a 1700% increase in revenue this year, taking a stab at commodity trading while they organize for their crypto super center.

Currently, SOS Limited is last in the race against all its peers. It is a perfect buying opportunity as it hovers around 52-week lows awaiting news. We believe the news is coming soon. Best to beat the crowds on plays like this. For those of you who question the legitimacy of this company, you can email the directors who are US citizens. Douglas Brown, independent director of SOS Limited has confirmed the legitimacy of SOS Limited and their mining plans. 

SOS Limited has an **analyst PT of $20**

&#x200B;

# IQIYI:

Is approaching a major achievement in its business, so we would like to shine some light on the company. iQIYI, Inc., together with its subsidiaries, provides online entertainment services under the iQIYI brand in the People‚Äôs Republic of China. The US$3.4b market-cap company posted a loss in its most recent financial year of CN¬•7.0b and a latest trailing-twelve-month loss of CN¬•6.0b shrinking the gap between loss and breakeven.

IQIYI is the ‚ÄúNetflix‚Äù of China who will most likely be a profitable company in the near future. It is a good idea to add this one to the 2022 comeback portfolio.

**PT of $15**

‚ÄúNot only is the fork (Bitcoin Cash) unable to gain economic value, it is also dogged with a serious technical problem that renders it almost unusable. Seeing as the new chain has the same hashing algorithm as Bitcoin, miners can utilize their processing power on both chains and receive rewards in both. But because Bitcoin's coins are far more valuable than Bitcoin Cash, the processing power behind Bitcoin remains far higher than that of Bitcoin Cash, and Bitcoin miners can shift to Bitcoin Cash any time the rewards get high. This leaves Bitcoin Cash in an unfortunate dilemma: if the mining difficulty is too high, then there will be a long delay for blocks to be produced and transactions to process. But if the difficulty is set too low, the coin is mined very quickly and the supply increases quickly. This increases the supply of the Bitcoin Cash coins faster than the Bitcoin chain, and would lead to the coin reward for Bitcoin Cash running out very quickly, thus reducing the incentive for future miners to mine it. Most likely, this will have to lead to a hard fork that adjusts the supply growth to continue offering rewards to miners.‚Äù

LocalCoinSwap is by far the best P2P crypto exchange service in existence. It's low fees and permanent No-KYC status make it the only realistic site for people that want to stay fully off the grid, or simply just don't have the necessary documentation to identify themselves.

One thing that infuriated me with sites such as Binance, LocalBitcoin and Paxful, was that you could probably only make 1 or 2 trades if you were lucky, before they would need identification. LocalCoinSwap always keeps its integrity and stays KYC free at al times.

Did I mention ID isn't even required to sell crypto, which for me is unheard of.

Another benefit I found is the low-fees. The first ever time I bought BTC, I used Paxful. I bought ¬£20 worth of BTC and guess what I ended up with; ¬£13.00....

For small amounts of Crypto the fees on these sites can almost half your funds, now obviously this isn't completely the sites fault as sellers charge ridiculous amounts and should be held accountable too, however, I found the average above market value on LocalCoinSwap to be around 10% when on other sites it would average around 20-27%.

The fees on LocalCoinSwap's end are virtually non-existent, buying ¬£20 worth of BTC will leave you with no less than ¬£18, which in the P2P marketplace scene is just amazing. Same sacrifice you would make with the likes of Coinbase.

I hope this post can help some fellow KYC haters not get completely ripped off on their hard earned crypto.

rybao5,frictionfreebase,16,https://redd.it/rybao5,None,We need Bitcoin radiators,"Governments around the world are moving to squash proof of work mining, citing energy waste.  See here for one example: [https://www.theblockcrypto.com/linked/129336/congress-is-preparing-an-oversight-hearing-on-bitcoin-minings-environmental-impact-sources](https://www.theblockcrypto.com/linked/129336/congress-is-preparing-an-oversight-hearing-on-bitcoin-minings-environmental-impact-sources).  Time is ticking for us to address this!

I just read a comment on another thread: ""ASICs are just heaters, producing nothing of value"".  How to miss an opportunity so spectacularly.  Heat itself is valuable!  In fact it‚Äôs extremely valuable in cold/mild climates.  Generating heat is a large and increasing chunk of what electricity in the UK is spent on, for instance.  Gas central heating is being phased out worldwide too, in favor of electrical heating.

Spending such enormous amounts of electricity on heating is fine according to environmentalists for two reasons.  Firstly, heat is a life-or-death necessity, so even if it‚Äôs bad for the environment, we definitely need to swallow the costs anyway.  Secondly, we are moving quickly towards green electricity production, and so installing electrical heating is more sustainable in the long run even though it requires fossil fuel power generation right now.

Bitcoin mining doesn‚Äôt have the same immediate life-or-death value, but it should also be considered green-in-the-long-run in exactly the same way that electrical heating is.

We can go much further and completely kill off the environmental concern about energy use if we simply combine the two services into one.  We just need devices that appear and function like standard residential radiators that produce heat (silently) through mining.  Then, instead of having giant mining farms wastefully pumping hot air into the environment, we have residential mining radiators where users benefit fully from the generated heat.  This delivers a net reduction in waste.  The user creates both valuable heat and valuable crypto mining with the same energy use.

If such a product were in existence, and especially if it were widely popular, politicians would have a very hard time arguing that such devices should be rendered inoperable.

In addition to addressing energy concerns, getting such devices into homes and workspaces would benefit crypto and especially BCH in several ways:

&#x200B;

1. It‚Äôs an excellent way to get crypto directly into the hands of people without them having to buy it from centralized and corruptible exchanges.
2. It would significantly help decentralize hash power.
3. Given that users would probably only generate small amounts of crypto per day, it would preferentially benefit cryptos with efficient transactions -- BCH being the prime candidate.
4. Many more people earning small amounts of crypto would boost casual merchant spending.
5. It would encourage people to receive and hold crypto on real wallets, rather than third party web wallets or exchange accounts ‚Äì it‚Äôs just far quicker and easier to install a wallet than get set up with such custodial accounts.
6. The ASICs in such devices need not be state-of-the-art to be viable.  They need only help *reduce* heating costs.
7. Because of point 6 above, the radiators could/should be engineered in such a way that they can accept retrofitted second hand components from industrial mines.  By such an arrangement, we would then be able to show (in the short/medium term) that the devices are not only environmentally friendly in running cost, but also in fabrication!  Instead of uneconomical ASICs just going to waste, they could be recycled into such heaters.
8. If such devices became popular, it would gradually move the share of mining income away from enormous professional miners -- who currently benefit from significant economies of scale -- and towards a much more diffuse spread of individuals.  In the long run, only those who can make full use of the ‚Äúwaste‚Äù heat would be able to mine economically.  This seems to me to guarantee a much more even and in many ways fairer distribution of income across the world.  
 

Even though such an arrangement would undermine the businesses of existing large miners, I hope they appreciate that governments are coming for them anyway.  Why not pivot towards helping to produce, deploy, market, maintain or ship such a waste-free mining industry and save Bitcoin itself, rather than go down with the ship?

A standard response to any of these concerns is that proof of stake is clearly less wasteful and we should just move over to that.  If we were to do so, however, we would lose out on the benefits of points 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 8 above.

# The [@federalreserve](https://twitter.com/federalreserve) has become slave to [\#WallStreet](https://twitter.com/hashtag/WallStreet?src=hashtag_click). With current INTEREST RATES at 0% the Fed would have to raise rates higher than the current INFLATION RATE of 6.5% .. So the Fed would have to raise INTEREST RATES from 0% to 7 or 8% which would completely crash the economy.

It is the [@federalreserve](https://twitter.com/federalreserve)'s JOB to come out every Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4, and Fiscal Year to tell the US Economy what it's plans are. Everytime the Fed puts FUD out into the market by LYING ABOUT RAISING INTEREST RATES [#WallStreet](https://twitter.com/hashtag/WallStreet?src=hashtag_click) has a tantrum and everybody Liquidates/Dumps their stock.

The [@federalreserve](https://twitter.com/federalreserve) has more than DOUBLED their mortgage backed assets during the last 2 years ALONE by $4,000,000,000,000.00 Trillion Dollars. Easy money to go get Loans from the bank at 0% Interest; Why would [#WallStreet](https://twitter.com/hashtag/WallStreet?src=hashtag_click) want INTEREST RATES to go up? They don't.

The [@federalreserve](https://twitter.com/federalreserve), like CHINA, can only create so much FUD behind Cryptocurrency & the World Economy before PEOPLE JUST DON'T BELIEIVE THEM ANYMORE. They haven't raised Interest Rates in DECADES! They can't do it now EVEN BY .25% every Q1 because it would crash the US Economy.  
The [@USTreasury](https://twitter.com/USTreasury) has printed more Fiat-Currency in the last 2 years than it has during the entire history of America. The [@federalreserve](https://twitter.com/federalreserve) is OWNED by [#WallStreet](https://twitter.com/hashtag/WallStreet?src=hashtag_click). After their FUD about raising Interest Rates dwindles down like it always does, the market will bounce back. #BTC #DOGE #DOGECOIN #CryptoCurrency  
GOLD is a non-interest bearing asset. IF the [@federalreserve](https://twitter.com/federalreserve) does increase interest rates by 0.25% every Quarter for a target of 1% EOY (which they won't) ..

Will people actually make that change when sending fiat has become just as fast and nearly as convenient compared to 2011 ? Today people are able to buy goods and services and send money to friends and family with ease. Will the masses use the blockchain for all their purchases or just stick to the convenience of buying goods & sending money today via centralized systems ?

1. can use Purse.io to ""Earn"" BCH by filling Amazon orders. you buy amazon wishlist stuff, vet the ""Shopper"" to make sure they have some credibility, then buy their items at a 5-15% markup and get BCH. added bonus is the 5% back on Chase or AmEx's Amazon credit card, or if you're like me, you buy with 18-month 0% APR during the dips, then pay before interest is due (assuming you believe the dips will pay back more than your investment, and assuming you stay on top of your dates).

2. BCH is almost always cheap and quick to send, unlike how a lot of people got burned in 2017+ when BTC got its $1 to $50 fees, taking many hours. you can also use BCH for a discount to pay for stuff like a VPN (mullvad.net gives a % off).

3. BCH can be used directly (sometimes with BitPay KYC, sometimes directly to a business's website) to buy precious metals. you can have your crypto on a non-IRS-audited exchange like CoinEx.com for trades, keep BCH on a phone/hot wallet for routine purchases or sending friends, and a cold/hardware/paper wallet for making big buys. you can buy a massive amount of gold/silver/platinum coins/bars on sites like MoneyMetals.com, APMEx.com, JMBullion.com, etc. using BCH and then keep bullion as a hedge against inflation (if you think the UD Dollar/economy/housing market is going to have issues in the near future). this site shows good price information https://findbullionprices.com/ and i wrote about using BCH to buy physical metals here https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7lqji2/bulliongoldsilver_coins_using_bitcoin_cashbch_a/

 I understand the two go to's here are either looking for a hard wallet or a web wallet. For the latter I have a list of ambiguous accounts he's written, for the former I have to Frankenstein his old computers which at the time were probably state of the art with a whopping 1-2gb of RAM.

s0pmgi,SMACz42,3,https://redd.it/s0pmgi,None,Podcast Index focuses on LN as sole implementation of RSS Feed Montetization Strategy,"Merged in 2 months ago, the only implmentation of the [Value-for-Value spec](https://github.com/Podcastindex-org/podcast-namespace/blob/main/value/value.md) is the Lightning Network.

> Here we describe an additional ""block"" of XML that gives podcasters (and other media creators) a way to receive direct payments from their audience in response to the action of viewing or listening to a created work. Utilizing so called ""Layer 2"" cryptocurrency networks like Lightning, and possibly other digital currency mechanisms, near real-time micropayments can be directly sent from listener or viewer to the creator without the need for a payment processor or other ""middle men"".
>
> When a media listener (such as within a podcast app) presses the play button on an episode who's feed contains a value block, a compatible app will be expected to begin streaming micro-payments to the designated recipients on a time interval that makes sense for the app.
>
> [LN] is the only type currently in active use. Others are under development and will be added to the list as they see some measure of adoption, or at least a working example to prove viability.
>
> Currently, development is centered mostly on Lightning using the ""keysend"" method. Keysend allows for push based payments without the recipient needing to generate an invoice to receive them. Another method to send spontaneous payments via Lightning is AMP, atomic multipath payments.

Don‚Äôt throw Roger Ver out front.  And there was more than one ardent supporter, BUT don‚Äôt base the future on the past, because the past doesn‚Äôt last!  And the past might come back so fast that will make your coin crash!  

Don‚Äôt justify his behavior.  Evading taxes.  Pleading guilty and going to jail for selling 49 pounds of explosives as ‚Äúfireworks‚Äùto families and people on eBay.  üö© üö© üö© 

People can search for themselves, criminal records are public property!  No need for me to even paste anything.  But thank you! And don‚Äôt thank me, thank God for bringing me time to come to your community and enrich those who‚Äôs minds are open! 

Don‚Äôt just focus on tech ‚Ä¶ ecosystem matters!  Who ‚Äúshills‚Äù your coin matters!  Open source nature matters (for all coins)!  And third parties add security threat risk (SmartBCH is a whole separate chain, with a voting system centered by hashpower, with a **third-party** bridge holding the two together!) 

They **need** your trust!  Be prudent.  You will hear ‚Äúwhat are the chances‚Äù ‚Äî and if you have to calculate‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs not optimal! 

Look for coins that have tokenization on-chain!  Diversification is key.  The loudest people that speak against me in this sub are the ones with the heaviest BCH bags.  Sure, BCH is a top 10 P2P cash, and that‚Äôs all you should think about it.  It does work, like others.  But that‚Äôs not all you have to think of it.  

- you have to think about the community behind it.  Who the leaders are, who the second line is, what interests have they had in the past, etc.

(Honestly, any coin will work as P2P payment with the wallet apps and addresses.  And for merchant adoption, if they don‚Äôt have direct crypto payment, they may work with one of these [15 Best Cryptocurrency Payment Gateways](https://www.finextra.com/blogposting/20906/15-best-cryptocurrency-payment-gateways).  

- It is absolutely stupid marketing for Roger Ver u/memorydealers to go around his Tax Haven, slapping stickers on small businesses, and providing them with smartphones and downloading his software.  

- Partner with a top payment gateway and drive adoption of the gateway.  Build partnerships and relationships with other people in commerce

- As they are catching on, and create a SIMPLE VIDEO, it‚Äôs called an ADVERTISEMENT.  Nobody cares about long ass 15 minute videos throwing shade.  A message can be simple: ‚ÄúFor the lowest fees, when you can, use Bitcoin Cash‚Äù

Instead of buying SMARTPHONES FOR BUSINESSES AND BOTS FOR YOUR SUB‚Ä¶ purchase advertising.  There is a wide price ranges, some affordable.  Advertising is education for the masses; not Reddit.

Another coin that is young is Ravencoin, it has cheap transactions, more transactions per block, faster transactions, and has tokenization on chain.  They are a Bitcoin Soft Fork.  Do research on the relationships here (Medici Ventures, Patrick Byrne CEO of Overstock.com, and more).  You can criticize Patrick but you will be criticizing his BUSINESS ACUMEN and history‚Ä¶ not his jailtime.

The people surround this coin don‚Äôt know how to drive a business, and as much as you believe in tech: People Matter

There‚Äôs not a damn thing Roger Ver can teach me about marketing and business acumen‚Ä¶ aside from not needing a lesson from a tax-evading excon‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs 2022, he is out here fucking up, no direction, giving used android smartphones to small shops, but no one is running in with their BCH much less spending and replacing. 

Go to r/bch and find someone who can navigate and leverage relationships‚Ä¶ although the damage may already be done.  You‚Äôve fallen from $31B marketcap to $7 marketcap in 5 years.  My words are not false claims. 

There are 1,000‚Äôs of people who can elevate BCH or any P2P cash better in a 5 years span.  It‚Äôs 2022 and we‚Äôre handing out smartphones.  

Upgrade your people or perish.

>I just saw bitcoin ""roundtable"" - funny by the way, good joke :) announcement, as community wants higher block size by now, this problem should be first priority now. I have few concerns about it. I think it's the best place to talk about this, since most of threads started on /r/Bitcoin become censored very fast, not sure why not sure by who exactly. **But let's move strictly to my questions if we all want Bitcoin to succeed and not be only source of income for Chinese miners with cheap technology and electricity. We all must agree that block size is mostly full by now, and in case any dynamical price change or/and new users boom - bitcoins will be very hard to transfer with reasonable fee, also bitcoin may lose chance to be adopted and used by new users.**  
>  
>1.Why force SW before changing blocksize to 2mb as temporary fix ? HF code to 2mb is already created, implemented and tested in Bitcoin Classic, it's very simple change, I think SegWit needs much more time to test and reveal potential bugs and risks.  
2.If core team, really needs so much time to implement HF, why static solution - which will only change date when block size problem re-occur. We should implement dynamic solution for instance based on previous blocks (but there are some few other interesting bips also) And please don't say anything about disk space and centralization, disk space is cheap, and become cheaper and cheaper from year to year. Internet connection speed also shouldn't be a problem, just look back what we had few years ago. Satoshi couple times mentioned that bitcoin wouldn't grow faster than technology will, and nothing currently points that's not true.  
>  
>And to make it clear, seg wit is great but it's not mainly scaleability benefits, it's much more complicated change than simply change blocksize (even it's HF) and more reasonably would be do HF with dynamic block size solution, and then very carefully without hurry test and release segwit.

Could be casted in NORDIC GOLD or ALUMINIUM BRONZE to get the ""gold"" color. Brass is too much yellowish in color.

The ""B"" in center could be patinated in green maybe to act more as BCH coin.

I  was also thinkin that on the back side of the coin to etch maybe a  private key in QR CODE to access whatever will be on ""that coin"" - maybe  a coin that could act like a ""paper wallet"".

As with anything financial related, my dad listens intently. He then turns to me and asks, ""What's up with this Bitcoin?"" I explain that it's a decentralized way of having more power over your finances, whether you decide to spend or save it. He questions how nothing can be that easy and that there must be a margin, to which I reply something along the lines of, ""With Bitcoin Cash, the transaction fee is miniscule. It's meant to be used to sent and received."" I show him a recent transaction with the fee on my phone. He's engaged and sounds genuinely interested.

Definition: A ‚Äúdeath cross‚Äù is a technical pattern that indicates an investment downturn. It usually refers to the 50-day moving average falling below the 200-day moving average.

Numbers: Bitcoin‚Äôs price peaked two months ago at around $69,000. Since then, the price has declined by 40%. Bitcoin has declined over 10% so far in 2022, the worst start for Bitcoin in a decade.

Catalyst: The selloff likely happened due to the Federal Reserve‚Äôs 2022 plans to trim its balance sheet and raise interest rates.

History: Past ‚Äúdeath crosses‚Äù for Bitcoin signaled further declines on certain occasions. However, there were also times went it meant nothing.

Final Thoughts: Despite the selloff, many investors remain bullish that Bitcoin could reach $100,000 this year.

I am writing this to remind myself of why I do the things that I do and put myself through the things I put myself through. I'm doing this for the times where I forget, or become overwhelmed by the copious amount of adversity.

The pursuit of freedom, liberty, autonomy, whatever you want to call it is truly noble. However, we must not forget that there are those who do not play by the same rules as us.

There are those for whom sustainability means nothing. Where a pump-and-dump makes good business sense. Where using coercion and sockpuppeting is simply using another tool in their marketing strategy arsenal.

We don't take these tactics, because not only do we think they are detrimental to ourselves, but to others as well. And having faith that we are on the right side of history means that we need to live by our values. That our strategy of building cool things and helping others is the only way forward for us.

Yes, this leaves us vulnerable to the occasional rug-pull, or Mt. Gox fiasco. Yes, this means that we get to fight off trolls from other projects left and right. Yes, this means that we have to explain over and over again why fundamental principles are preferable to populist hype.

Nobody said that freedom is fair. Or life for that matter. What we're working towards isn't ""the perfect system"". All we can promise is the freedom to lift your standard of living up; as you work to help lift others' up too.

I didn‚Äôt read the sub, I clicked ‚Äú+join‚Äù and went on to search for more subreddits to read about later.

(As many people probably do.)

Over the next month, I kept getting Bitcoin Cash posts in my feed.  I had ‚Äúknown‚Äù that I **never** joined a Bitcoin Cash (BCH) sub because I had no interest in learning about BCH. 

It was then, I finally clicked into the sub, noticed the green symbol as the subreddit logo‚Ä¶ and scrolled down pages of posts.  They were all Anti-BTC and Pro-BCH.

I thought ‚Äúwow, ok‚Äù

When I would bring this up to anyone‚Ä¶ I was met by several long-winded ‚Äúexplanations‚Äù of why this is a BCH sub. 

The one that really disgusted me was: ‚Äúoh‚Ä¶ BTC stands for Bitcoin.  This is for *all Bitcoin talk*‚Äù üö©üö©üö© 

I saw this and everything in my college-educated and twice graduated brain said ‚Äúthis is not how nomenclature works‚Äù

I don‚Äôt care about your communities beef with r/bitcoin, I really don‚Äôt care about about that sub nor interact with it 

I care about:
- Clarity 
- Honesty
- Ethics
- The Product
- People

When it comes to trusting my money or supporting a business.  Marcus Lemonis calls this ‚ÄúPeople, product, process‚Äù 

Your product is ok, but the people and process are off.  You need all three in motion to take off as a business.  I firmly believe that.  

Your process?:
- Continue to sit in r/btc 
- Catch newcomers
- Attempt to educate them on this communities mission
- Convert their BTC search into hating BTC and choosing BCH.

Some people are fine with choosing BCH.  Some people leave unannounced.  Some of me see ‚Äúbusiness‚Äù and sniff out shady practice.  Sorry, that‚Äôs how I see things.  I am fascinated with business and methodologies of promoting a brand.  

My ‚Äúattacks‚Äù are on people and process.  And I stay, so ‚Äúnewcomers‚Äù are also educated.  Not everything is rosey.  

If you guys wouldn‚Äôt have catfished me, I wouldn‚Äôt be here.  Point blank. 

- it‚Äôs like people being racist against ‚Äúblack‚Äù, but their people are the ones who literally brought them against their will years ago.

Anyway, that‚Äôs the short answer to ‚Äúwhy I am in r/btc if you don‚Äôt like the coin‚Äù

I‚Äôm creating a chronicle on r/BTCActiveCatfishByBTC because in the future I won‚Äôt have time to do this because I won‚Äôt always be on quarantine.  So at least my thoughts and counters to some of the common and mundane arguments will be easily accessible.

Remember,

#People, Products, Process

Your product is fine‚Ä¶ but handing out used smartphones and calling it adoption?  Failed effort in process

Here‚Äôs a simple example of all three hitting, and you will hate it, but it‚Äôs true.

People - Elon Musk and Mark Cuban
Product - DOGE, works fine as P2P
Process - Strategic marketing and ‚Äúshilling‚Äù 

Boom, simple.  If you have all three, you can succeed.  Sure define success in any way but I can spend my DOGE natively in many places I ‚Äúcould‚Äù spend BCH.   

Sometimes BCH is even not included as an option with some merchants I‚Äôve seen.   

Have I purposely pissed some people off?  Sure.  But it‚Äôs because I feel their stance is closed-minded and immutable.  

But usually, you can see my criticisms and you can file them under:

s221j0,TinosNitso,24,https://redd.it/s221j0,None,CashFusion of 11 BCH with a 6.25 BCH coinbase reward! (Throwaway seed below.),"The miner of block [721997](https://www.blockchain.com/bch/block/721997) (9 Jan) sent their reward to 1 [intermediate](https://www.blockchain.com/bch/address/qpw2ux5gqqjs6e9x8cx020e88y5m908j65ywxxq428) a few days later, and then within a couple hours (today) it [fused](https://www.blockchain.com/bch/tx/5d5bee315788684bc103fedbb499cc78a7c08f1fdbb449f97542835edad1e343) directly with my single 11 BCH coin (listed on top of inputs).

Are there any stats on **coinbase** CashFusions? Technically an intermediate was used, so it may not have been the miner. (Edit: Reducing block time could increase the # of fresh coins being fused, and reduce the amount needed.)

A couple weeks ago I posted [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/rpr1a6/cashfusion_currently_requires_us500_minimum/) & [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoincash/comments/rr48nw/6_bch_3k_recommended_minimum_for_cashfusion_quick/) at r/Bitcoincash that there's a minimum on the order of a thousand dollars, however that's proven to be **false**. I had to do more testing. I managed to [fuse](https://www.blockchain.com/bch/tx/6ed0161c78b26a630303dbd0fdcbcdf40b814478789f5fbb88b2fa46ac4148dd) about $12 using [Pokket.cash](https://Pokket.cash). Beforehand I also [fused](https://www.blockchain.com/bch/tx/4a57510185b37dcf7383ed8f83642092608d956a3f416fd3884abce2d2cd00b9) a $4 coin within Electron Cash using all default settings, within a couple hours.

The **11 BCH** ($4k) seed was:

>jewel cute aspect unfold burst royal length pool tape glare spoon ceiling

I had it set to *Fan-Out* *Fusion mode* with *Self-Fusing*. It did a 1‚á¢10. Before I noticed, it immediately proceeded to double-fuse within a single txn (1‚á¢12 & 1‚á¢13). Maybe there could be an option to only fuse once/day. In that wallet I started with 6 BCH but that didn't fuse, so tried 7, 8, 9, 10 & 11 BCH & they all failed (default settings within a couple hours). Then I tried *Self-Fusing* which failed, but I think that only works with at least 2 coins. Then I also applied *Fan-Out* and it finally fused (within a couple hours).

A 6 BCH seed (Jan 10) was:

>comfort debate champion style casino gravity snow wealth fork tornado snap problem

That one fused within a couple hours using only default settings. Another one (\~$4) was:

>fork ridge ensure flee mom autumn plastic knife camp cute nest pony

All used `m/44'/145'/0'` (default derivation path). Throwing away seeds might be a **bad** idea, but I figure showing off 1 or 2 is ok. They may not be safe if someone's wallet tries to send money to them. Also it partially ruins the fusions they were involved in.

Apologies to u/_pokkst & u/imaginary_username for insisting there's a **minimum**. u/don2468 helped with a couple examples. I was probably just having bad-luck, and increasing amounts happened to work, for a while. Using *Fan-out* in *Wallet Fusion Settings* helped.

I've released an [update](https://github.com/TinosNitso/AutoCove-Plugin/releases/tag/v1.0.6) to AutoCove (EC Script plugin) with asm & dark-theme support, an op-counter and TXID lookup. However it still needs another update.

**Edit**: It turns out this isn't the first time I've fused with a coinbase reward. There was also [this](https://www.blockchain.com/bch/tx/8b6755f11191d371fa92053d20b86558c1b57a58be6b41da0c31af1e5ca71140) fusion where my 6.19 BCH (on top) fused (within half an hour) with the 6.25 BCH reward from block [719378](https://www.blockchain.com/bch/block/719378).

From what I understand, transactions are verified and added as a block to the blockchain once someone wins a proof-of-work. Essentially, they guessed a number faster than everyone else so they get to add the block the the blockchain. My question is, how are they verifying that the transactions within the block make sense (i.e. how are they checking that the people who are sending the bitcoin actually have the bitcoin in their wallet). I have some friends that do mining and they certainly have never considered this, they just use their GPUs to help others guess numbers in hopes that they win some btc lol",13,btc,2022-01-12 16:21:58

s2j2ed,tradr_fun,35,https://redd.it/s2j2ed,‚å® Discussion,Public Advertising Campaign for BCH,"# Preface: 

I've been in Bitcoin since 2012 but have moved 99% of my crypo holdings over to BCH, so I have a big incentive to see this coin take off and be used as peer-to-peer digital cash and I think advertising is one of the best ways to get the word out there. I posted previously [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/rfn3wm/george_had_a_great_idea_with_starting_a_bch/) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/s1m4f5/i_want_to_start_advertising_for_bitcoin_cash/).

Over the next couple months I plan on putting few $thousand (something around $10k) into advertising BCH and would love some help and feedback. 

&#x200B;

# The Concept:

I've used this company A\*ads before and like them because they give simply give you a BCH deposit address, you can set it to spend whatever you send and its all automatic once set up. 

I would like to just advertise for ""neutral"" BCH sites like this sub-Reddit, [Bitcoin.com](https://Bitcoin.com) and WhyBitcoinCash.com.

 Here is the basic setup of the campaign:

&#x200B;

# The Ads:

I would love feedback and design help for the ads but below is what I am going to start off running now. I would like to just take the [WhyBitcoinCash.com](https://WhyBitcoinCash.com) and [Bitcoin.com](https://Bitcoin.com) logos and use them to run ads as well but this is kind of boring.

# Contributions: 

A\*ads is not perfect, the reach is rather limited and of course it leaves the account in just one person's control. Can anyone come up with a better way to accept donations to advertise with? I love the idea of like a SmartBCH contract that waits until a certain level is met, then pays out everything to a\*ads. That way only a small amount is ever in the a\*ad ads account at any given time. Here is the current deposit address and QR code:

# Etc.

I was going to make a website but that seems dumb now. All we need is a way to make donations. I think a smart contract is the way to go and will be looking into it. Thanks",27,btc,2022-01-12 22:37:19

s2tdq1,yokesh351,9,https://redd.it/s2tdq1,None,"A third of Americans will buy Bitcoin by the end of 2022, according to Ric Edelman","The future is bright for Bitcoin, according to Ric Edelman, founder of financial advisory firm Edelman Financial Engines.

Bitcoin ( BTC ) bull and Edelman Financial Engines founder Ric Edelman has made some promising predictions about the future of the seminal cryptocurrency.

In an interview on CNBC's ETF Edge show on Monday, Edelman said :

""We're already at a quarter of that number, with 24% of Americans owning Bitcoin. It won't be that hard to get to a third. Bitcoin is getting more and more popular. People hear about it everywhere: no It is going away"".

Although 2022 has had a rocky start, in his opinion, governments, companies, foundations, and pension funds are investing in Bitcoin: ""There is a large institutional participation.""

As the author of the forthcoming *The Truth About Crypto*, Edelman is a longtime advocate of[ cryptocurrency development](https://www.blockchainx.tech/crypto-currency-development). In 2019, he described Bitcoin as the first ""genuinely new asset class"" in 150 years, and as early as December 2018, he recommended investors stock up on the orange coin.

In a follow-up interview with CNBC on Tuesday, he lamented that although he has predicted a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) for the past seven years, he is convinced that by 2023 there will be the approval of a spot ETF.

Like Hester Peirce, Commissioner of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, Edelman believes that the SEC is running out of excuses to say no:

""A lot of the SEC's concerns have been resolved by the industry through its own maturity, innovation and development. I'm sure we'll see the SEC say yes because there's no legitimate reason for it not to.""

Matthew Hougan, chief investment officer at Bitwise Asset Management, agreed with him in the second interview.

Hougan said there would be even more protections for investors and a better product thanks to the ""cumulative weight of evidence that will force them to give approval."" The consumer protection offered by an SEC-managed ETF is the icing on the cake of a quality product.

ETF speculation aside, Edelman is prescient about the banality of Satoshi Nakamoto's invention of the future . He succinctly summed it up by saying that Bitcoin ‚Äúis going to be as common in the next couple of years as anything else in a wallet.‚Äù",0,btc,2022-01-13 07:12:22
s2ug0e,RABIT-Rush-8496,7,https://redd.it/s2ug0e,üî£ Misc,How to beat FOMO ON CRYPTO!," 

Hello!

This is RABIT - Robo Advisor for BITcoin! 

Have you ever heard of ""FOMO""? Yes. This means ""\*Fear Of Missing Out""\*\*. 

Volatility in the stock and cryptocurrency markets has increased since COVID-19.  Consequently, many people may think about whether to buy or sell stocks or cryptos.  I'm sure you've thought about it at least once. In this article, I would like to share the direction of how I get rid of my FOMO and win the market.

 

üí° **Summary**

* Remember that short-term fluctuations are really instant movements.
* The surest way is to increase your understanding of the market!
* How to find a strategy that suits your investment profile and preference

 

**When you're suspicious, zoom out of the chart!**

Since the cryptocurrency market often fluctuates by more than 5% a day, those who have just entered the market often regret buying/selling out of impatience while looking at charts going back and forth between heaven and hell. In that case, look at the long-term chart rather than the immediate chart and check the movement of the long-term historical price. Bitcoin recorded a return of 302% in 2020 and 60% in 2021. This is a big return that cannot be compared to the daily fluctuations.

**Let‚Äôs study about markets.**

In the cryptocurrency market, numerous players have an organic influence on each other, and a lot of information comes and goes. Therefore, I need to distinguish scams here and cultivate insights to select the right information for me. It's the surest way, but it's also characterized by accumulating knowledge and know-how over the longest period. Therefore, recently I use a lot of cryptocurrency trading services that separate me from the market and prevent me from being buried.

**Find a strategy that suits you.**

It is also important to choose a strategy that suits your investment profile or preference. In the image below, let's see which strategy suits the best. 

&#x200B;

What results did you get? By any chance, Crypto bot...?

I, who usually lowers volatility and pursues stability, have a strategy called Funding U, which makes steady profits based on arbitrage transactions. I am actually investing in Funding U.

Similar to the staking strategy, volatility is very low, but there is no maturity, and it's been great that I can freely cancel it and deposit it like installment savings account whenever I want. I hope you can also find the right strategy for you.

Rabbit is a brand-new service that provides cryptocurrency trading bots that use various strategies. Measuring investment is conducted based on machine learning and AI. A single AI bot consists of dozens or hundreds of small algorithms. From generating investment signals to executing orders, this service makes the best return when investing, and has algorithms to minimize unexpected transaction costs. Another point that I really like is RABIT charges a fee in the high watermark method and proceed with the claim only when profits are generated. 

With your own Binance wallet and API KEY, you can easily start trading cryptocurrency. AI trading bots invest even when you sleep which means it works 24/7. Since trading is carried out in a wallet owned by the user, there is no consignment risk and you can check the transaction details transparently. From stability to risk-seeking strategies, if you are interested in trading cryptocurrency, try RABIT!

s36b4k,TheWorldofGood,26,https://redd.it/s36b4k,ü§î Opinion,I am still not convinced of the store of value narrative about BTC,"I‚Äôve been watching a lot of BTC maxi videos including Michael Saylor and I even read the book, The Bitcoin Standard.

I mean, I understand why it can be a store of value for all of humanity (haha), but I just don‚Äôt think BTC can scale enough to be the store of value for all billions of people in the world or that its value should be equal to everything on earth which is about 100 trillion dollars including every real estate, stocks, gold, silver, rare materials, etc. that‚Äôs just none sense and crazy.

First of all, why should it equal to 100 trillion dollars? Why should anyone give a damn about BTC? 

Second of all, even if we all believe BTC is the mother of all investments and assets, how will it scale without costing arms and legs for a fee to move it for any average person? If their argument is to use proprietary lightening network, what happens if lightning fails or if a person wants to get his BTC out of lightning? He would still have to pay the BTC fee and that lightning network will have to be used by the other person whom he‚Äôs trading with. It‚Äôs not like Visa or Mastercard unless there will be only two or three proprietary lightning networks owned by mega corporations and banks. 

Third, if we have to use the lightning networks owned and controlled by mega corps or governments like the one in El Salvador, what even was the point of starting Bitcoin in the first place? Wasn‚Äôt the whole point a peer to peer cash? This does not look like a peer to peer but just traditional banking system with a middle man.

Don‚Äôt get me wrong. I do believe that BTC and other cryptocurrencies can have some value in them, otherwise they wouldn‚Äôt worth anything. But to say that BTC should be or will be 100 trillion dollar asset, almost 100 times the size of Apple, Microsoft, and Google, and even bigger than the US government and private assets is just far fetching and ridiculous to me.

I guess my question is what compels the world to accept that BTC should worth that much if it‚Äôs too slow, costly, and does not work as it was originally intended without a middle man like traditional banking system?",25,btc,2022-01-13 18:38:17

s5nd14,utradea,0,https://redd.it/s5nd14,üîä Publicity,$BTC - #1 Trending on Twitter (~70 Million Impressions last 24hrs),"Hey Everyone,

I shared this dashboard we created to track trending stocks and crypto across social media (Twitter, Stocktwits and Reddit). BTC is #1 trending on Twitter over the last 24hrs. In theory, and in practice, the more that people know about a coin, the more likely people are willing to buy it. The sentiment of the tweets also plays a role, so something to keep an eye on as well.

**Tracking Mechanics**

The algorithm pulls data from multiple social platforms. For Twitter we use the Twitter API. It looks at tweets, comments, likes and impressions.

* The change in these metrics are displayed as well as the underlying posts that feed the dashboard, so you can drill into the individual tweets for transparency and sentiment purposes.
* There is also tracking for Reddit and Stocktwits - though Twitter usually has the largest reach.

**Dashboard Screenshot - $BTC is #1**

The screenshot is pulled from the Social Sentiment Dashboard and shows the top trending cryptos this week.

s5wuxt,yokesh351,2,https://redd.it/s5wuxt,None,"""Bitcoin and ethereum will continue to be the king and prince of the market in 2022""","Mart√≠nez-Pardo warns about the ""behavior of bitcoin as a traditional value and not as a refuge""

t has not been a good start to the year for cryptocurrencies. In fact, it has been the worst for bitcoin in its history, with falls that have led the queen of digital assets to lose $40,000 in the session on January 10 when, according to experts, it found a bottom in its recent correction.

As if it were an omen for the rest of the year, the price action has caused many analysts to abandon the bet on a specific time frame for the queen of digital currencies to reach the $100,000 target. Even with everything, it is undeniable that the positive groundswell for these assets persists and that there are numerous vectors of growth that will continue to drive the market. We talked about it with Ramiro Mart√≠nez-Pardo, CEO and co-founder of HeyTrade .

Like other colleagues, he does not dare to give price projections for bitcoin and other 'cryptos' in the short term because ""it is very difficult and we would always be behind reality."" ""The only thing I dare to say is that between $20,000 and $100,000 any prediction we make may be justified and well founded.""

However, he draws an important lesson from 2021, a year in which ""many interesting projects have emerged."" And this is that ""as much as there is talk that both bitcoin and [ethereum development ](https://www.blockchainx.tech/erc20-token-development)could be unseated, there is little doubt that they are here to stay and will continue to be king and prince .""

""We can be sure that in 2022 they will be the great dominators of the market , so for those who want to have part of their portfolios in these assets, they are projects to follow"", he affirms emphatically. For the rest, Mart√≠nez-Pardo advises ""diversification, be prudent, put on the long lights and assume that large losses can occur.""

MINING RESILIENCE

As for the fundamentals, it focuses on cryptocurrency mining and draws the conclusion that the blackout in Kazakhstan, the world's second-largest mining center, at the beginning of the year ""demonstrates the resilience of the network and the readiness of mining companies."" this sector to adapt and have 'plan B' for these setbacks.""

After, in addition, what happened last year with mining in China, he observes a great resistance in the [development of cryptocurrency ](https://www.blockchainx.tech/crypto-currency-development)sector. ""After worrying news, a few weeks later they recover again"" in a show of the flexibility of the network that the expert highlights as a remarkable fact, ""as well as the ability of the actors who work in it to adapt and move their operations from one jurisdiction to another and from one place to another.

In this sense, Mart√≠nez-Pardo highlights that ""any element that increases the resistance of the block chain will play in favor of the cryptoactive"".

HEDGING AGAINST INFLATION

The co-founder of the investment platform calls to be attentive to the debate on the role of bitcoin as a hedge against inflation, which has been questioned. ‚ÄúMany times it behaves in reverse, like a stock with a very high beta , in which good news improves the outlook for[ cryptocurrencies development](https://www.blockchainx.tech/crypto-currency-development) and negative news, in reverse, lowers the price, when what you would be looking for, originally, is an asset not correlated with the rest of the market"", he reflects.

He invites you to observe this behavior to see if they are really becoming a value with a very high beta instead of being that alternative asset that is sought after.

REGULATION

He also believes that another of the big issues is that of the regulatory efforts of the authorities, especially the steps taken by the US. ""When we have a clearer regulatory framework in this country, surely many institutional investors will decide whether to take additional steps ,"" he argues. ""It is the reference and everything should be welcome,"" he emphasizes, since ""at least for institutional investors, the fact that there is clarity and that these steps are adopted will help greater adoption.""

He does not rule out some kind of negative reaction if the new rules are very restrictive, but in general terms he emphasizes that regulation is a path that will take years, but will bring great benefits to this asset class in the long term.

INCREASED ADOPTION IN COUNTRIES AND ON WALL STREET

Another aspect that has revolutionized the market in 2021 has been the adoption of bitcoin as legal tender in El Salvador . In this regard, Mart√≠nez-Pardo believes that ""if the rally is prolonged and we continue to experience this boom period in the crypto market, we will undoubtedly see more initiatives in this regard by other countries.""

""As we see more turbulence in the markets or in countries where inflation ends up being persistent or may even skyrocket, it will be attractive to follow the example of the Central American country ,"" he continues, ""either by adopting the currency or promoting different initiatives that seek to attract foreign investment"".

As for the 'crypto fever' of Wall Street, explains the co-founder of HeyTrade that ""one has to put oneself in the boots of a director of a company listed in the US, whose duty to shareholders is to maximize the price of that action "". ""If adopting cryptocurrencies and having part of the cash in these assets is going to be well received by shareholders and implies that the share is going to rise, they are practically obliged to look at the sector and deploy initiatives,"" he says.

Therefore, he believes that as long as the rally continues, the interest and momentum of the corporate world of Wall Street will remain alive.

And he leaves, as a climax, a final reflection that invites us to be very attentive: ""If we had had this conversation at the beginning of 2021, we probably would not have hit even one of the news of the year in cryptocurrencies."" Therefore, we must be prepared for everything that may happen.",0,btc,2022-01-17 06:13:29

s6tk7k,yokesh351,10,https://redd.it/s6tk7k,None,Spain: bitcoin is more profitable than buying a flat to rent,"A few hours ago, Business Insider published a report from which it can be deduced that, in Spain, buying bitcoin (BTC) would be more profitable than buying a home as an investment to put it up for rent. This is because the chances of [cryptocurrency development](https://www.blockchainx.tech/crypto-currency-development) revaluing are much higher in less time.

The report points out that **bitcoin is the most profitable financial asset of the last decade** , considering the price increase it has had since then. With a $100 investment in 2010, you would now have $9 million, he says. On the other hand, this time frame may not even have been enough to recover the investment of the purchase of a home.

For example, in the center of Madrid, the average price of a 40 square meter apartment is almost 200,000 euros, according to data from Idealista . Recovering this investment would entail a term of 23 years if it is rented at the average rental price in the area for that size, which is 700 euros per month, according to the platform.

In contrast to this, as CriptoNoticias reported, **buying bitcoin allows you to generate profits in a short time if its price rises** , perhaps even in just minutes or days of trading.

In addition, it does not require an initial investment as large as a home. You can invest as much money as you want in bitcoin, making it accessible to anyone. Above all, in the current context of inflation where saving is more difficult. The study noted that, according to IE University, **15% of Spaniards already have cryptocurrencies**.

## Bitcoin looks better as an investment than a home, but it's high risk

The waiting period to recover the investment in a home is long. However, the advantage of this type of investment is that, once that time frame has passed, the profits can be relatively stable. In contrast to this, **buying bitcoin carries a high risk as it can devalue against the euro due to its price volatility** .

An example of this is the recent price low that hit $40,000 in January from its all-time high of $67,800 last November. Although the upward trend that it has had since its inception 13 years ago suggests that it will continue like this, beyond the fact that past returns are no guarantee of future returns.

An investigation by Visa , among others, reveals that **the growth of bitcoin adoption in the last year, not only at the individual level, but also in companies , will continue to rise** . This promotes the rise in its value, considering that the higher the demand, the higher its price, as analyst Willy Woo pointed out in his predictions about bitcoin for 2022 .

Likewise, Business Insider maintains that this year is also seen as a good time to buy a home. This is due to the current mortgage interest rate, which is negative at -0.5%, according to the policy of the Central Bank of Spain for the economy to recover.",0,btc,2022-01-18 09:27:49
s6uq56,yokesh351,5,https://redd.it/s6uq56,None,Tsunami affected in Tonga receive donations in bitcoin,"The former deputy of the Kingdom of Tonga, Mata'i'ulua 'i Fundamotu, known as Lord Fusitu'a and promoter of a Bitcoin Law for that country, made public the address of a bitcoin (BTC) wallet to receive donations and thus help those affected by the natural disaster that occurred on those oceanic islands.

Last Saturday, January 15, a submarine volcano located in front of the islands that make up Tonga, erupted, **causing waves of more than 1.2 meters** . The event produced floods that affected, among other areas, the city of Nuku'alofa, capital of that nation located in the South Pacific.

Given the magnitude of the tsunami, Twitter user and bitcoiner that Fusitu'a **accept donations in bitcoin** to help the affected population.‚ÄúYou need to set up a bitcoin wallet for Tonga and receive \[donations\] through the Lightning Network. I have learned so much about you and your nation through BTC and Twitter,‚Äù 

After a couple of hours, Fusitu'a responded by leaving the bitcoin address to receive the BTC. So far it can be seen that the address has **received a total of 0.19385171 BTC** , which represents about USD 8,000 at the current market price.

Until now, the seriousness of the damage caused by the tsunami is unknown, largely because the country is cut off from communication. However, the speaker of the Tonga House of Representatives, Lord Fakafanua, said, according to CNN, that **the country requires immediate assistance** in providing its citizens with clean water and food.

Some experts estimate that the scale of the devastation could be immense. There is data indicating that the volcanic eruption was the largest since the 1991 explosion at Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines.

## bitcoin and tonga

As mentioned at the beginning, Tonga is trying to **promote a Bitcoin Law similar to the one in El Salvador** .

Fusitu'a, who is currently the president of the Union of Parliamentarians against Corruption, presented a 5-step plan to bitcoinize that country on January 14,

In addition to the bureaucratic paths that the text must follow to be approved by the different instances, they have also suggested the **potential use of Tonga's geothermal energy** , in the same way that El Salvador does for Bitcoin mining

The event of the volcanic eruption, the tsunami and the donations in BTC, could work as an incentive to accelerate the process that would allow the leading [cryptocurrency develpment ](https://www.blockchainx.tech/crypto-currency-development)to become legal tender in the nation located in Oceania.

## Bitcoin, an option to make donations

Just as Tonga is receiving donations in bitcoin, other international organizations and social organizations have taken advantage of the advantages offered by the Bitcoin network to request donations in support of different humanitarian initiatives.

In that sense, at the beginning of 2021 the American Cancer Society began to receive bitcoin and cryptocurrencies. The intention was to help restart crucial research to find new discoveries and improve treatments.

Barhydt, as a speaker at the North American Bitcoin Conference , gave his vision on the points of agreement between Bitcoin and the metaverses. From their perspective, **they march in the opposite direction to centralization** .

""Anything that goes in that direction is valuable, particularly at this time, when there is a constant and intense struggle for control of people's money and the virtual economy that spreads over the Internet,"" he said during his talk.

The CEO of the Abra exchange is convinced that 2022 will be the year in which **a massive movement takes place regarding the decentralization of organizations and values** , where Bitcoin and the metaverse play an important role.

*‚ÄúIt's going to sound crazy to you, but Bitcoin and the metaverse are the backbone that will help us bypass the global system in order to propel us into the next monetary system where we must create something much better, lifting a lot of people out of poverty. . It seems to me that we have finally found the route that will lead us to a new world.‚Äù*

*Bill Barhydt, CEO of cryptocurrency exchange Abra.*

For Barhydt, a new world will emerge as more people adhere to the decentralization that Bitcoin offers.

*‚ÄúWe can't just wipe out all the trust that the world has in the traditional financial system, but we can see how we've moved towards decentralization and that's really exciting to me. Today we are seeing how decentralized lending and insurance platforms are moving. I think we are going to see big movements even in mortgages in the DeFi (decentralized finance) metaverse.‚Äù*

*Bill Barhydt, CEO of cryptocurrency exchange Abra.*

The executive believes that in a maximum of 15 years, **humanity will no longer be using traditional banks, but that DeFi will take over the scene** . He referred to metaverses as a virtual economy in which all kinds of decentralized finance services exist. In itself, it is Web 3.0, a term that is used to refer to the evolution of the use and interaction of people on the internet and where blockchains are increasingly playing a leading role.

## The world is tokenized and now it belongs to you

Barhydt mentioned how [non-fungible tokens development](https://www.blockchainx.tech/non-fungible-token-development) (NFTs) are contributing to the digitization of items, products or services. For him this tokenization is a sign of how the world is moving towards decentralization.

*‚ÄúNFTs allow us to encapsulate rights digitally and that means we don't need centralized courts of law to prove that something belongs to us, so it's yours, it's just yours and you're free to sell whatever digital property you own. It's very interesting to me that we finally have a way to capture the rights now, whether it's tickets, contracts, deeds or basically a way to capture energy and we don't have to trust anyone to prove that property belongs to us because it will be registered in one of the many networks that exist.*

*Bill Barhydt, CEO of cryptocurrency exchange Abra.*

As a sign of the decentralized financial world that is already capturing people's attention, Barhydt presented the proposal for the Blockchain Gaming Alliance, a global association that encourages the use of blockchains within the gaming industry.

In fact, the Abra platform has incorporated the play to earn model that many games like Axie infinity have. With its utility token, Crypto Perx (CPRX), the exchange rewards its customers by recognizing their loyalty while taking advantage of proposed investment opportunities.

As we have previously reviewed, while the world is getting rid of centralization, **decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO) emerge as a way to govern and make entities work in the digital universe** .

According to my script:

out of 20,000 blocks:

BTC has 53 unique miners.

ETH has 49 unique miners.

BCH has 259 unique miners.

I'm assuming BCH only has more miners because the barrier of entry is a lot lower than BTC / ETH because the hashrate is a lot lower on BCH.

It seems that proof of work is naturally a centralizing force because only a select few can afford mining equipment and the energy costs that come with it.

Proof of Work by its very nature is a centralizing mechanism.

Correct me if I'm wrong.

s7s372,MrComedy325,5,https://redd.it/s7s372,None,Will a Spot Bitcoin ETF Arrive This Year?,"Experts say that 2022 will finally be the year when the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) finally approves of a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF).

Definition: A spot Bitcoin ETF is an investment vehicle that tracks the price of the actual cryptocurrency. It is different than other ETFs that track Bitcoin futures contracts.

History: In 2021, the SEC approved the first Bitcoin futures ETFs. There is now some expectation that the SEC will approve of a spot Bitcoin ETF this year, which would give investors a new option for cryptocurrency.

Stalling: There is concern that the SEC could stall the decision in 2022. At the beginning of January, the SEC once again pushed back its decision on a spot Bitcoin ETF to mid-March. Will the SEC continue to kick the can down the road or will it finally make a decision this year?

Final Thoughts: Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (OTCMKTS: GBTC), a large Bitcoin fund, is trying to convert to a spot Bitcoin ETF this year. This could be an interesting investment vehicle to watch.

‚ÄùRe: ""But hashrate is at an all-time-high, so bitcoin security must be great""

No. Hashrate alone is a misleading metric for btc security.

I mean there are a lot of consumers of legal cannabis in the States but yet somehow still no tokens/coins. However, I did notice this interesting Tangi Token that only finished their first presale and the whitepaper got me even more curious. Their roadmap seems legit and maybe they found the solution. Tangi Token provides a solution for which the cannabis community is in dire need of. Their services would work for both consumers and dispensaries. This way dispensaries would not have to pay abundant amounts of taxes and consumers will also benefit since they have another option to use. Most of these dispensaries of legal cannabis only accept cash as a payment method.

Data: A year ago, Bitcoin made up 70% of the total market cap in crypto. Today, Bitcoin makes up 40% of the total market cap. While it is still the top coin, some investors are looking elsewhere.

Crash: Part of the problem with Bitcoin is that some experts are bearish on the currency, with predictions that the price could drop to $10,000 this year. Of course, there are also bullish predictions of Bitcoin hitting $100,000 this year.

Next Big Coins: Keep an eye on smart contract coins, such as Ethereum, Cardano, and Solana. These currencies represent incredible platforms.

s9gtpb,TheWorldofGood,10,https://redd.it/s9gtpb,ü§î Opinion,Crypto market should break away from BTC for good and stop looking at it for the rise and fall of all crypto,"BTC is an old technology that failed to adapt for its users who need cheaper, faster, and more decentralized way to pay as a currency.

BTC had its moment of rise to 1 trillion dollars market cap and it might possibly go to 3 trillion which is equivalent to top blue chip stock valuations. But it probably will not go 100x like it did previously because that is just an absurd amount of money poured into BTC.

If BTC stops going up, should the entire crypto market stall and wait for BTC to rise again? No, that wouldn‚Äôt make sense because each crypto serves its unique purpose and it should not depend on BTC to rise or fall whatsoever.

It‚Äôs like looking at the IBM stock to see which way stock market will go because IBM is one of the oldest and biggest tech companies. And like BTC, IBM used to be the shining star of all tech companies in the old days until something better came along like Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, etc. Everyone used to think that IBM would be the number one tech company for the future, but surprise! That didn‚Äôt happen because IBM failed to adapt to make new changes for its consumers.

and like IBM, BTC deserves to fall and fall behind better cryptos like BCH and the others. We must not look at BTC anymore to tell which way the market will move.

The blockchain technology and cryptocurrency in itself is bigger and more important than BTC especially if the developers around BTC refuse to make the necessary changes for the users.",10,btc,2022-01-21 18:03:59

Yes you read it correctly Im selling everything. Im selling everything I can find to buy more BCH at these bargain prices.

I subscribe to Baron Rothschild's contrarian way of thing i.e. "" the time to buy is when there's blood in the streets ""; and Baron should know , this bloke made a fortune by buying after the panic that followed the battle of Waterloo with Napoleon.

I've sold the wife's car , she can use mine as I work from home away; Most of her jewelry is also on the chopping block as well as the Gucci bags which are being exchanged for bags of BCH .

I really like BCH, I love the way it works , the speed of the wallet and what BCH stands for in my books 'financial freedom' and 'inclusion'. As Crypto gains adoption I'm expecting the crowd will naturally flock  towards BCH and I'm patient and prepared to wait and continue stashing my bags along the way.

But with repeating all-time lows against Bitcoin and Ethereum people lose their attention and sees Bitcoin Cash as a failure like Vitalik.

[https://tradingview.com/chart/?symbol=ETHUSD%2FBCHUSD](https://tradingview.com/chart/?symbol=ETHUSD%2FBCHUSD)  
[https://tradingview.com/chart/?symbol=BTCUSD%2FBCHUSD](https://tradingview.com/chart/?symbol=BTCUSD%2FBCHUSD)

Ok, some friends at this sub says: Bitcoin Cash works flawless, smartbch promises a lot, bch is used for transactions who cares the price. Price is important for the ones who wants to get rich faster. etc...

I do not agree with those, price is important as hell. Price (with fair distribution of course) is a partial indicator of a coin's adoption, recognition. People defend their ideas with their money.

At that point we have to admit that people do not share the vision of Bitcoin Cash. We need to UNDERSTAND the people. Not criticize. Not celebrate Bitcoin's fall or other coins' falls. 

First of all I haven't sold my BCH's from split in 2017 and buy more at 2018, 2020 and 2021. Hold roughly 100 BCH's. It is more than 90% of my savings. Tell all my friends about Bitcoin Cash. Few of them bought BCH with another cryptos. They told me that I am the only one recommending BCH. They read articles like it was fake Bitcoin (excellent disinformation of Blockstream), untrustworthy chain and said that they do not have any interest of buying things with crypto so they do not interest with low fees, see crypto as an investment. None of them have a hardware wallet. I still recommended them to hold BCH because with mass adoption Bitcoin would fail to meet transaction need. You know ""LN in 18 months"" after all. 100$ fees would push people from Bitcoin. Eventually with high fees at May 2021 people's attraction to BCH was impressive. Unfortunately the attraction depending fail of Bitcoin does not last long.

By the way please stop using the argument that ""we do not hold coins we use it constantly for buying things"". There is a concept called velocity of circulation. You can not use a money without holding it. If you do not hold it, someone else should hold it. If noone holds it then value of money will dramatically lose. All money are good or bad designed to be a store of value. Some are worse store of values, that's all.

So we have to determine the situation. Bitcoin Cash offers a functional Bitcoin to market (with smartbch more than that). But the problem is Bitcoin has a higher brand value and a better distribution (wondering current situation of Bitmain holdings of BCH). So Bitcoin attracts institutional money much more than Bitcoin Cash. And that money provides Bitcoin a stable growth with less volatility. That attracts people and feeds the cycle. On the other hand people do not seek functionality for now. We all know that functionality will eventually be needed. But Bitcoin Cash should be in the game when time come.

By the way some devious people with better insight saw the functionality need and chose to manipulate the market. Trying to create a Bitcoin Cash from Dogecoin is an excellent and profitable idea. Congrats to Elon. In an alternate timeline with his contribution Bitcoin Cash would flip Ethereum and could challenge Bitcoin easily. Imagine a flawlessly working coin, a hard money and the richest man in the world promotes it against a not functioning expensive blockchain offering not to use blockchain.

Anyway Bitcoin Cash needs recognition from the RICH. Not manipulative ones. Some people with insight needs to see the hard money and store of value in one product. I remember Pompliano's interview with Roger. Roger said that Bitcoin Cash has the scaling solution and that would bring the money. Pomp said that maybe the money would bring the scaling solution to Bitcoin. People do not want to lose money so the institutional money would try anything to secure their investment. I do not think lightning is the way but if I had hundreds of millions in Bitcoin, I would pay millions to see a working solution. And generally money solve problems in time. So we have limited time.

Hate the vision of Saylor but Bitcoin Cash needs motivated institutional money like Saylor. Bitcoin Cash is electronic money and a store of value. I see posts criticizing Bitcoin as a store of value. Please stop doing that. Bitcoin Cash is also a store of value and performs far worse than Bitcoin in market fall's. This kind of posts look ridiculous. Don't get me wrong but Bitcoin Cash promotion should be more than ""Bitcoin is bad"".

Bitcoin Cash needs to be accepted in retail. Inflation is there and Bitcoin Cash as a hard money needs to restore trust. International corps like Alibaba, Amazon, Starbucks etc.. Online services. Maybe a professional foundation should be founded and funded for this or powerful individuals should fight for that kind of recognition. Kim Dotcom and Roger are doing remarkable things. But we need more. You could have a perfect product but it won't be enough unless you attract powerful people.

And still can't accept the metrics against Litecoin. Tweets by day, transaction count, marketcap. Bitcoin Cash has to dominate the low fee, proof-of-work coin market.

All I need to say progress starts with acceptance. We have to accept that things has not gone well for 4,5 years. And that's not because of evil Bitcoin maximalists only. Vitalik had a point, two unnecessary forks weakens the Cash concept. But we need to promote Bitcoin Cash to rich and institutions. We can not expect people to find BCH like Paypal.

sbfjg3,yokesh351,11,https://redd.it/sbfjg3,None,What does Microsoft's latest acquisition tell us about Bitcoin and the metaverse?,"Microsoft recently announced a big acquisition. Extraordinary treatment reveals extraordinary vision on the part of the company. What are the true plans of the great technology? What does all this mean for Bitcoin and the metaverse?

**Big Tech fully understands the importance of content in the next evolution of the Internet.** Having consoles and hardware is of little value without quality content. Microsoft publicly announced its plans to buy video game giant Activision Blizzard in a 100% cash deal worth over US$68 billion. A historic deal that reveals Microsoft's priorities right now. ""We need support for many platforms in the metaverse,"" said Satya Nadella, the new CEO of Microsoft. What does this mean? 

There is no reason to think that the authorities will prevent the transaction. After all, Microsoft doesn't have a monopoly on video games. Of course, with this acquisition, the company is ranked number three in the sector by revenue, after Tencent and Sony. The [metaverse](https://www.blockchainx.tech/know-everything-about-blockchain-metaverse) is mentioned. But it is clear that Microsoft's intention, at first, is to feed content from its Game Pass subscription platform. Let's think of a Netflix but for video games. Which means that the user will be able to enjoy video games from the phone and tablet thanks to the cloud. That is, we can do without expensive consoles and sophisticated specialized equipment. Obviously, Microsoft is looking for a Netflix model. 

Everything seems to indicate that Satya Nadella is following the example of Disney's Bob Iger with his latest acquisition. Bob Iger brought Disney back to life with big acquisitions that brought a lot of new and highly franchiseable content to the brand. I am referring, of course, to the acquisitions of Pixar, Marvel, LucasFilms, National Geographic and 21th Century Fox. What does Microsoft gain from this acquisition? Warcraft, Diablo, Overwatch, Call of Duty, and Candy Crush, among others. These are well-known games with a huge fan base. In other words, Microsoft is getting community. Content and subscribers. These names will now add to Microsoft's already quite extensive portfolio. The thing is serious. And I wouldn't be at all surprised by reactions from the competition. 

Now, let's talk about the metaverse. The metaverse needs two things: Content and community. Then the construction begins. And, as the build progresses, new content is created and the community expands. Obviously it is a process. And all in due time. Meta ( Facebook ), Roblox and Microsoft are taking a stand. It is very clear that Big Tech will have a very important role in the construction of the [metaverse](https://www.blockchainx.tech/know-everything-about-blockchain-metaverse). The metaverse, in all likelihood, will be a mixed universe. We will have centralized actors, decentralized actors and hybrid actors. 

On social media, we will surely continue to hear advocates of radical decentralization complain about anything that is not 100% decentralized. However, users continue to adopt solutions in a mixed way. People, in practice, tend to be more moderate and pragmatic than advertised. Social networks unleash radicalism. But, in many cases, it is a rhetorical radicalism. We have to recognize that the Big Tech have a lot of resources to be able to achieve the objectives that are set. The metaverse is coming. And the Big Tech will play a prominent role. 

We must remember that crypto is also a niche. If we only listen to what is said within the niche, with great difficulty, we will be able to see the whole picture. If we limit ourselves to reading only Twitter , we could come to think that there is a revolution out there made up of millions of highly committed militants. The enemies are perfectly marked: Governments , central banks, international banks and multinational corporations. The goal is total decentralization. Which is actually another way of saying ""by the people and for the people"" with the help of technology. 

According to this vision, we have a protagonist and his antagonist. In other words, there is a conflict. A war of the people against the powerful. Which could mean that the success of one is the defeat of the other. That is what is hinted at in the speech. But I'm afraid the reality is very different. Bitcoin and Big Tech do not get along very well at the narrative level. But the market tends to see them as members of the same family. In fact, Big Tech goes up. And Bitcoin goes up. Big Tech low. And Bitcoin goes down. The market, whether we like it or not, puts Bitcoin, Ethereum , NFTs and Big Tech in the same bag. Apparently, everything belongs to the great family of technological innovation. 

Governments, banks and big capitals have expressed their interest in Bitcoin. The same investor who invests in Tech usually ends up investing in Bitcoin and crypto. The investor who is collecting NFTs also plays video games of all kinds. Most people do not separate the product coming from a decentralized system from another coming from a centralized system. Everything is mixed. Because the user, after all, uses what he pleases. 

What is the metaverse? A universe full of opportunities. The metaverse, fintech, NFTs, and Big Tech all correlate positively with Bitcoin. Let's go back to the past and remember for a moment the adoption of Bitcoin by PayPal . How did the Puritans in the country react? Bla bla bla. Private key, custody, Satoshi and the seven dwarfs. Bla bla bla. How did the market react? How did the price react? With gigantic optimism. 

In this space, there is a very large gap between what is said and what is done. My recommendation is to go to the facts and be very skeptical of the rhetoric. Right now, we have a bitcoin dragged down by macroeconomic reality. The market expresses its concern in the face of uncertainty. Ultimately, the US Federal Reserve is the biggest player in all of this. They set the tone and investors follow. Here's the problem. We still do not know for sure what is going to happen with monetary policy. We know there will be cuts. But all the details are still unknown. 

Now, sooner or later, the market will find the clarity it seeks. The waters will return to their course. And investors will return to invest in innovation. Bitcoin is greatly favored with the digitization process. Words more, words less, the fate of Bitcoin is closely linked to the evolution of the Internet. Despite the various opinions, Big Tech and Bitcoin walk hand in hand in this adventure.",0,btc,2022-01-24 06:33:41

sbif3g,groundyouall,22,https://redd.it/sbif3g,ü§î Opinion,"Dominance and Robbery, the money game of btc dominance (keep updating if necessary)","Before any accusation, let's see something really intersting on chart.

[BTCUSDT, 2018](https://preview.redd.it/q9t2ub9jtld81.jpg?width=905&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=cfc92fe0c6c8136f221f0df130e7a27808109654)

First is the big crash in 2018. As you can see, the bitcoin Dominance reached an all-time low around 40% on Jan 6, 2018. And many altcoins reached their peak at this time. Then the market crashed. During the long crypto winter and after, the bitcoin dominance keep rising.

[BTCUSDT, Sep 2021](https://preview.redd.it/epesgjultld81.jpg?width=895&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c3d06c1c4b8bfa095196b1a318e078ad68fbbdf0)

And the recent pullback in September 2021. When the D close to 41%, the price dropped sharply. Then the price rises again with the D. The same pattern also appeared in the pullbacks on Sep 1, 2020 and Nov 23, 2020. I will share charts later, if I have time.

[BTCUSDT, May 2021](https://preview.redd.it/d6r9rdcntld81.jpg?width=899&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fdb7c2cd995f3f14992c3a1f2eb215f22a5fb4d9)

This one is different. In the crash on May 19, 2021, the price and D fell at the same time (bitcoin lose more than altcoins). And here comes the key information: the cause of this crash was China's mining ban, and most of the bitcoin mining used to be in China before that.

&#x200B;

# So now we can know the ugly fact that when the mining industry is directly hit and temporarily loses the energy for market manipulation. Altcoins would not loss so much more market cap than bitcoin in a correction.

&#x200B;

Not long after, right before the September 2021 pullback I mentioned above, most of the chinese price prediction groups on WeChat were full of rumors about ‚Äòwhales selling off‚Äô. It is extremely rare for them to predict such level of correction so accurately. Also, founders of these groups have a well-known good relationship with local mining industry. It's just a Chinese way to make retail investors trigger a long squeeze and spread fear to whole crypto market, resulted in a significant rise of D.

[Shanghai Composite Index](https://preview.redd.it/3qkg4geqtld81.jpg?width=894&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=036894cb40b39050745f54381e3e88b84eea98ed)

I am Chinese and I know lots of Chinese millionaires are obsessed with their money game 'Ââ≤Èü≠Ëèú' and have no vision for the future. It's shown on chart. Chinese retail investors fail to get correct and complete information, they choose to trust unknown people claiming to be experts in various groups on Wechat, 'DYOR' is not popular among them. This makes them extremely vulnerable to massively targeted rumors and eventually become puppets in the crypto market. Turning themselves into tools for increasing price volatility and disrupting long-term value investing opportunities. After the Chinese government cracked down on crypto trading in Dec 2021, Chinese retail investors have significantly decreased. This leads to a weakening of the price relationship between bitcoin and altcoins, which makes the manipulation of D become a little less effective.

sbktvq,Lupin900,36,https://redd.it/sbktvq,None,Just a reminder: BSV is the best 'version' of bitcoin because it's the original.,"Unlike in BTC and in BCH there is no block size limit in BSV (in BCH the limit is set by devs) This makes BSV the only blockchain that is infinitely scalable and will be capable of eventually handling millions of transactions per second.

It's also the most decentralized because the protocol is locked so it's not centrally controlled by a small group of devs like in BTC and BCH.

It's also the only real Proof of Work coin out there because the method of choosing forks in PoW is the ""heaviest chain that follows the rules"". If you have a protocol with changing rules, there is no way of objectively choosing a fork. The correct fork becomes dependent on politics. That is not how Bitcoin works.

I really hope to see more people return to the real Bitcoin. It is in truth much bigger than money. With massive blocks, it becomes possible to record anything on the blockchain for a very low tx fee and that creates real utility. for example, you can store an entire immutable website inside a transaction.

scdc6m,immunebytes,3,https://redd.it/scdc6m,ü§î Opinion,An open letter on bitcoin to Tesla and Elon Musk:,"The Bitcoin Magazine Policy Team invites Tesla and Elon Musk to reconsider their stance on the environmental impact of bitcoin.

1. The Love-Hate Relationship of Tesla and Bitcoin-

In Feb. 2021, Tesla became an industry leader in Bitcoin by accepting payment alongside other renowned names.

May 2021, Tesla stopped accepting Bitcoin with its mission to promote sustainable energy.

Much has been written on the issues of fiat currency, such as assisting organized crime, untraceability, and the environmental impact of its use.

Nonetheless, we still think it would be excessive to ban fiat currency completely. Then, why a double standard appears to exist for bitcoin?

2. Bitcoin and Sustainability-

The available evidence demonstrates that bitcoin actually accelerates sustainable energy adoption.

Research confirms, however, that renewable projects can significantly increase profits by integrating bitcoin mining into their operations.

Because bitcoin can be mined anywhere, anytime, firms can mine bitcoin when grid demand is met and energy prices are low and sell energy when demand is positive.

This allows renewable energy operations to make money when they may otherwise have been unprofitable.

3. Bitcoin‚Äôs Environmental Impact: Needs More Research-

The fundamental question on the environmental impact of bitcoin is a reasonable one that needs further analysis.

We would posit that the operative questions, and ones that have received essentially no research attention, would include:

(a) What is the environmental impact of the overall bitcoin network to operate?

(b) What is the incremental impact of bitcoin transactions?

(c) What is the environmental cost of custody of one‚Äôs bitcoin?

(d) In what ways does bitcoin positively impact the environment?

4. The Proposal-

It is suggested that this research be conducted by those with strong environmental credentials to get to the bottom of the issue with findings that resonate far outside of the existing Bitcoin user base. A robust methodology should be developed to analyze this topic, build in public, develop a research coalition with strong environmental bonafide. All Bitcoin users should know the carbon dioxide impact of their use and be able to transact with vendors such as Tesla. They should know the carbon dioxide impact of using dollars, too.  


5. t‚Äôs a bit ironic that #Tesla is so concerned about #Bitcoin‚Äôs energy sources.   
According to the best available research, Bitcoin‚Äôs energy mix is already around 56% renewable, compared to around 20% for the average American‚Äôs power consumption. 

Since over 80% of Tesla charging is done at home, does that mean Teslas should be put on hold until the energy people use to charge them is more than 50% renewable? We hope not.",0,btc,2022-01-25 13:08:21

Is this the new pro-BTC talking point? If so, it is extraordinarily foolish -- so foolish, in fact, that it presents a golden opportunity for BCH to seize the high ground in that analogy.

Unfortunately, their attempt is mostly failure. We have all heard about their congestion and network problems. Their technology is simply not as advanced as Bitcoin.

On the [STN](https://bitcoinscaling.io/) \-  **Scaling Test Network,** The bitcoin protocol has achieved [3,953 TPS inside a block](https://stn.whatsonchain.com/block-height/5999). That's **2,371,890** transactions! On the Mainnet the maximum is more modest: [1,119 TPS](https://whatsonchain.com/block-height/686127) which is still very fast.

The important thing to remember is that there is no real scaling limit with Bitcoin. Unlike with inferior technology such as ""Solana"", there is no network coordination required for processing each transaction. Instead, Miners process all transactions locally into a block and then send out the whole thing as a batch once they find a solution. Miners don't even need to send all the data, they can just send the order of transactions and what's missing. Bitcoin is very well designed and scalable and can reach millions of TPS. Nothing else even comes close.

The fake forks of Bitcoin have created a lot of misinformation about Bitcoin's capabilities. Just like how communism ruins the economy and stifles growth, Centralized dev coins create slow and broken blockchains that are incapable of being used in the real world. Bitcoin is NOT a centralized dev coin, It is a ***unilateral contract*** issued by Satoshi. No one has the right to change the contract and continue calling it ""Bitcoin"".

sd77yf,sylsau,23,https://redd.it/sd77yf,ü§î Opinion,The IMF's behavior towards El Salvador only further justifies the very existence and absolute necessity of Bitcoin for the world,"El Salvador is a sovereign country that has the full right to choose how it wants to act to build a better future for its people.

Nayib Bukele chose Bitcoin to try to change the future of his country. Under the current system, El Salvador was condemned to survive by begging for aid from the IMF or the World Bank.

Nayib Bukele understood the why of Bitcoin and decided to seize this opportunity to change the future of El Salvador and its people. The people of El Salvador overwhelmingly support Nayib Bukele in what he is trying to do for the country.

El Salvador's bold choice has already changed the way the country is seen around the world. Everyone is talking about El Salvador and more and more entrepreneurs will be coming to El Salvador to participate in this experiment of building the first Bitcoin Nation.

Who knew where El Salvador was before Nayib Bukele made this choice? Very few people. No one was talking about El Salvador. Bitcoin is already a game-changer for El Salvador and this is clearly just the beginning.

While the IMF or the World Bank scoffed at Bitcoin a few years ago, now these institutions are getting scared by the growing possibility that the Bitcoin experiment will succeed in El Salvador and motivate other countries to follow Nayib Bukele's path.

Tonga is talking about adopting Bitcoin by the end of 2022, as are other countries in South and Central America. In short, something is happening and the IMF feels the danger mounting for its obsolete system.

Rather than letting the people determine for themselves, the IMF is threatening El Salvador saying the country must abandon Bitcoin. The IMF's threats only justify, in my opinion, the very existence of Bitcoin and the absolute necessity for the world to have this alternative system available.

Since El Salvador will logically refuse to obey the IMF, what's next? Will America eventually orchestrate a coup in El Salvador to overthrow the government and end the Bitcoin experiment? How far are the powerful people in the current system willing to go to prevent countries from expressing their free will in monetary and financial matters?

El Salvador must continue to resist outside pressure, and other countries that will join the Bitcoin adventure in 2022 must do the same. The world is changing, and the first countries to adopt Bitcoin will be the ones to benefit the most in the future.",17,btc,2022-01-26 14:29:18

And of course the more casual stuff - ""hey a group of us are going to hang out at this beach bar on this afternoon/evening to have drinks and watch the sun go down""

There could be a marketing campaign to spread awareness about the meetup, with the big names in the space talking it up.

This would also bring some extra tourist revenue to the businesses there that have shown their support of bitcoin cash AND give a lot of people the opportunity to use BCH in genuine point-of-sale transactions for possibly the first time.

And who knows, if it turns out to be totally awesome, it could become an annual event that moves around the world to whichever community is the latest new hotspot for native Bitcoin Cash adoption.

I recently started investing in cryptocurrency last January 24, 2022. Sorry if this post is kinda long, I tend to lose my focus when writing and just blabber a lot. It has only been a few days. I researched about this kind of investment before putting a small amount from my saved allowance (I started with more or less 50$) which is already considered big in my country. I divided it into three, a portion in Bitcoin, a portion in Ethereum and the remaining in something called Chainlink, I can't see any big changes yet because it is still going down with everything and just waiting for it to bounce back. I am from the Philippines by the way and coins.ph is the app that I use as a crypto wallet.

So yeah, I saw bitcoin cash and the price is different from bitcoin. I am planning to invest my incoming 20$ in this.

I just want to ask some suggestions from people who have been in this field for a long time. Am I doing the right thing in investing with different types of currencies?",35,btc,2022-01-27 10:25:25

This was back in the times when the internet was at an infant stage and all such scams were still conducted with old fashioned documents. And when cleaning out some old stuff, I discovered that for some reason, I have actually kept the official papers from this pyramid organization for some 30 years.

So I thought it would be interesting to dust off the old scam and explain just how it worked in detail, and then see how that compares to bitcoin, which is often also accused of being a pyramid scheme:

sej8ba,yokesh351,4,https://redd.it/sej8ba,None,Around El Salvador in 45 days: A travel story with only Bitcoin,"Here are some travel tips from a couple who traveled around El Salvador for 45 days using only Bitcoin.

El Salvador adopted Bitcoin ( BTC ) as legal tender more than four months ago, on September 7, 2021. Bitcoiners around the world have been watching closely as El Salvador's President Nayib Bukele attempts to ""convert"" to an entire nation.

The president regularly buys every drop, has promised a low-tax Bitcoin ‚Äúcitadel‚Äù in the form of Bitcoin City , and is exploring mining BTC with renewable energy using volcanoes.

But, what is the day-to-day life of those who live in the smallest country in Central America, known as ""the land of volcanoes""? Moreover, what is it like to try to live only on Bitcoin?

An Italian couple, Rikki and Laura, have succeeded. Rikki is a Bitcoin podcaster and human rights activist, active in the space since 2016. Laura works as a community manager in the blockchain space and has been focused on crypto since 2019.

After the approval of the Bitcoin Law, Laura had the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãtraveling throughout El Salvador for 45 days. The challenge? Live only with Bitcoin. No bartering, no euros, and of course no US dollars.

Their experiences offer a fascinating insight into the country's history, its enchanting landscapes, and, of course, its future with Bitcoin. His travel accounts can be read in English and Italian, and his podcast is called *Bitcoin Italy Podcast* . 

On the other hand, Rikki and Laura have also encountered significant challenges from just using BTC, such as gaps in education and difficulties transacting with Bitcoin. On January 24, they spoke with Cointelegraph via video call from Santa Ana, a coffee-rich region of El Salvador.

They are now authentic sources of knowledge for bitcoiners who want to try a BTC-only trip to El Salvador. Here are his top tips for crypto enthusiasts traveling to the small tropical nation.

**Do you accept Bitcoin? No? Bye!**

In San Salvador, many places accept Bitcoin, from McDonald's to Starbucks to mom-and-pop stores. In El Zonte, known as ""Bitcoin Beach"", the birthplace of the Bitcoin Law, most vendors advertise that they accept BTC. However, off the beaten track, Bitcoin is little known and is sometimes confused with the state-sponsored wallet, Chivo Wallet . 

When faced with a seller who does not accept Bitcoin, the pair's main advice is to conduct a theatrical experiment. The customer must ask the seller if they accept Bitcoin, and if the seller says no, the customer must turn on their heel and walk away. They should not take the money.

As Rikki explained, ""you just have to go!"" Traders want the business, so if a customer makes a scene showing they only have Bitcoin, the seller will want to accept their sats.

If a seller doesn't want to accept Bitcoin, it's usually not due to infrastructure shortfalls, since ""you can buy a cheap Chinese smartphone on the market with a sim card and a data plan for $20, and the connection here is huge."" It is the ""perfect country to carry out the Bitcoin experiment"".

This brings us to the interesting part, which is getting to the ‚Äúwhy‚Äù, the reason behind not accepting Bitcoin. Sometimes it is simply because the owner of the restaurant or hotel has confused Chivo with Bitcoin, it is more common than you think. Other times, a quick chat and a few taps on Chivo are enough for them to see how it works.

Rikki and Laura had a blast discussing and educating the locals about Bitcoin, making great memories along the way.

**Prepare and re-prepare**

Although the adventure was a lot of fun, Rikki said, ""It's not easy, and it takes a bit of preparation. You have to plan your routes in advance. Especially when you get away from the main tourist areas, where bitcoin is less accepted."" In some cases, the couple called 20 or 30 hotels before finding a bitcoiner.

Undeterred by the challenge, these fights were, in his opinion, the cream in the pot of his traveling adventure. ""Sometimes we ended up in the craziest places just because we were looking for places that accept Bitcoin."" They joke that Satoshi Nakamoto was the driving force behind his daily decision making.

Traveling solo with Bitcoin also meant that the pair were forced to engage with the locals on a more intimate level, making human connections along the way.

**Sorry Satoshi, but museums don't accept Bitcoin**

Rikki really wanted to see the Mayan ruins of Tazumal, a historical site and archaeological museum near Santa Ana. However, the heritage sites only accept cash. Rikki was crestfallen and, given the opportunity, would question President Bukele about such a strange omission of Bitcoin. ""Why are the museums managed by the Salvadoran Ministry of Culture only cash?"".

The decision may change as the Bitcoin Law slowly rolls out to affect all walks of society, but currently, cultural experiences, museums and some excursions are cash only. The couple couldn't get into those sites due to their strict rules. Bitcoin farmers should carry a few bucks just in case.

**Education, education, education**

Few Salvadorans understand what Bitcoin is, how it works, or the difference between Lightning Network and on-chain transactions. As Laura points out, some Salvadorans ""think that you can only pay in Bitcoin if you use the Chivo app."" They are unaware of other Lightning wallets like BlueWallet or Wallet of Satoshi.

In the Chivo app itself, there are no teaching tools for users who want to learn about Bitcoin. Rikki explained that ""nobody here knows anything about Bitcoin. They didn't provide a second of education to the people of El Salvador."" Laura added: ""If people had learned about Bitcoin, they wouldn't be using the app.""

Given the lack of information and education of Salvadorans, it is therefore the responsibility of Bitcoiner tourists to take their time with the locals. They must share their knowledge about Bitcoin and be patient while Salvadorans begin to understand the monetary network.

As Michael Saylor often says , it takes thousands of hours to understand Bitcoin. The Bitcoin Law was quickly passed and implemented, and many locals have not had the time to understand the technology.

**""Come to El Salvador and spend your Bitcoin here""**

This is not so much advice as a plea from Rikki and Laura on behalf of the Bitcoin community in El Salvador.

Come to El Salvador, and spend your Bitcoin. This increases awareness, broadens education levels through network effects and word of mouth, and ultimately encourages more and more people to use the Bitcoin network, they said.

For Rikki, ""the more you trade, the more you learn. The more you learn, the more you study, and use it for good.""

This coin is not to be confused with the famous ‚ÄúBitcoin‚Äù with a sticker (BTC). Some people call BTC a Bitcoin ‚ÄúCore‚Äù to distinguish it from Bitcoin Cash. A word of caution, though, that you should not send (BTC) Bitcoin to a (BCH) Bitcoin Cash wallet, or vice versa, because the two coins are not interoperable and you will lose your coin if you confuse the two.

There are many theories and propagandas against Bitcoin Cash (BCH), and this post is not about the politics surrounding it. This post is about how BCH is closer to the original intention of Satoshi Nakamoto, the Bitcoin creator, and how it is the most ideal cryptocurrency in the world. You may have negative feelings about BCH but let‚Äôs put aside our own feelings for a minute and examine how BCH can be the world‚Äôs best cryptocurrency.

Reason #1: Bitcoin Cash transaction is very fast and secure.

Let‚Äôs look at the functionality of Bitcoin Cash. Its transactions are instantaneous and can be completed within 2 seconds or less, because it uses a technology called, zero-knowledge proof, which allows a transaction to be confirmed merely by announcing it. The transactions are not only fast but also secure and immutable, meaning that you cannot cancel it, deny it, hide it, or interfere with it in any shape or form. Put it simply, Bitcoin Cash is as useful as Visa and any other money transaction forms and technologies out there. Bitcoin Cash is the perfect cryptocurrency for any merchants and customers for its speed and security.

Reason #2: Bitcoin Cash is very easy to use for anyone with a smartphone.

Bitcoin Cash not only looks good on paper but it is very easy to use in real life. I would recommend anyone who‚Äôs reading this post to download an app, Bitcoin.com wallet, on your phone and start experimenting with it by sending Bitcoin Cash from and to your Bitcoin.com wallet. The transactions happen within 2 seconds or less, and the user interface is very easy to navigate and use for anyone who might not be familiar with how cryptocurrencies work. If Bitcoin Cash is to be used by merchants and customers as a daily currency, it would work fast, secure, and reliable 100 percent of the time, without a fail.

Reason #3: Bitcoin Cash transaction fee is virtually zero (incredibly cheap)

It costs only a fraction of one cent to send Bitcoin Cash and the fee is virtually unnoticeable as opposed to other popular cryptocurrencies. According to thebetterbitcoin.org, Bitcoin Cash transaction fee is about $0.00007 to transfer $10 on its layer one blockchain. To give you a better perspective, Bitcoin (BTC) charges about $0.48 fee for the same amount (source 1).

Reason #4: Bitcoin Cash is incorruptible and indestructible, which makes it the most secure cryptocurrency in existence.

Bitcoin Cash has no one leader or company that is in charge of how it runs, and it cannot be corrupted or destroyed by anyone or any group. It is a perfectly decentralized coin that is used by global community and users who ensure that Bitcoin Cash or its operations cannot be interfered by any group, company, or government. If you want a secure coin, Bitcoin Cash is it.

Reason #5: Bitcoin Cash is already being used by thousands of merchants worldwide and its trading volume is 4.3 billion dollars as of January, 2022.

According to Bitcoin.com, there were 4,300 merchants worldwide in 2021 that accept Bitcoin Cash (BCH) and the numbers are still growing (source 2). There have been growing adoptions in St. Kitts and Nevis in 2022 also (source 3). Its trading volumes on all exchanges are $4.3 billion as of 01/30/2022 according to Coinmarketcap.com. This makes the volume/market cap ratio 0.77 (4.3 billion dollar volume / 5.6 billion dollar market cap) (source 4). You can also look at the Bitcoin Cash adoption map at https://map.bitcoin.com. These numbers all point to one fact that Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is among the most used cryptocurrencies and is used as it was intended as a daily currency by Satoshi Nakamoto.

Conclusion: If a cryptocurrency is to be used as a global currency by average people around the world, Bitcoin Cash (BCH) would make a perfect currency based on all of these facts. I know that there are prejudices against Bitcoin Cash amongst the crypto investors, especially the BTC maximalists. But if we set aside our differences and look at the bigger picture of what can be accomplished by adopting Bitcoin Cash as a currency, I believe the dream of Satoshi Nakamoto will be realized where the people of the world can have true financial independence and ownership that can‚Äôt be taken away or destroyed by any one government, dictator, or external organizations.

shd5ao,wattumofficial,19,https://redd.it/shd5ao,None,Why Russia is unlikely to ban Crypto,"The Russian Central Bank has been making headlines over the last few days with reports of a possible nationwide ban on cryptocurrency and crypto mining. 

These reports come as a result of the Director of Financial Stability Elizaveta Danilova‚Äôs call to ban crypto. The central bank has since released a 37-page report outlining the reasoning behind this proposal. 

Politics are local, laws are national, and currency/value is international, and therein lies the inherent problem with the outlined proposal. 

The Report in a Nutshell 

A key criticism within the report was the market volatility of cryptocurrencies, highlighted on page 23. However, in this context the central bank fails to address activities such as gambling or stocks with the same level of scrutiny. This is the common underlying theme throughout the document, along with several other key points with similar shortcomings. The report paints crypto as one of the main destabilizing threats to the Russian economy, while loosely aided by the idea that people would invest all of their hard-earned money into Bitcoin, a high-risk asset. While the report goes into further detail, no projections or supporting documents were provided to validate such claims. 

The report goes on to mention that Bitcoin and crypto transactions in general are often used for illicit activities, on page 27. However, the reality is that any form of monetary transaction can be used for such purposes. In fact, it was recorded that in 2021,¬†only 0.15%¬†of crypto transactions were used for illicit purposes. This contradicts the claim that crypto undermines monetary policy, not to mention that it doesn‚Äôt align with Russia‚Äôs civil code, which recognizes crypto mining as a form of entrepreneurship. 

Additionally, the report raised concerns associated with crypto mining‚Äôs high energy consumption and its negative effect on the environment. This point is heavily used throughout the report as a backbone for reinforcing its stance on the crypto ban, while entirely ignoring the possibilities of exploring green and renewable energy solutions that could be researched and funded by Russia‚Äôs crypto mining industry. 

The report also seemingly throws around various claims, such as that 0.1% of all miners control over 50% of the Bitcoin mining industry in the country (page 23) without citing any credible sources for such information, and failing to acknowledge that some of the biggest miners in the country are publicly traded companies. There are a plethora of other false statements as well, including that stablecoins are not backed by anything and aren‚Äôt regulated (page 24), when in reality stablecoins like Circle USDC are fully regulated and legally redeemable. 

What is the goal of the ban? 

The proposed ban has no intent to ban crypto outright. ""We note that we do not suggest that holding cryptocurrencies by citizens be banned,"" Danilova stated according to TASS, Russia's state media, adding that there are fraud risks, as well as difficulties in asserting rights when acquiring cryptocurrency on foreign crypto exchanges. 

What the ban is targeting instead is to prohibit the issuance of tokens, crypto mining, trading activity that uses the country‚Äôs existing financial infrastructure, and prohibiting institutional investors from investing in crypto. 

Russia is currently the world‚Äôs third biggest crypto miner by hashrate, just behind the US and Kazakhstan. As mentioned earlier, crypto mining is defined and officially recognized by its civil code, and has immense potential for stimulating a significant economic growth for the nation, should it be embraced. 

Panic Amidst Misunderstanding 

To make matters worse, a number of sources have contributed to the spinning of this story by saying that Russia is banning crypto, including an¬†article by Forbes¬†that incorrectly states (and spells) that ‚ÄúRussian¬†is the third nation to¬†crackdown¬†on cryptocurrencies over the last year, following China and Kazakhstan.‚Äù The Forbes commentary isn‚Äôt true, and while Kazakhstan did face nationwide power disruptions, it in fact did not crack down on mining and crypto and, as of today, neither has Russia. 

What does it boil down to? 

While the report by the Russian Central Bank‚Äôs head of financial stability is 37 pages long, it in itself is just a proposal based on one‚Äôs fears and assumptions fueled by misinformation around issues that either do not exist or are not likely to happen. 

For such reasons, it is highly unlikely that the Russian government will take Elizaveta Danilova‚Äôs proposal seriously, as it simply lacks solutions and fails to outline any concrete next steps, not to mention that it would put the country on a backward trajectory seeing as Russia has just legalized cryptocurrencies in 2020. If such a ban were to go forward, it would reverse this legislation (which took nearly 10 years to pass), not to mention that it would take several years to implement. 

Such a decision would be counterintuitive, especially in light of recent calls by the US and its allies¬†to disconnect Russia from SWIFT¬†in the event of its invasion of Ukraine. The hypothetical situation has received widespread media coverage, and Russia‚Äôs exclusion from the international payment system would have catastrophic effects on its economy. This would in turn push Russia into mass crypto adoption. Should such events take place, it is highly unlikely that Russia would want to transact in CBDC (China‚Äôs digital currency) or the Yuan, and would instead have to rely on Bitcoin to transact with the world. 

It is likely that the Russian government understands that it would be far more beneficial to tax the mining industry rather than ban it. Such taxation would present opportunities for infrastructure expansions and reinvestments into green and renewable energy sources. Taxation could also come in the form of utility, or the licensing of mining facilities to use a Russian sponsored mining pool that would implement a tax in real time, further reinforcing the potential for significant economic growth. 

It seems that such potential is not far from being actioned on by the Russian government, with the Russian director for financial policy, Ivan Chebeskov,¬†supporting the regulation of crypto¬†as opposed to banning it. Chebeskov‚Äôs sentiment comes as a response to the central bank‚Äôs proposal, further indicating the unlikelihood of an outright ban. He further¬†outlines: ‚ÄúWe need to give these technologies the opportunity to develop. In this regard, the Ministry of Finance is actively involved in the development of legislative initiatives in terms of regulating this market.‚Äù According to Chebeskov, the ministry has prepared its own proposal, this one for the regulation of crypto and digital assets, and is awaiting feedback from the government. 

Industry Experts Weigh In 

‚ÄúThe Bank of Russia¬†conducts its activities independently¬†from other federal bodies of state power, regional authorities and local governments‚Äù, meaning they do not have a final say in local government activity and would have a hard time banning utility companies from providing power to mining operations. 

Across the entire report, crypto mining in particular is mentioned only a handful of times and within the context of energy consumption. On page 4 of the report, a brief summary of mining is provided and then swiftly dismissed as a threat to the economy: ‚ÄúIn this regard, according to the Bank of Russia, the best solution is to introduce these prohibitions on the mining of crypto-currencies.‚Äù No actionable solutions are provided, and the statement is followed by a summary of the Bank of Russia‚Äôs plan to develop their own digital currency. 

Roman Zabuga, PR director of mining hosting provider BitRiver,¬†called the probability¬†of an industry-wide ban ‚Äúnegligible‚Äù. 

A Widespread Misunderstanding 

While the call for a ban on crypto mining sounds daunting, it is important to note that this is currently no more than a proposal on behalf of the Bank of Russia, which would need to be approved by the government first. Such decisions are usually time consuming and initial proposals are often adjusted through compromise, or rejected altogether. 

Recent events in the industry have showcased a general lack of understanding for cryptocurrencies and mining on behalf of government bodies and other institutional leaders, as seen with Russia‚Äôs Central Bank. 

A recent House¬†hearing¬†on energy in crypto mining is another example, prompting Grant McCarty of Bitcoin Magazine to reiterate that¬†Congress doesn‚Äôt yet hate Bitcoin:¬†‚ÄúThis hearing didn‚Äôt signal malice on the part of Congress; it signaled a lack of education. These people just don‚Äôt know enough about Bitcoin to have that strong of an opinion yet [.]‚Äù 

In Conclusion 

The Russian Central Bank‚Äôs proposed ban is unlikely to pass as it clearly demonstrates the need for a better understanding of crypto within government bodies in order to allow for the technological advancements and economic spurts that are made possible by this developing industry. As a result, the proposal‚Äôs lack of credible sources and solutions stems from general fear, uncertainty, and doubt. 

The proposal has also prompted a swift response on behalf of Russia‚Äôs Ministry of Finance calling for proper regulation of crypto and digital assets, not a ban. President Putin has also briefly addressed this issue during a conference meeting on January 26, saying that Russia does in fact have a competitive advantage in crypto mining due to a ‚Äúsurplus of electricity and the well-trained personnel available in the country,‚Äù further adding to the improbability of a ban on crypto.

shnmbl,yokesh351,10,https://redd.it/shnmbl,None,Facebook and Instagram company releases patents related to Bitcoin,"Meta, formerly Facebook, has joined the board of the Cryptocurrency Open Patent Alliance (COPA). This group encourages the adoption and free use of technologies related to Bitcoin (BTC) and cryptocurrencies.

To be part of COPA, the company led by Mark Zuckerberg, promised not to sue anyone for their patents related to [cryptocurrencies development](https://www.blockchainx.tech/crypto-currency-development). The only exception will be ""defensive reasons.""

The intention is that the patents ""be effectively and freely available for all to use,"" the organization said in a statement today, January 31.

From the Alliance, the arrival of Meta to its board of directors is considered to ‚Äúsolidify‚Äù its position as a ‚Äúleading cryptocurrency patent‚Äù association. According to COPA, they are building a ""collaborative environment"" focused on open source to ""protect core technologies for all users.""

*Meta's leadership in COPA underscores the importance of protecting open source technologies. Companies large and small can foster innovation by collaborating on critical infrastructure.*

*COPA statement.*

COPA was founded in September 2021 , by former Twitter CEO and fervent bitcoiner, Jack Dorsey, as Crypto news reported .

Another goal of the alliance is to keep Bitcoin as open as possible and prevent innovative technologies from being blocked through patents.

Any company working in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãcryptocurrencies, regardless of whether or not they have registered patents, will be eligible to join the alliance . The organization is made up of more than 20 companies in the cryptocurrency sector such as Coinbase, Kraken, OKCoin, MicroStrategy and ARK Invest, among others.

## Meta and the sale of Diem

The integration of Meta to COPA is not the only recent movement that the company has made in relation to [cryptocurrencies development](https://www.blockchainx.tech/crypto-currency-development). Apparently the company is studying the possible sale of the assets of Asociaci√≥n Diem , of which it controls a third. The objective would be to return the capital to its investor members .

Diem's ‚Äã‚Äãtop executives are reportedly in talks with investment bankers to find a way to sell the project's intellectual property, according to people familiar with the matter.

It is worth remembering that Diem, formerly called Libra, intended to enter the stable cryptocurrency business, but the project failed to materialize as a result of the pressure they received from various countries.

However, the possible sale of Diem does not stop Meta's efforts to continue trying to enter the cryptocurrency industry in one way or another. Although not creating a cryptocurrency, they would do so with a digital wallet.

On January 28, CriptoNoticias reported that Meta filed a registration request in Brazil to launch a wallet with support for bitcoin. The company must wait 90 days to find out if the permit was approved or denied by the Brazilian authorities.",0,btc,2022-02-01 05:56:04
sho2bq,yokesh351,11,https://redd.it/sho2bq,None,Google search for the word ‚Äúbitcoin‚Äù is at a 6-month high," The interest in bitcoin (BTC) has increased in the last 6 months, surpassing in this month of January the moment in which the[ cryptocurrency development](https://www.blockchainx.tech/crypto-currency-development) reached its last historical maximum of USD 68,000 in November 2021.

According to the scale shown by the Google Trends website, it can be seen that bitcoin reached an average of 51 points on a 100 scale today, January 31. This rebound **was achieved for the first time since June 2021** , when it reached 52 points.

It is worth remembering that Google Trends is a **tool that shows the most popular search terms of** the recent past.

In this sense, they use a scale of interest over time that goes from 0 to 100, where 0 is a sign that the word is not being searched for, while 100 represents that it enjoys the greatest popularity among engine users. Search.

As mentioned at the beginning, the word ‚Äúbitcoin‚Äù **was not as searched in November 2021** , when the [cryptocurrency development](https://www.blockchainx.tech/crypto-currency-development) reached an all-time high of USD 68,000, a fact reported by CriptoNoticias.

It should be noted that this January there were two peaks, **specifically on January 22 and 24** , which correspond to the fall in price last week. This indicates that interest may be growing at the moment, perhaps due to investors' desire for details on the causes of the drop and future forecasts.

t can be interpreted that bitcoin arouses the interest of the public, even though it currently has a price of USD 37,000, which represents a drop of 45% compared to the highest price achieved last year.

## The word ‚Äúbitcoin‚Äù in El Salvador

Google's tool, in addition to showing the popularity of words in its search engine, also reflects interest in countries.

In this case, **El Salvador is at the top of the list of nations that most search for ‚Äúbitcoin‚Äù** , with an average of 100/100.

This is undoubtedly driven by the adoption of the cryptocurrency in the Central American country as legal tender and the controversy that has been generated in that country around BTC. Decision that put that nation and its president, Nayib Bukele, at the center of debates around the world.

Until now, the measure has encouraged more people, especially bitcoiners, to become interested in what is happening in El Salvador. The transcendental measure is such that the couple of American journalists Max Keizer and Stacy Herbert, strong defenders of cryptocurrency, plan to nationalize and stay in that country for a long time .

The other side of the coin is represented by international financial organizations that have criticized the adoption of bitcoin, one of them has been the International Monetary Fund (IMF).

The IMF recently said that **the arrival of bitcoin in El Salvador** ‚ÄØ ""involves serious risks to financial and market integrity, financial stability, and consumer protection.""

The IMF's position joins that of the US risk rating agency, Moody's. An analyst from this company warned that the risks for El Salvador would increase if the government continues to buy more bitcoin.",0,btc,2022-02-01 06:21:19
sho5wh,HammondXX,27,https://redd.it/sho5wh,‚ùì Question ,Selling a bunch of things from my indie studio on CL and FB Marketplace because of hard times. Tips for a BCH success?,"Hey Gang,

&#x200B;

 I am looking to join the fray and spread the good word. 

I am dumping a lot of gear after laying off most people.  Are there any tips for using BCH on Craigslist or FB Market place? 

I was also thinking of doing somethings on Hardware swap on reddit. 

I am looking on tips and success stories. 

I know how to get apps and such. 

I am not asking for handouts or basic getting started info.

&#x200B;

You guys are all awesome Thx!

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Background:

My studio fell on some hard times after our debut game release. We went rounds with our distributor over fraud concerns and when we asked for an audit they banned us. Essentially blocking the biggest path to market.

Our other product was VR for Healthcare and everything got put on hold over covid (vendor moratorium). The beta was tabled. :(

 So I have been mining Eth on all the studio computers and day trading. 

I am  selling of our unused gear and doing what I can to raise funds to hire / rebuild and port our game out to a crypto based VR game (gamefi). 

Our investors pulled out because of their own Covid issues and now.... I am starting over 

I am even kicking the tires on making a decentralized defi concept because distributors are ruthless with game studios and film makers. 

&#x200B;

There is also no enterprise CDN (content delivery network) for game content out there so Healthcare and companies cant buy game content. I think there might be a huge play here 

&#x200B;

WE were trying to bring games into healthcare to help kids with immunocompromised issues and families who are stuck inpatient. 

&#x200B;

So i'm raising seed capital again and giving it another go.  :)

If anyone knows of a legal way to raise capital with crypto I would love to hear it as well. 

If anyone has input or advice i would love to hear it

&#x200B;

Keep spreading the love and fighting the good fight peeps",3,btc,2022-02-01 06:27:05

sht2vw,powellquesne,145,https://redd.it/sht2vw,‚ùì Question ,WHO originally turned you on to Bitcoin Cash?,"I am not asking 'when' -- that is what people usually ask because they are obsessed with being perceived to have gotten involved 'early' which is something I find to be not very relevant. You can say when you got involved if you wish, but what I am asking is **who convinced you** to take BCH seriously? And for bonus points, how did they achieve this?

My answer is Roger Ver: I had already heard of Bitcoin Cash but when I saw by his tweets that he took it seriously, I decided to look into it seriously too, and I liked what I saw. The reason Roger's recommendation influenced me to do more research is that I perceived him as a philosophically motivated figure who truly understands the value of Bitcoin and who was in it mainly for its ability to resist censorship, and I felt it was unlikely that he would be acting as a kneejerk victim of FOMO. I auto-discount the claims or predictions of anyone I think is falling victim to FOMO and therefore desperate to jump aboard any trend that demonstrates short-term price gains, because such people will invariably lie their asses off about the value of their investments, so the fact that Roger's public image, at least (I don't know the man), sailed far above chasing the latest outlier gains on every damn thing, was key in persuading me to give Bitcoin Cash a closer look.

What's your story?

EDIT as of 11:40 AM PST: Few people here seem willing to answer this question straightforwardly, so I haven't been able gather many useful data points thus far.

sihf8y,yokesh351,11,https://redd.it/sihf8y,None,"Bitcoin is ""a superior form of money"" and ""many of its risks have disappeared""","Fidelity experts believe some investors are overestimating the dangers of 'crypto'

The way in which traditional investors approach bitcoin is not the most appropriate, in the opinion of the experts at Fidelity, since they tend to treat bitcoin in the same way as any other technology investment. These experts point out that, however, the first advance of bitcoin ""was not as a superior payment technology, but as a superior form of money "", since as a monetary good ""bitcoin is unique"" .

Thus, the experts of this investment firm that is in the race to launch bitcoin exchange-traded funds in the US, maintain in their report 'Bitcoin First', that ""bitcoin must be considered, first of all, to understand digital assets , and then separately from all the other digital assets that have come after."" ""Investors working on their understanding of the digital asset ecosystem and creating a framework for considering investing in the space will likely benefit from segmenting bitcoin and everyone else ,"" they explain, suggesting treating ""investments in digital assets as decisions."" separated"".

This simplifies the portfolio construction process and allows allocators to make two simultaneous but distinct decisions. On the one hand, ""the importance of maintaining exposure to the scarcest monetary asset in this category of emerging digital assets (bitcoin)"", while, on the other, "" the potential for exposure to innovation and experimentation in course within the ecosystem outside of bitcoin (the rest of 'altcoins').""

Given the increased competition and potential failure paths for many of these projects, ""allocation to non-bitcoin tokens is often done with a venture capital-like mindset ,"" say experts at the bitcoin giant. asset Management. Instead of choosing a specific project, ""investors tend to take small positions in many individual names."" ‚ÄúThis often leads to a search for an active management solution to deal with the overall increase in complexity,‚Äù they continue, something that ‚Äúshows a stark contrast to a simple bitcoin-only approach in this digital asset space.‚Äù

OVERESTIMATING THE RISKS OF BITCOIN

As for the place of these assets in a traditional investment portfolio, investors must first sort out the key risk and return factors of their respective investment thesis. As for bitcoin, ""first-come advantage has led to a lack of true competition in its primary use as a monetary asset and store of value, and creates a drastically different return profile for investors in the Satoshi coin."" Nakamoto"", indicate from Fidelity.

As for the risks intrinsic to this asset, which were previously used as reasons to talk about its disappearance, ""many have disappeared and every day the network is strengthened with more users, miners and infrastructure ,"" they say. And they argue that almost all the setbacks that bitcoin continues to have today can also be seen in any other digital asset, ""with nation-state attacks and protocol failures being two of the most notable risks of the network.""

One of the great dangers for this ecosystem is the possibility that large countries oppose its growth, as has happened in China . The geopolitical landscape to date has made proper regulation seem much more likely than outlawing. In any case, ""Bitcoin is better positioned to defend against coordinated attacks due to its prioritization of decentralization.""

As for bugs in the network itself, bitcoin ""is the protocol least likely to find a major bug at this stage in its life, given that it's been around longer than any other project, it has intentionally simplistic code and it has a reward of 1 billion dollars for anyone who is able to exploit it,"" they analyze from Fidelity.

Of course, they clarify that ""it is not that we think that an allocation to bitcoin is free of problems, but rather that we believe that some investors are overestimating the downside risks of bitcoin compared to other digital assets.""

In conclusion, ‚Äúthe bumps bitcoin faces today seem minor compared to other digital assets, given the lack of code complexity and emphasis on decentralization.‚Äù ""The little or no competition in its main use case and the 13 years of operation as a store of value contribute to reinforcing the idea that bitcoin will become an exchange currency,"" they insist by way of conclusion.

sivdt7,Hobakk225156,1,https://redd.it/sivdt7,None,WallStreetBets: Yesterday‚Äôs Meme or Here to Stay?,"WallStreetBets opened up markets to a new generation of DIY traders, and the meme stock investing craze was born. A year later, is the community still trading with the same vigor?

&#x200B;

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/cvenracdmgf81.png?width=1201&format=png&auto=webp&s=45f543eb2448f53a1640749e12ef4814d6ab7248)

In January 2021, DIY trading seized headlines around the world after popular subreddit WallStreetBets (WSB) rallied interest in failing company GameStop. A short squeeze was initiated, word traveled rapidly over social media and GameStop‚Äôs share price [soared](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-25/how-wallstreetbets-pushed-gamestop-shares-to-the-moon) from $37 to $483 in just a week.

While some have dismissed WSB‚Äîand meme stocks in general‚Äîas a passing fad, new research from Capital.com has found that trading volumes linked to WSB meme stocks did not decrease over the course of 2021 and remained strong in the second half of the year. Entertainment company AMC is a notable example of a meme stock that‚Äîdespite a fall in WSB mentions earlier in the year‚Äîrecorded a surge in trading volume, peaking at 766 million shares in June 2021. 

David Jones, Chief Market Strategist at Capital.com, is not surprised by this sustained interest and says the appeal of meme stocks like GameStop is hard to ignore for newcomers to financial markets. Although the GameStop story came and went months ago, people want to hang on to the possibility it may happen again, he argues.

‚ÄúPeople think, ‚ÄòGameStop moved 1,000% in January, so it‚Äôll do that again,‚Äô but clearly it hasn‚Äôt,‚Äù Jones says. ‚ÄúThe research we have done is interesting and shows that unless you are in really early, on day one when it starts moving, you are likely to lose money on meme stocks.‚Äù 

**Blink-and-miss-it returns**   
Meme stock trading favors those who buy into these companies early; Capital.com data shows that investing in a stock the same day it becomes popular on WSB is statistically the best time to invest in it. On average, buying the stock one day after the hype will give the highest day-trading return of 0.9%. After this, losses typically worsen, from 0.2% the next day to ‚Äì2.2% seven days afterwards. But when the big winners, AMC and GME, are disregarded, short- and long-term returns are, on average, negative. This demonstrates the gamble of WSB; most people will lose, even when joining the game quite early on.

This timing is a key part of meme stock trading, which relies on social media chatter to stimulate interest and share price movement.

Michael Haupt, who moderated WSB from 2019 to 2020, says the subreddit targets traders with a short-term mindset.

CFDs (contracts for differences) are often used to invest in meme stocks. ‚ÄúI balk at even calling it investment,‚Äù says Haupt. ""Really, it is a short-term gamble. You‚Äôre buying short-term contracts that expire within a week, so either the contract expires in the money, or it expires out of the money.‚Äù

The heightened risk of meme stocks and CFDs undoubtedly deters some investors, but the former financial adviser says the element of danger is part of the appeal, and that for many, there is ‚Äúno honor‚Äù in being a long-term investor.

For Haupt, WSB is less about a measured approach to risk and more about appealing to those interested in the glamor and thrill of trading. ‚ÄúThe ethos of WSB has always been right in line with what it took to get rich in our country, which is that it takes a risk,‚Äù he says.

He believes this risk will continue to result in many people losing their money. ‚ÄúBut the people who make it big are the ones that we point to because they provide an example of somebody who escaped and made it good. It gives us hope that we can all make money,‚Äù he says.

 **The reality of trading**  

Capital.com‚Äôs data lays bare the riskiness of meme stock trading, showing that investment in 105 WSB stocks generated positive returns in only 50% of cases after three days, while just 34% of these gave positive returns after three months.

Jones describes these returns as ‚Äúdreadful‚Äù and points out that traders would be better off if they had instead spent their money on an ETF that tracked the index. He is also concerned that WSB has changed people‚Äôs perceptions of typical stock market behavior.

‚ÄúIf you are new to investing, and you see something like GameStop, it gives you a completely skewed view of what investing is about,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt think that unless you‚Äôre making a 10-fold return on a stock, you are not doing a good job‚Äîand appreciate that if you are gunning for higher-level returns, risk goes hand in hand with that.‚Äù

The reality of the stock market‚Äîand the rarity of 10-fold share price rallies in just a few days‚Äîis not well understood by many DIY traders. As Jones points out, the allure of overnight success stories and quick wins will always attract newcomers to the markets.

Discussing stocks online is not a new concept, but WSB users‚Äô ability to rapidly share information via Reddit and Twitter, thus mobilizing large-scale investment moves, has signified a change.

Despite the risks, Jones believes that a repeat of the market movements of January 2021 could happen. ‚ÄúThe phenomenon of people getting really excited about stocks and talking about them on social platforms is not going to change,‚Äù he says.",0,btc,2022-02-02 18:05:57

siylko,wattumofficial,5,https://redd.it/siylko,üì∞ News,How the Belt and Road Initiative can end USD dominance and create a parabolic rise in BTC adoption,"China‚Äôs Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) was first launched in 2013 by President Xi Jinping as a¬†massive infrastructure development project¬†extending from Europe to East Asia. The initiative, which has garnered the support of over 60 countries worldwide, is anticipated to significantly empower China‚Äôs economic and political influence. 

Referred to as the ‚ÄúNew Silk Road‚Äù, which rose during the Han Dynasty (206 BCE - 220 CE) and wove trade networks through what is now Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and Afghanistan, among others, the BRI roadmap includes the creation of railway networks, energy pipelines, highways, and streamlined border crossings. The original Silk Road made Central Asia one of the first epicenters of globalization, and the BRI has similar ambitions. 

What are the global implications of the BRI? 

As more countries sign on to various aspects of the BRI initiative, Syria has taken up a spot in line as well. Syria represented the first failed US intervention attempt as fellow BRI country Russia stepped in. Since Russia‚Äôs invited intervention in 2015, the Syrian government was able to take back control of nearly all of its territory from ISIS, pushing US military forces aside and negating their efforts. Should the US continue facing restricted ability to intervene abroad, its political influence would subside significantly as a direct parallel with its military presence. 

Military force isn‚Äôt the only way the BRI disrupts US dominance. The initiative can further affect dominance by ceasing USD transactions between BRI member states. In this scenario, member states would need an alternative to USD, which would most likely be a form of cryptocurrency. As such, cryptocurrency can mean that it can easily be converted to Bitcoin, using it to transact globally and in turn trigger a mass adoption of BTC. Bitcoin would thus become the de facto true global currency, even while not endowed by any one country. 

With Syria, Russia, and China united under the umbrella of the BRI, and many more nations showing interest in the initiative, the US can anticipate a decrease in influence and intervention ability which would reduce its stature greatly.

This ‚ÄúNew Silk Road‚Äù, and thus new wave of globalization, has the potential to align with the opportunities presented by Bitcoin‚Äôs own transcension of borders, transaction speed, and swift adoption rate, propelling the digital coin to be regarded as a natural substitution for USD, as far as the global stage is concerned. 

The collapse of US dollar dominance has become a common topic of discussion, with many musing that USD could lose its status as a world reserve currency. It‚Äôs been noted that the US dollar‚Äôs status as such has been¬†declining for years, with or without the influence of cryptocurrencies. 

On the other hand, bilateral trade volume between two of the main BRI member states, Russia and China, has been steadily increasing, seeing a 31% spike in 2020 alone and exceeding $140 billion in 2021. If this volume were to be transacted in BTC instead of USD, it would most certainly propel its adoption and influence to new heights. 

How does the New Silk Road lead to Bitcoin? 

Should such a scenario unfold, and if you believe in the possibility that countries united under the BRI would edge out the US, you should think about investing in Bitcoin. Even better than investing, you should consider mining for yourself. 

If you were to buy 1 Bitcoin today, you would own 1 Bitcoin. Three years from now, whether the price of Bitcoin goes up or down, you would still own 1 Bitcoin. With mining, you will eventually get a return on your initial investment, and by that point, it becomes a passive income while it continues to mine more Bitcoins. In the end, you end up with multiple Bitcoins while your initial investment amount stays the same. 

In addition to providing passive income, Bitcoin mining hardware holds residual value that, should you sell it, would allow you to make back a portion of your initial investment. Selling your hardware also allows for an easy upgrade path to the latest units. This is the equivalent to a new iPhone model coming out; the latest model becomes available, and you can choose to sell your old one for the new version while the amount you can attain for your model remains attractive. Mining hardware is further classified as computer equipment; the IRS outlines that computer equipment is¬†tax depreciable. 

Becoming a Global Currency 

As the Belt and Road Initiative portfolio of supporters continues to grow, it is more crucial than ever for the US to remain a world reserve currency. However, expansion of the BRI initiative will make it harder to maintain this status. 

The US dollar also relies on exclusive use of the dollar by American citizens; adoption rates of Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies have soared¬†over 880%¬†in the last year, with¬†more than 40 million Americans owning a share of Bitcoin. 

Through mobile Bitcoin mining solutions, inflation hedge prospects, and a steep surge in users and investors, Bitcoin offers flexibility and autonomy that together pave the way to financial empowerment for citizens worldwide.

Not only using the currency, not only speculate (look forward), but it is the
decision that holding coins will be the bulk of your monetary holding, only
spending or sell some to replenish your low national currency balance needed
for the near future.

There are some hard core hodlers, who want to stash sats for their bare
lives, selling the apartment, the car, and avoid starting a family, and even delay
consumption below a level that most people think is necessary and still prudent.

A fun fact is that the son of famous Peter Schiff, Spencer, turns out to
be a hodler. I heard a discussion between father and son, but in this
episode of Peter Schiff's sound blog, he describes what his son thinks and he is
definitely a hodler after my definition above.

sjpoip,coinriot,19,https://redd.it/sjpoip,None,The HackSmart hackathon flipstarter campaign has unfortunately been cancelled for now.,"We've made the hard decision to cancel our HackSmart hackathon Flipstarter. The price has dropped over 30% since we launched the Flipstarter campaign and realistically it just made the budget unviable for the project. We had hoped the price would stabilise somewhere higher by this point but with it so close to the funding goal and with just a couple of days left we couldn't let it get funded and lock in an unviable budget.

We have set ourselves the rule that we will only host events that live up to our high standard and unfortunately that standard was at risk in the current project.

We will perhaps try to relaunch the project bigger and better at a later date in the year and hopefully find someone willing to be a counter-party to some kind of financial hedge so this issue doesn't occur again next time. Or maybe there'll be a stablecoin crowdfunding tool on SmartBCH by then.

We are extremely grateful to everyone for supporting our project. It's quite likely it would have been fully funded. This really shows that the BCH community is there, ready support projects that bring value to the ecosystem. This is a very strong sign for the BCH and SmartBCH community.

Anyone who pledged to the project can now moves their funds as they wish. If anyone has any issues with this please let us know and we make sure it gets sorted.

skneoi,Gatenka,5,https://redd.it/skneoi,ü§î Opinion,A short story in using crypto from this side of the world (and why I love BCH more now),"So, a friend and I had this experience about 6 hours ago. Sorry in advance for the descent into madness. TL;DR at bottom of this post.
___

Said friend asked me to help with his first crypto purchase as the vendor he was looking to buy from somewhere in Europe only accepted EUR/GBP fiat, and BTC/ETH/Cardano. He settled on Cardano to pay for, because it turned out to be the cheapest option. I foolishly agreed to walk him through the process. We immediately ran into 3 problems:

1. We're from Malaysia, so it's not exactly a country where crypto comes cheap (literally a 4:1 exchange rate). Using a credit card would've incurred an additional 8% surcharge for both fiat and crypto payments.

2. Almost everywhere we looked up didn't allow us to withdraw Cardano, only to trade. We [weren't allowed to pay for it](https://imgur.com/a/OmjVSfI) even. Thought it was a browser issue, so we tried multiple browsers, same result.

3. Because of the purchase attempts being in EUR/USD, we kept on having to play a guessing game of ""how much is enough"" with our foreign exchange rates before the volatile price of Cardano jumped or dipped.
___

We spent well over 3 hours trying to figure out how to buy Cardano just to pay a European vendor for one measly item. Yes, I know it was dumb. I have no excuse except that we had invested too many brain cells in figuring out how to do something that would've been easier if we just sucked it up and paid with a credit card from the very beginning.

The upshot of the whole mess was when we discovered Coingate [allowing us to exchange BCH for ADA](https://imgur.com/a/zOEA7qU).

Finally!

I simply loaded up my Bitcoin.com wallet, scanned the QR code, and [paid for the ADA](https://imgur.com/a/QyAXns6) within two minutes. It took another 2 hours for Coingate to confirm the payment and release the Cardano we bought. And now, here I sit, with mental fatigue and a bruised ego, but with a satisfied friend who now owes me $121 and dinner.

I also cursed out loud that all of this could've been easily solved if the vendor simply accepted BCH too.
___

TL;DR:
Friend wanted to buy an item with Cardano, I helped. We both suffered through the process.

Time spent trying to buy ADA: 3+2 hours

Time spent paying for the ADA with BCH (with confirmation): 2 minutes

Ego: bruised but intact

Brain cells lost: too many

TL;DR: we're working on marrying Group with PMv3 and figuring out how to introduce PMv3 features in a backwards-compatible way (meaning not breaking non-node/node-dependent software when updating node software) that would give us the best of both worlds: flexibility of Script and convenience of P2PKH tokens.

It's looking good, lots of potential for May 2023, Group would give us native P2PKH tokens + a ""N+1"" contract inductive proving tool, taking proofs out of `groupID`, and PMv3 would give us a ""N-1"" proving tool taking proofs out of `TXID`. They could be used independently or they could be used together to create more efficient contracts that'd be easy on the users (send to this P2SH address, get a P2PKH token representing your stake in the contract, etc.)",26,btc,2022-02-04 20:56:52

Since there is a cap of 21 million coins, making them artificially cheap will enable retail BCH supporters to move a disproportionately large percentage of the existing supply into SmartBCH. So BCH builds out its defi ecosystem, shorting the coin will only dry up the supply more quickly.

The Canadian Freedom Convoy is a peaceful protest of truckers and citizens speaking out against mandates and the government's heavy handed approach to curbing the spread of covid. Many feel these measures have unreasonably infringed upon Canadians' rights as guaranteed in the Canadian Charter of Rights & Freedom.

$10 million was raised through GoFundMe in support of the protesters, the 2nd largest amount ever raised on the platform for a Canadian cause.

**Today at the request of the government GoFundMe has announced it is refusing to release the funds to the organizers and will instead distribute it to charities of its own choosing. This is a clear case of government and corporate censorship of money.**

Bitcoin Cash and Flipstarter provides a censorship resistant way of raising money. No government or corporation can censor, freeze, or confiscate the donations made.

All funds raised will be distributed to Freedom Convoy organizers.

**Who am I and why do I care?**

I'm Andrew, a fully doxxed Canadian veteran who opposes government overreach and believes in Bitcoin Cash and crypto in general as a way to increase the economic freedom of all individuals. I've been involved with cryptocurrency since 2013 and have worked at [Bitcoin.com](https://Bitcoin.com) as Head of Design since 2018 helping to fulfill that mission.

I'm not very active here but some of you know me well.

In an exclusive television interview with Fox Business on Wednesday, JMP Securities director of fintech research Devin Ryan spoke candidly about a number of topics within the[ development of cryptocurrency](https://www.blockchainx.tech/crypto-currency-development) industry. Among them, macroscopic regulation amid looming expectations of a White House policy framework, states within the United States accepting Bitcoin as legal tender, as well as the vast potential for consumer adoption in the near future. anus.

Crypto assets have seen significant volatility in the past month, with top asset Bitcoin falling nearly 44% from its all-time highs and Ethereum posting a similar decline.

Despite the price drawbacks, capital investment, consumer adoption, community optimism, and company valuations for the digital asset space have never been higher, what is seen reflected in the recent multi-million dollar valuations of Animoca Brands , Fireblocks and FTX , of $5bn, $8bn and $32bn, respectively.

Regarding the supply of coins within the market, Ryan stated that ""a lot of them we don't think really have a future, but some of them really have use cases to help solve problems in the world with Blockchain technology.""

Additionally, he cited the potential of crypto mechanisms being integrated into the gaming space, assessing that ""people can monetize their time in ways never seen before."" He also stated that [development of cryptocurrencies](https://www.blockchainx.tech/crypto-currency-development) are ‚Äúthe new frontier‚Äù and went on to predict that the overall growth of the sector will be preceded by short-term volatility as these technologies compete for mass adoption.

In response to a question about efforts by Miami and New York to create a statewide digital asset, in addition to Arizona and Wyoming pursuing various methods of adopting Bitcoin, Ryan stated that there is ""tremendous innovation and capital formation."" , and that states and countries will be willing to become technology-enhancing venues.",0,btc,2022-02-05 05:45:16

sljks9,Mallardshead,34,https://redd.it/sljks9,None,"BCH: I'm going to skip the long, difficult, and organic step of storing and absorbing the world's value. I'll just leapfrog into being a transactional currency and the world will love me! ü§°","Oh? Is that why your price has collapsed 80% in 5 years? Is that why you've fallen from #3 in mkt cap to #24 behind gaming tokens, celebrity shitcoins, and memes? It's been some humble pie for longterm and shorterm holders alike. Greed and ignorance.

[craftsmanship is not subjective](https://preview.redd.it/413qdezsj3g81.jpg?width=1500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b46e9b25aea6d5b885ed83be6e2ef78d5dc608f0)

For bitcoin (the real version), volatility won't flatten enough until the law of diminishing returns makes 25% annual moves large moves, which means it'll have absorbed an incredible amount of the world's value, and that information assymetry is gone, that many securities are settled in bitcoin, and that it's the Schelling Point of reserve assets. This will take at least 3 more halvings where whole bitcoins are no longer a thing, where there's no longer a whole bitcoin issued per block reward. Where we don't express bitcoin like .03445672 but with satcomma's .03,225,672

Instead of wanting to do this incredibly difficult work, BCH decided (in conjunction with Coinbase and VC's) to expand the block size and appease mainstream talking points and the ignorant beliefs of the uninformed, that bitcoin was ""too slow"" and if this was fixed, it would magically become a transactional currency--as if the world was anywhere close to ready for that. They failed to realize this would over time eliminate the ability for average people to run nodes, and damage mining dynamics irreparably. They forgot the critical importance of information scarcity on layer 1, which is bitcoin's biggest advantage. They forgot that wether it's a human body, tree, physics, or pizza, everything gets built in layers. They decided they could somehow combine the utility of stablecoins and value absorption of bitcoin into one shitcoin, and since they already had the name confusion with bitcoin, proselytizing it to unaware people would come easy. The thoughtless gamble backfired. Shortly after, they suffered a predictable 51% attack, not enough independent nodes have ever gotten spun up, and its price over time has drifted lower and lower, and its value absorption has slid further down the mkt cap hierarchy. While BCH struggles to transact $5000 a minute on average, Bitcoin transacts $40,000,000.

It wasn't too long ago the other mainstream talking point was getting passed around here like a sailor's wife: ""The Lightning Network won't scale! It's a scam!"" Unfortunately since then, it's continued its parabolic growth, CashApp completely integrated it, Starbucks began setting up their own LN nodes, LN apps became some of the most downloaded mobile apps, AlphaPoint re-worked the Chivo wallet where the nation state of El Salvador uses the L2 network heavily and adopted  bitcoin as legal tender, much to the anger of BCH, Vitalik Buterin, and most recently, the IMF.

If you‚Äôre looking to venture into crypto investing you should take note of the next few lines.  This is because over the next couple of paragraphs we would be highlighting some of the most common crypto scams and how avoid them. 


Crypto Ponzi Schemes: Ponzi scams generally trick victims into investing in an essentially a nonexistent project. 
Fake apps and exchanges: another way that investors get scammed is developing fake apps and non-existent exchanges. When these apps are downloaded they give the scammers access to the victims private data like funicular information. 
Pump and dump schemes : Here, scammers encourage investors to buy crypto assets in dubious crypto projects, based on false information. The price of the cryptocurrency subsequently rises and the scammer sells his own shares, earning a handsome profit and leaving the victim with worthless coins.
Fake celebrity endorsements: in this scam, celebrity social media handles are hacked or faked. The scammers the use these accounts to post good reviews about fake crypto currencies. 

The easy way to avoid the aforementioned scams is to leverage of vetting crypto platforms like the RiseUp ecosystem. These platforms leverage on technology to get smart contracts,

 crypto holders etc. Some of them also offer research insight to the investments enabling the investors to be well educated and informed about the true nature of crypto projects. Anyways, I am open to your thoughts and opinions about it.""",0,btc,2022-02-06 20:08:48

If you‚Äôre looking to venture into crypto investing you should take note of the next few lines.  This is because over the next couple of paragraphs we would be highlighting some of the most common crypto scams and how avoid them. 


Crypto Ponzi Schemes: Ponzi scams generally trick victims into investing in a n essentially a nonexistent project. 
Fake apps and exchanges: another way that investors get scammed is developing fake apps and non-existent exchanges. When these apps are downloaded they give the scammers access to the victims private data like funicular information. 
Pump and dump schemes : Here, scammers encourage investors to buy crypto assets in dubious crypto projects, based on false information. The price of the cryptocurrency subsequently rises and the scammer sells his own shares, earning a handsome profit and leaving the victim with worthless coins.
Fake celebrity endorsements: in this scam, celebrity social media handles are hacked or faked. The scammers the use these accounts to post good reviews about fake crypto currencies. 

The easy way to avoid the aforementioned scams is to leverage of vetting crypto platforms like the RiseUp ecosystem. 

These platforms leverage on technology to get smart contracts, crypto holders etc. 
Some of them also offer research insight to the investments enabling the investors to be well educated and informed about the true nature of crypto projects. """,0,btc,2022-02-07 01:52:28

From finance, the internet, to sports betting there has been significant transformation brought about by the adoption of the decentralized system of blockchain. The future is indeed DeFi. Financing has never been easier and more accessible. This is greatly illustrated in DeFi Microlending. To those unfamiliar with the term, it essentially means access to microloans by small entrepreneurs and SMEs on a blockchain ecosystem. In traditional microlending, the workflow is as thus, a microlending website collects funds from investors and funnels them to a borrower through a microlender accessible in the borrower's location. Essentially, access to loans is location sensitive. However, with DeFi microlending, borrowers from anywhere can access microlenders from anywhere. Once more, blockchain is highlighted in its transformational glory. 
Some reputable platforma offer DeFi microlending services. A good mention here is  SUKU DeFi ecosystem which leverages on algorithmic, autonomous interest rate protocol combined with SMS and Whatsapp-based tools to give these participants access to open financial applications.""",0,btc,2022-02-07 02:04:55

snf9o6,bit_surfer011,10,https://redd.it/snf9o6,None,Three reasons why you cannot change the protocol,"I like many of you once believed that the Bitcoin protocol is something that can change or ""evolve"" over time. But I have since learned, that by its very nature, the Bitcoin protocol cannot change its core design without destroying itself. Here is why:

# (1) It centralizes the protocol

The Bitcoin protocol and its native token '*bitcoins*' are one and the same. The minute we have some small group of developers who can push changes into the protocol, they control the money and its functionality.

A protocol that has a developer group is by definition centralized. When a small group decides on the rules, they get to define what the money is. This is because the Bitcoin protocol follows the longest chain that abides by the rules. When devs can decide on rules, they decide on the ""correct"" chain, and thus, on the ""correctness"" of everyone's money.

I know some may argue that it is not developers that decide but the community as a whole. Such a view is unfortunately extremely naive. It is not how society functions. All human organizations in history form hierarchies. The is no such thing as a community where all members have equal say and power to shape the rules. Hierarchies always form and there is a concentration of power at the top.

This is true even for democracies today. But the situation gets 100X worse when we are talking about internet communities where people are anonymous and multiple accounts can be made and discussions can be moderated and censored. The idea of  ""community consensus"" is a myth sold to the naive. The truth is, the top floor of the social hierarchy decides the rules.

# (2) It brakes the security

Bitcoins security is based on Proof-of-Work. The way this works is that nodes follow the *heaviest chain that follows the rules*. This provides the system with an objective definition of which chain tracks the ownership. The only way to attack and create confusion in the system is to compute a competing longer chain which is very difficult and expensive.

Once we take a position that the rules are ""changeable"", we no longer have an objective definition of the rules. Instead, we end up with politics and personal opinions deciding what the ""correct"" rules are.

This means that the: ""*heaviest chain that follows the rules*"" is now subjective and open for debate because the *rules themselves* are open for debate. The protocol inevitably splits into multiple chains each with its own political claim for correctness.

With multiple forks tracking the ownership and no objective way of determining the correct chain. We no longer have a protocol that tracks *bitcoins*. Instead, we get multiple private forks with their own private tokens and their own definitions. The original system and its native tokens are destroyed. Nothing is real. We are left with nothing but mere ""opinions"" and that is not a good thing for a money system.

&#x200B;

>It should go without saying that a system whose entire security and *incentive structure* is based on its design cannot possibly be expected to remain secure if the design itself is then allowed to arbitrarily change by politics and future trends.  
>  
>Each change can alter the incentives in an unpredictable way which can then lead to further future changes that could eventually doom the entire system.

# (3) It turns the bitcoins from a 'commodity' into a ""private currency""

What many fail to understand about bitcoin is that it is a *commodity currency*. To be more precise, it can be called an 'explicit' or a 'defined' commodity currency. This is because it is a system of money based on an economic resource that follows a certain definition.

**The definition is:**

*The ownership ledger embodies proofs of costly computation that follow specifically defined rules of the Bitcoin protocol.*

Unlike traditional commodity currencies based on precious metals where each unit embodies the resource in itself. The bitcoins are an 'explicit' commodity where the derivative of the resource (i.e. Proof of Work) is embodied in the ledger system that tracks the individual tokens.

Once we change the rules, we are no longer tracking the original commodity. It is the equivalent of having a gold-based money system and then moving to copper while claiming it is the same thing. It's not.

With changing rules, we lose any objective definition of what we are tracking and we end up with ""private currency"" or ""contractual currency"" which simply means that a group of people get together and decide to keep track of an *imagined* or *subjectively agreed on* currency.

The problem with such a system is that since all human organizations form hierarchies, the subjective opinions of those at the top will always be worth more than those at the bottom. Inevitably, *private money* always leads to extreme contractions of power. Eventually, it is either shut down by the government or it *becomes* the government. ""private money"" does not work.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

In my opinion, Bitcoin is way ahead of its time. The concept of ""decentralization"" is something most struggle to understand. It's like introducing democracy to peasants in the Feudal Age. They probably wouldn't understand and even try to defend the system they are familiar with.

The same is true today. People are so used to living and using systems that are controllable by a small group of leaders that they cannot imagine anything different. When given a free system such as Bitcoin, instead of embracing its objective, locked, and leaderless nature, they alter it into a system that resembles our current democracies where there is some group at the top that can control and make changes to the system. A system that is subjective, political, and a concentrator of power.

Decentralization means: *A* *protocol that is not controlled and is not reasonably likely to be controlled, or unilaterally changed, by any single person, group of persons, or entities under common control.*

I see many who seem to mistakenly believe that ""decentralization"" is when they are the ones in control or the people who share their ideology can make changes. That is not decentralization! that's just you in power. Decentralization is when nobody can make changes. Not other people and not YOU.

I hope this helps people understand Bitcoin better. There is still a lot of work to do to clean up all the lies and confusion surrounding Bitcoin and its system. With time, more people will understand.",0,btc,2022-02-08 08:26:14

Last year I started building a pool with the intention of building a small community around it, and adding more coins later down the line, so it's all fully scalable already, we can spin up new coins easily.

I recently added some chat rooms and will be adding a shop later accepting only crypto.

We started with a small coin as between a few of us we have enough hash to produce lots of blocks, but with crypto down now, barely anything is worth mining, somehow we have still managed to maintain most of the hashrate on the pool, I think mostly as we have included ourselves in a ""one click miner"" and also things like Hive OS. But now I'm thinking of adding more coins and expanding.

Adding a coin like BTC or BCH is very daunting, we will have to rent a lot of hash to start with, then market the pool heavily, while it is finding blocks already..  ***can this be pulled off in 2022?***

so5ghc,yokesh351,1,https://redd.it/so5ghc,None,My house for a bitcoin: cryptocurrencies make their way into Spanish real estate,"The Tiko *marketplace* already accepts digital currencies in its transactions while experts point out that the incorporation into the demand of the younger generations will boost the [development of cryptocurrencies](https://www.blockchainx.tech/crypto-currency-development) and the tokenization of real estate in the country's real estate sector.  

Cryptocurrencies are gaining ground as currency in the Spanish real estate sector. In fact, in the face of repeated accusations of a bubble, pronounced fluctuations in value and warnings from regulatory bodies about their advertising strategy in the media, companies that are betting on cryptocurrencies as the current currency in Spanish *real estate* are making their way with the aim of **promote the use of digital currencies in operations of sale, rental or investment in real estate assets** .

The home buying and selling *marketplace* Tiko recently announced that it **was accepting cryptocurrencies as a valid form of payment** in its operations. The platform thus became the first Spanish iBuyer to accept digital currencies as a form of payment in its transactions.

The decision of the company, which **accepts all kinds of cryptocurrencies** , from bitcoins or ethereums to neo's or iota's, responds to a ""philosophy of greater flexibility and comfort for buyers"", according to Ana Villanueva, CEO of Tiko for Spain and Portugal , to AxisPrime.

Regarding the daily fluctuations in value that [development of cryptocurrencies](https://www.blockchainx.tech/crypto-currency-development) usually experience, the company explains that **the value of the property is always expressed in euros** on its platform and acknowledges that ‚Äúit is very likely that at the time of the down payment and at the time of the purchase and sale the exchange rate is different‚Äù.

To prevent fluctuations from affecting any of the parties, **Tiko makes two conversions** , one at the time of the deposit and the other at the time of the transaction, ‚Äúso that the price of the purchase is never affected by its volatility‚Äù , underlines Villanueva.

Tiko performs two conversions, one at the time of deposit and one at sale, to avoid the impact of fluctuations 

The example of Tiko illustrates a change in the conception of the use of cryptocurrencies, which can begin to get rid of the label of an essentially speculative product, to gradually gain **more weight as a currency in the market for real estate transactions** . 

This paradigm shift can only go further, as Gustavo Adolfo L√≥pez, director of operations of the API Catalonia group and co-author of the book *Proptech Revolution* , points out to Eje Prime. L√≥pez **focuses on generational change and the green light from regulatory entities** , such as the European Central Bank (ECB), so that the use of digital currencies is consolidated in the Spanish real estate market.

""The younger generations are used to the use of cryptocurrencies, therefore, it is they and the administrations, when they promote their digital currencies, for example, the digital euro, who will convert cryptocurrencies into currencies of current use"", indicates L√≥pez, who underlines that the use of cryptocurrencies to pay the amount of a real estate sale in Spain ‚Äúis absolutely legal‚Äù.

In addition, L√≥pez points to **other opportunities generated by the use of cryptocurrencies, such as the** ***tokenization*** **of assets** , a practice that pursues the division through shares in the transaction of a property in the digital sphere. ""We could convert a real estate asset into a financial asset, with a return and being able to sell the participation (token) at any time,"" concludes the expert.

The 'tokenization' of assets consists of the division of investment in shares of a property in the digital field

Precisely, this type of operation is what the Spanish proptech Reental is developing *,* which **bases its business on the acquisition of real estate and then divides the investment through tokens** , which it markets at a minimum price of one hundred euros, offering a return higher than eleven%.

The investor only has to register in the *start up* and have a *wallet* , a cryptocurrency bank account, in which they will **store the investments in tokens that they want to undertake within the platform** .

""We are the leading company in Europe in real estate *tokenization* , our platform already has more than 5,000 registered users and we have more than 500 investors from fifty countries,"" Eric S√°nchez, co-founder and CEO of Reental, told Eje Prime. ‚ÄúIt is a very liquid investment and we distribute monthly dividends; the demand is spectacular, the tokens last a few hours before the investors get the total number of shares‚Äù, highlights the manager.",0,btc,2022-02-09 05:16:28

This is a radical change in the attitude of the Russian authorities regarding this type of currency, since last December the head of the Central Bank of Russia, Elvira Nabiulina, spoke out against the use of the Russian financial system in operations with cryptocurrencies. . The regulatory entity explained its rejection due to the high volatility of these currencies and their frequent use in illegal transactions. However, Russia currently does not prohibit the possession and use of this type of currency in transactions, which must be carried out through exchanges authorized for this type of exchange operations. The upcoming rule provides that transactions exceeding 600,000 rubles ($8,016) must be declared and those who carry out illegal transactions with cryptocurrencies through alternative channels will be fined.

Bitcoin Cash is a forked shitcoin that has lost 80% of its value in 5 years. It has fallen from #3 in market cap to #27 behind celebrity shitcoins, gaming tokens, and memes. Its adherents decided to fork from bitcoin (not backwards compatible) and leapfrog the long, difficult, and organic step of absorbing the world's value. They decided they wouldn't wait for a law of diminishing returns to flatten volatility and wanted to be a transactional currency right away. It was time to get rich quick.

There is a constant need for the merchants to convert bch back to their native currencies. Then there are also traders who want to sell their bch to buy something else with the fiat.

Therefore, to build a successful currency the liquidity of it is essential. This means, there is a buyer at all levels from the close to spot to 0 (just in case of a flash crash - to 0 is unlikely but possible at least theoretically).

When the price moves up, then just add bids together with bch (say, spot -5 %).

BTC is a Ponzi toy, BCH is just another centralized dev project that protends to be bitcoin while limiting blocksize. We are only left with BSV as the one and only original bitcoin. Why can't people understand this?

For anyone interested I wrote a post explaining why changing the protocol in any way destroys Bitcoin: [https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/snf9o6/three\_reasons\_why\_you\_cannot\_change\_the\_protocol/](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/snf9o6/three_reasons_why_you_cannot_change_the_protocol/)

This is something that everyone can't seem to understand. You cannot change the bitcoin protocol without making it completely meaningless. It's like saying the ""community"" can fork and change *George R. R. Martin: A Game of Thrones series*. If a book series can just be changed arbitrarily then there is no real story! The same exact thing is true for a blockchain. The ledger records a ""story"" of the transaction history. If the chain can be arbitrarily forked into multiple versions based on ""opinion"" and ""politics"" then there is no real bitcoin story! Who owns what is all just imagination and personal opinion. *What's the point??????*

The only objective version of Bitcoin that can ever exist, is the original design of Satoshi. He is the author of the book of transactions. A 'real bitcoin' can only be transferred when it abides by the original rules. You change the rules, you are making up your own story so don't call it Bitcoin, call it something else!

I also find it impossible to understand how anyone could advocate for a money system that is changeable by a small dev group. That is not decentralization. Nowhere in the whitepaper does it talk about governance by devs! This is even worse than fiat currencies where you at least get to elect leaders if it's a democracy. In ""centralized dev coins"", there is no voting, it's just hierarchy of control in what is essentially a private company that pretends to be decentralized. I'm not fooled, but many idiots are. The protocol is supposed to be locked because that is the only realistic way of having a global decentralized cash system that doesn't rot away from internal corruption. This is like iq=56 level obvious.

Bitcoin (BSV) is for people who truly value decentralization and truth. Both BTC and BCH are just centralized shitcoin scams that scam people into buying their airdropped tokens while claiming these fake tokens are ""bitcoins"". Since when is lying ok?

The only blockchain that is tracking ***real bitcoins*** is the BSV chain. It is following real original rules, not made-up rules. That is the truth.",0,btc,2022-02-10 10:11:13

spnanr,MobTwo,52,https://redd.it/spnanr,‚å® Discussion,Improvements To This Subreddit,"I was travelling and only heard about what happened to ShadowOfHarbringer today. As some of you knew, he's not the first victim of the trolls campaign targeting this subreddit because BitcoinXio also got suspended by Reddit. It is not a coincidence that these mods were suspended due to the trolls. People who don't learn from mistakes are bound to repeat them, so I would like to make a couple of suggestions to make this subreddit less welcoming towards trolls. 

My opinion is that free speech does not mean speech without consequences. On top of that, allowing trolls to thrive also meant that good people are being chased away. Sometimes these good people leave, and they never come back. So if I have to choose between the trolls and good people, I will choose good decent people every single time.

The problem allowing trolls to constantly create problems in this subreddit is that humans being humans, we make mistakes. There will be times when we make less than perfect decisions. The solution is to remove the trolls so that everyone else, including mods, do not need to be on constant perfection all the time, or risk making a mistake during a bad day and have their account suspended. Downvoting trolls makes them less visible, but very visible nevertheless, so it makes the problem less visible for everyone else, which doesn't solve the problem. It makes more sense to eliminate a trouble maker than to ask the other 800k community members to tolerate these troublemakers.

As a mod (effectively today), I would like to be more tough on the trolls and spammers so that everyone else have a better time on this subreddit. I have not taken any actions yet and would like to have a discussion among the folks here to see if there is something I missed.",22,btc,2022-02-11 02:04:18

spyj34,JarmoViikki,13,https://redd.it/spyj34,None,What if we get people...,"...To embrace BCH as a store of value like btc?

There is nothing wrong by advertising it as a store of value and digital gold.

In fact, the markets are showing us that it is more valued concept than a method of payment.   
There is enough space in the world to have multiple store of value coins. In fact, when btc grows it is likely some will seek other coins as well. How I see the development going from here (one scenario). First btc becomes so gigantic that it is expensive for people to accumulate it (the transaction fee from your exchange to your cold storage), then the regular people are starting to seek alternative coins that have similar properties. Then BCH can start attracting store of value use. 

Let us not bash btc - it is stupid. It sometimes feels like being in a kindergarden when I read the silly fights of egos on which coin is better, which one is the original one (who cares the original - markets decide which use case is the most valued - we cannot change the markets).",13,btc,2022-02-11 12:41:07

sqnew0,jldqt,69,https://redd.it/sqnew0,None,Chill out with SmartBCH advertising,"This might be a bit controversial and I hope people take this the right way. I don't want to shit on SmartBCH and I think that it will become a good and useful side chain in the future but currently people have pinned their hope on it to the point where it's bordering on false advertisement and it's making me cringe every time.

For example I recently saw a picture on Twitter with a diagram stating that BCH is *ultrasound* money compared to BTC being *sound* money due to the fee burn on SmartBCH. The thing is that there currently is **no** burn of BCH taking place. Every Satoshi that ever moved to the sidechain is still in custody of CoinFLEX regardless of the circulating supply within SmartBCH. [edit: As pointed out in the comments CoinFLEX har indeed manually burned BCH] This is a really shitty argument that won't convince anyone that BCH is better than BTC in any way and makes the person making the argument (and possibly the BCH community at large) seem dishonest.

I know that there is a good reason for having CoinFLEX as the sole minter of sBCH while the trust less bridge is under construction since it will allow people to develop tools and services, but please don't loose sight of the fundamentals. I don't doubt CoinFLEX have their hearts in all the right places and will always do the right thing, but trusting a single entity is the exact opposite of the reason Bitcoin was created in the first place. Anyone that starts to look at SmartBCH because they have heard of its decentralization will get really disappointed of the current state.

The main selling point and IMHO the reason SmartBCH is interesting at all is because of the trust less peg it is advertised to have (SHA-Gate). If this thing works as intended this is a new era in blockchain technology but we have to be honest that it isn't fully developed yet, let alone deployed. The *current* security model of SmartBCH is objectively worse then Blockstreams Liquid and advertising a *current* system because of *expected* features resembles a BTC maxi talking about Lightning Network a lot.

sqpo0q,TheWorldofGood,21,https://redd.it/sqpo0q,ü§î Opinion,"If my country is about to be invaded, I would move my wealth to Bitcoin Cash","The recent news about Ukraine got me thinking what would I do if my country is about to invaded by a foreign country? What if I was living in a country where my bank account will be frozen or inaccessible? What if tyrants or soldiers come to my village and take everything I own like it happened to Jews in Nazi Germany? What would be my safe haven to store my lifesavings and wealth? How can I protect my assets from seizure or robbery?

I think that I would need to put my wealth in a safe place that is not controlled by anyone or any government and can be accessed anywhere any time. Bitcoin Core (BTC) appears to be an attractive option at first, but the time to process its transaction and the transaction fees are not practical enough for someone who needs his funds whenever possible in order to buy food, water, medicine, and more during war. If my family is injured in war, can I wait for BTC to complete its slow transaction? Can I afford to pay its high fees? I don't think so. How about Ethereum and its gas fee? I think I would run out of money quickly while waiting for its slow transaction to go through.

Thus I think Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is the best wartime cryptocurrency for its efficiency, practicality, security, simplicity, and accessibility. BCH is simpler, faster, and easier to use than BTC or ETH. Even if I were to die from war, my family can pick up my seed words and use my BCH immediately to buy food and daily necessities whenever they need it. BCH is so easy to use that a child or an elderly can use it. How about BTC and ETH? How would they know about their expensive fees and the slow transaction time that they would have to wait to buy a loaf of bread or a medicine?

All in all, Bitcoin Cash is the solution and should be chosen over complex crypto like BTC and ETH.

sqt20c,BeginningRace1270,5,https://redd.it/sqt20c,None,I think Bitcoin Cash lovers should know about CoinFLEX,"**Disclaimer: I am a FLEX token staker.**

I discovered this exchange by looking for a ""safe"" stablecoin that didn't cost much to transfer (flexUSD). By the way that's not the only thing I would like to talk you today, I would like to tell my experience with CoinFLEX till now.

Almost 2 months passed since I decided to put my first money in CoinFLEX by minting some flexUSD and since then I couldn't find any better exchange. Of course, it's not perfect and I'll list every pros and cons I've met so far.

We know how much important is an exchange orientation to a particular coin (or coins) in order to indirectly increase its charm. For example, we know that some exchanges are suspected of unclear transactions against some coins and widely favorable to other coins. This scenario is obviously unhealthy if the disadvantaged is Bitcoin Cash.

At the same time I'm not even totally down for those exchange that love just one or few coins. I think that exchanges used to be friendly (not maxi) to a coin or a few coins isn't that bad. Crypto ecosystem has a lot to offer to everyone.

So, let's start talking about CoinFLEX, one of the best exchange I've met so far.

**Here there is what I consider...**

# PROS

* Bitcoin Cash (BCH) friendly: not maxi, friendly!
* It supports smartBCH and SHA bridging is getting closer and closer XD
* 0% maker fees [https://coinflex.com/fees/](https://coinflex.com/fees/)
* Starting from 0.08% taker fees, even lower if you hold FLEX [https://coinflex.com/fees/](https://coinflex.com/fees/)
* flexUSD stablecoin which generates passive interests up to 20% APR [My personal guide about it](https://www.reddit.com/r/CoinFLEX/comments/smkawu/flexusd_or_flex_whats_the_best_investment_my/)
* FLEX token which generate active interests if staked [My personal guide about it](https://www.reddit.com/r/CoinFLEX/comments/smkawu/flexusd_or_flex_whats_the_best_investment_my/)
* AMM+ (Automatic Market Maker Plus): a good capital efficient automated market maker [https://coinflex.com/amm/set-up-lp](https://coinflex.com/amm/set-up-lp)
* AMM+ Arena: a game-like AMM+ with various prizes and bonus [https://coinflex.com/amm\_arena](https://coinflex.com/amm_arena)
* A friendly staff and community
* A fast and decisive answer by the staff if any technical problem occurs
* A section totally dedicated to CoinFLEX's transparency [https://coinflex.com/transparency](https://coinflex.com/transparency)
* Sometime original efforts by the community members to improve CoinFLEX in any aspect are rewarded with tips
* It already has Android and iOS mobile apps [https://coinflex.com/mobile-app/](https://coinflex.com/mobile-app/)
* The following cons are probably just impermanent

# CONS

* It needs more pairs
* It needs more liquidity on some pairs
* It needs a fiat onramp
* It needs a US version (pretty sure it will come before the end of the year)

ssybny,Andriaus,16,https://redd.it/ssybny,None,A huge list of Bitcoin-friendly VPN providers. Looking for more providers to list.,"Hello,

&#x200B;

I would like to share my website: [Bitcoin-vpn.com](https://Bitcoin-vpn.com) \- a huge list of VPN providers ( currently 78 VPN providers ) which accept Bitcoin ( and another crypto) as a payment. Personally checked each one.

The main goal is to have a very good quality list of providers without a bulls\*\*t, as other review websites do. The top provider is paying the most and it is not acceptable for me. I am still working on some providers to review, Also I am going to update my reviews every week, recheck providers, order services, and test services as a user.

If you know any VPN provider, which accepts Bitcoin, please let me know. Also, what is the most important to VPN users? As I am going to update my reviews, there may be other criteria added.

Your opinion is always welcome.",27,btc,2022-02-15 08:35:11

Hello, this is one of reddit's most resilient mods, ShadowOfHarbringer again. They tried to [cancel](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/q85h9g/i_just_saw_something_really_disturbing_roger_its/) and [ban](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/sog87u/youre_welcome/) me multiple times, but I keep coming back, just like Bitcoin (Cash) keeps coming back despite the constant attacks.

Unfortunately due to this account being in danger of being shut down by doing just literally anything, I have decided to retire it and only use in case of emergencies. Reddit rules keep changing constantly and what is considered ""harassment"" or generally unwanted behaviour keeps being moving target, which means it is impossible to know what I can or cannot do and what kind of action will effect in shutdown of this valuable mod account tomorrow.

I am generally not in the habit of undermining the work of my predecessors (and also I am no longer an active top mod so why would I engage in the decision process), which means /u/jessquit stays the top mod and he with /u/LovelyDayHere and /u/MobTwo run the show currently. Which means that any decisions and any direction they have taken will remain in place.

It is going to remain this way at least until I devise a plan of moving forward without this account being active, which means few months.

Of course, **I am not leaving** Bitcoin Cash community and I will keep **lurking in the shadows‚Ñ¢**, while protecting this community from bots, but I leave the task of moderating in the capable hands of **jessquit**, MobTwo, LovelyDayHere and others.",43,btc,2022-02-17 14:08:15

Please name all the implementations that can safely be used to 'run' BCH. I think I am going to refer to them as ""gatekeepers"" in a article I am working on. Feel free to suggest a better term if you do not like that one. Implementations that are not yet fully functional but are working to become so would be good to add with that caveat. I am not sure if the definition of ""fully functional"" is settled or still debatable.

I am thinking each of the individual implementations is basically ""centralized"" for now.

suxkpt,Big_Bubbler,18,https://redd.it/suxkpt,None,"Adding ""fast"" to the dream of Bitcoin. Is Doublespend proofs the BCH way?","I am thinking the dream of Bitcoin includes something like a 10+/- minute confirmation time? I'll state my working definition of ""the dream"" below. Anyway, for practicality of e-money I think we will need much faster reliability. BTC has just said ""no"" to speed (and the dream). eCash is working on adding Avalanche code I do not yet grasp. BCH has touted doublespend proofs. Is that all BCH will need/use for speed? I am working on an article and plan to say BCH has that as it's plan. If there is more than that planned for making BCH fast, I would not want to understate the intended BCH way forward.

My working definition summarizing ""the dream of Bitcoin"":

Secure and sufficiently-decentralized (censorship resistant) e-money for the people of the world without significant inflation or usage fees.

Happy to hear opinions on changing that summary/definition. For instance, opinions on why it might be better to say something like ""Peer-to-peer cash"" instead of ""e-money"" would be interesting to hear.

suzeu6,Big_Bubbler,9,https://redd.it/suzeu6,None,"Current actual use, current capacity in in POW-secured transactions per day","I am working on a chart. I am looking for very-approximate numbers (need not be very accurate but should not be exaggerated). 

BTC is about ""x?"" TX's per day when it's mem pool is full and I assume its current capacity is not much higher due to fee pressures. Maybe 120%? of ""x"". I assume Lightning network TXs do not fit the definition of real Bitcoin transactions. That definition can be seen in another recent post of mine.

I am thinking BCH's currant actual use ""y?"" is lower than ""x"" currently and that BCH's actual current capacity is at least 32 times as much as BTC's capacity? I am sure capacity is a controversial number and I am happy to hear the differing opinions. I do think there is a currently safe block size limit BCH should not try to exceed (at a steady throughput). I do not assume block size increases are the only way to increase BCH's capacity. I assume BCH is working to up it's capacity to fulfill the dream of Bitcoin:

As for the Bitcoin dream goal for massive worldwide adoption I think I have heard numbers like 50 or 100 Billion transactions per day. Anyone care to comment on that? I think my chart will go out to 100B or 1 Trillion Tx's per day. Is that enough?",3,btc,2022-02-17 21:08:51
suzwb4,Proof_Artichoke_2557,4,https://redd.it/suzwb4,ü§î Opinion,I don‚Äôt think there is another market such as Cannabis that really needs a DeFi solution.,"I‚Äôm thinking that paying for cannabis became a concern as more states allow the drug for recreational use. In order to purchase buds, there are numerous hurdles before getting your baggie. Recent attempts in Congress to pass the SAFE Banking Act faltered, so federal assistance is now out of the question.

When it comes to processing payments, dispensaries run into big problems, and they don't always want to handle cash. In 2021, crypto for cannabis had a massive year and will eventually be approved in the cannabis sector.

Despite the increasing acceptability and legalization of cannabis for adult use across the country, it remains heavily controlled and outlawed at the federal level. While the number of legal dispensaries is increasing in a number of states, the federal government is still refusing to legalize it. This is why there should an appropriate DeFi solution come in useful. One of the leading DeFis for cannabis is Tangi. Their ecosystem seems to tackle the cornerstone issues. However, nobody can know how this will influence the community or will the community react to these changes. Is it still too early for decentralized finances?",0,btc,2022-02-17 21:29:28

I have been a user for more   than 4  years on the localbitcoins platform and I never had any kind of    technical problem.

But    unfortunately, a month ago, I had an issue after making a transfer of    funds to my localbitcoins wallet. To make the transfer, I went to the    localbitcoins website from my mobile and check my wallet address. I    copy-pasted on another platform to make the deposit. The next day the    deposit was not made in the wallet, and I contacted the localbitcoins    support team, I sent them an image. When they check it, they said the    wallet address appeared in the image was not a valid localbitcoins    address. They told me: ‚Äúyou were a victim of a malware.‚Äù

It    seemed to be as the support team say it, but since I'm not a regular    user, I returned to my mobile phone and went to the site again, and  the   address that they said was not localbitcoins address was there,  but I   started browsing the localbitcoins site and record a video, I  was   browsing in different links of the site, and when I go back to the    wallet, The same address that they said was false was there, but I    continued browsing the site and I wrote a message to the support team    from there, the message was sent it to the conversation with them.

I    wrote them again, because I could browse on all the localbitcoins   site,  with all the links options, I could check different localbitcoins    settings, I even check my balance and all the support messages with   the  same support ticket number, and I was still seeing the same address   they  said was false. When I sing out and log in again, the wallet   address  was changed.

They didn't   want to  receive the video because their platform does not accept video   format,  so I sent the images of the video. They told me that it's a   phishing  site, but, how I could see my personal settings?, how I could   see the  support messages?, how I could sent them a message from there,   and this  message it's in the support ticket threads.

Currently, the localbitcoins support not responding to my messages and questions.

I    think it's a bug in the localbitcoins platform, if so, they should   return the bitcoins that I lost in that transaction. They say it's a    phishing site, and I lost my bitcoins. In [the video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10UH3EG6XRE)  you can see the  address, start in 13cTkds, this is the one that they  say  is not valid. I  can see my account balance, my account messages,  there  are two new  messages, one of them from the support team. Other  message  is a message  of my last transaction with a localbitcoins user,   FraymarNoguera,  actually was the last transaction. I browse though my   profile and there  are all my settings options. It's the localbitcoins   site, without a  doubt, the most remarkable thing is that I sent a   message from there to  the support team, and when I return to the  wallet,  you can see the  same address that they say is false.

I would like to know your opinion, is this a malware issue?, phishing?, Is a bug on the localbitcoins platform?.

sw9dbp,JarmoViikki,33,https://redd.it/sw9dbp,None,Upcoming Crypto Confiscation,"Hello,

&#x200B;

I watched recently a video from Davincij Jeremie (the early adopter of bitcoin - I think he bought in 2010).

Now he is warning the people about the coming crypto asset confiscation.

He is saying that governments are not going to come to your door and steal your cryptos (or other inflation hedges) but they do it in the same manner they did with gold. Namely, paying a small premium over the spot price first. Then when they have bought your cryptos (or a decent amount of cryptos), then they will reprice it at higher level. Making those who sold early losing their purchasing power. 

&#x200B;

It is my estimate, that this could happen relatively soon. All the signs are pointing to this direction. 

Inflation is not going to be tamed (95% likelihood and only 5 % that they will be able to tame the inflation). 

My suggestion is to remove sell orders from exchanges, store your coins in place it is not easy to sell when you have emotional fear based impulses (if you tend to sell based on fear).

If possible, buy more with fiat money that is going to be worthless in a few years. Look at how fast it escalated in Venezuela or in Zimbabwe earlier. 

Please, be careful when selling. Especially, on the bottom.

&#x200B;

How much are you guys increasing your BCH holdings per day?

For me it is on average 0.0825 BCH/day. This is an average for longer period, I do not buy every day. I accumulate regularly though (the most recent one was this morning).

&#x200B;

Notice, I am not spending any bch - I am just adding.

Also, I am adding some other cryptos but this is clearly an accumulation zone for me. For pretty much any crypto.

Considering the fact that there are 0.0042 BCH/person available, my daily accumulation is something I am very happy about.

I could barely find my way around the thing, and i'm actually good with technology!

As it stands, i cannot recommend it to newbies who know nothing about cryptocurrencies.

* Installable from the app market
* Self-custodial
* Relatively simple to use
* With a clean interface

szdf7c,bitcoincashautist,13,https://redd.it/szdf7c,‚öôÔ∏è Technology,[CHIP] Unforgeable Groups V6.0 Decentralized Applications on Bitcoin Cash,"About a week ago Jason had pinged me and gave me a heads up that he's working on something, and today he has [announced that something](https://old.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/sz0q1g/chip_cashtokens_v2_token_primitives_for_bitcoin/), and it resembles Group Tokens quite a bit, which is great! Great because he built it from scratch and independently arrived to something very similar, and to me it's a validation of the Group approach :)

I am also thankful to him, because his ping prompted me to revisit [Thomas Zander's idea](https://gitlab.com/0353F40E/group-tokenization/-/issues/19) of using the TXID as the groupID (or categoryID), and looking at that part of ""idea space"" again, I discovered something better than I could have imagined, a facility that could seamlessly let us transition from contract to contract from commitment to commitment from token to token.

I held off broadly announcing V6.0 because I was waiting to see what Jason's been working on, and I find it cool that it's so similar, because its an independent validation of the Group approach :)

I've been bouncing Group for months now, and we really worked hard to making the consensus layer as simple as possible, and I think that with V6.0 we can implement everything CT2.0 promises while keeping consensus layer simple and using Script for the flexibility it provides.

Without furder ado, copying the [announcement](https://bitcoincashresearch.org/t/chip-2021-02-group-tokenization-for-bitcoin-cash/311/53) from research forum.

[MAJOR UPDATE - 6.0](https://gitlab.com/0353F40E/group-tokenization/-/merge_requests/18)

This was prompted by exchanging notes with @bitjson and revisiting @tom 's idea of [declaring the genesis](https://gitlab.com/0353F40E/group-tokenization/-/issues/19), and it enables group tokens to interact so much better with Script!

Changes:

* Whole new approach to group genesis: instead of inferring it from the TX, it will be explicitly declared as an input prefix that can use the same byte because it will be exclusive to input context.
* One more introspection opcode to access the genesis input's generated `groupID` preimage.
* Change group amount format from VarInt to fixed width uint.

Instead of inferring genesis from orphan outputs and allowing orphans only if the groupID matches the hash, we require the genesis to be declared on the inputs, conceptually similar to a coinbase input. A new introspection opcode is added to access the input's genesis preimage.
Advantages:

* enables flexibility in deciding which input will be a genesis input
* enables flexibility in deciding which input's prevout will be committed to for later use in smart contracts
* enables better interaction with contracts requiring or verifying the genesis operation
* removes malleability from group genesis (outputs are signed, and orphans disallowed)
* more consistent with Bitcoin design (coinbase input)
* enables versioning the genesis preimage construction without having to spend scarce group type bits which will be reserved for potential ""super-contract"" optimizations in the future
* opens the path to a future upgrade where user-defined parts of the genesis TX could be appended to the preimage
* enables a dedicated genesis nonce field which simplifies grinding the group type, making the group type encoding time-space trade-off more convenient

>The user pays 10,000 satoshis to get a token. They can transfer that token to use 2-of-3, then back to single sig, then deposit the token and get back their 10,000 satoshis from the parent covenant.

There are 2 contracts:

1. NFT, placed on the prevout which will be spent as group genesis input and generate the NFT. The prevout script will require that 10,000 sats are paid into a fixed P2SH address (depository corporation covenant). Only the 1st spend is from a P2SH, the genesis input spend: the NFT can then be moved to an ordinary P2PKH and still be able to reclaim the 10,000 by burning itself in the same TX as *any* covenant UTXO.

2. The depository corporation covenant is an anyone-can-spend kind of thing, but it requires *any* NFT that can satisfy the proof of payment at genesis to be burned to an OP_RETURN. The NFT's genesis script is verified to match the template hardcoded in the P2SH covenant.

Not only does this create a BCH-backed NFT, it also lets NFT holders reclaim the BCH from *any* covenant UTXO :) I suspect there's a way to make some kind of BCH mixer based on this.

PS, for comparing the 2 proposals, consider how CT2.0 and Group map to each other:

`<category_id> -> groupID`  
`<has_nonfungible> -> groupType`  
`commitment_length, commitment -> subGroup (dropped feature)`  
`amount -> groupAmount`

and we worked for months on simplifying group, so we have only 1 groupType and any custom behavior should be done by Script

and now this proposal introduces 5 types on the consensus layer...

PPS We can have ""standard"" tokens, a P2SH covenant can require a particular genesis setup, and indexers could scan that one P2SH address and auto-magically add tokens to their database whenever someone spends from the covenant

No idea what deposits and balances is supposed to mean. When I heard non-custodial I expect that to mean they cannot access or seize my funds.

>While the investigation is ongoing, ChangeNOW reserves the right to transfer the frozen funds to a cold storage. It would be done for ensuring their safekeeping.

t05o5n,DrankTooMuchTequila,28,https://redd.it/t05o5n,None,Opinion: cryptocurrency cannot survive if it is to be constantly associated against the dollar.,"I myself for one am guilty for this in the past, I kept relating cryptocurrency as an investment even months back, price plummets, I grew sick and tired of the worth against the dollar. I care more now about how my crypto is my crypto, unable to be seized by authorities, unable to be taxed, unable to be having fees taken from large corporations. I now hold only BCH. I stopped caring about the $/BCH as much as I did.

The original intention of cryptocurrency was not meant to be traded back and forth from fiat, but crypto to goods.

Why care about price, valued against the dollar? Why can't we see crypto valued against a kilo of wheat, a pound of gold, a car? Isn't cryptocurrency a currency, as its name suggests?

Crypto's main purpose is not to make more fiat, it's to be financially autonomous.

Its valuation against fiat is just a measure of how strong it is to just fiat. And say, if a kilo of wheat is also worth less against fiat, it shouldn't make a difference. What matters is the people who would take the crypto off their hands for what their good is worth. And that's how a currency should be.",25,btc,2022-02-24 08:08:46

t08i7h,bitcoincashautist,20,https://redd.it/t08i7h,‚ùóWOW,"Celebrating Permissionless Development (Two CHIPs, One Tech)","It's now been about a year since I  decided to get involved in BCH development. When I started this journey,  I didn't have the knowledge required to arrive where we are today, but I  was confident in my capacity to attain it as I go, and in my capacity  to make noise required to get things moving! I never asked for  permission, I just did what I believed needed to be done, because I  wanted P2PKH tokens, which I wanted because I believed they're important  for BCH future. I know I ruffled some feathers here and there and went  over the top at times, but now looking back it was a fun ride!

This was my introduction that I wrote on BCH Discord on 2021-02-14:

*Hi all, I want to help move group tokens forward, I saw the  interview with Andrew and George and got excited about them, then I read  up more, about both group tokens and cash tokens, and figured that  while both seem like good solutions, group tokens would enable  competitive advantage whereas cash tokens would be playing catch up with  other blockchains. I intend to keep the group tokens idea afloat and  help bring it before more eyes until either: 1. I give up or have my  mind changed about them 2. They get adopted :slight\_smile: I'm halfway  through that document Andrew prepared and I want to use it as basis to  prepare something easier to read, something higher level, that can be  passed around other stakeholders and will actually get read. Focus  should be on identifying stakeholders (users, businesses, miners, node  operators, etc.) and what group tokens would cost them and what benefits  they would provide. My intuition here is that they could provide a lot  of value to our ecosystem at a small cost (slightly changing the slope  of linear scaling). I have work to do to confirm or invalidate this  assumption but you have to start somewhere...*

Thanks to everyone who's interacted with me since then I learned A  LOT, and had my mind changed many times, in a good way, about what Group  needs to be, not whether it's a good idea or not. I like to believe I  did my part in opening people's eyes that it IS a great idea, one that  will bring a lot of value to BCH, and through this process we've gotten  really close to the idea's final shape! That's how the Group CHIP got to  [v6.0](https://gitlab.com/0353F40E/group-tokenization/-/blob/f11857a54fde8a81d0df5f026a26fa650f5aeab1/CHIP-2021-02_Unforgeable_Groups_for_Bitcoin_Cash.md)  and is now titled ""Unforgeable Groups"", because it's all about enabling  something more abstract, generic blockchain ""primitives"" that can let  builders create amazing things, at no additional cost to our network,  and allow users easy access to those products through easy ""P2PKH""  tokens, those that can interact with contracts and be moved around as  easy and cheap as BCH!

Talking with imaginary\_username over the last few months, we were trying to  find a minimal set of primitives that can later enable features/products  that we can‚Äôt even imagine right now. We had no idea that at the same  time Jason was doing a sort of ‚Äúclean room design‚Äù, and now that he [revealed it](https://bitcoincashresearch.org/t/725), all I can say is - it‚Äôs brilliant! It's a validation of everything we've been through! Quoting Jason:

*I claim that these primitives are emergent from the design of the  Bitcoin Cash virtual machine: I did not design them to accomplish a set  of ‚Äúfeatures‚Äù, I just discovered they are missing.*

We were on the same track all along, on the path of discovering the  same jewel in ""idea space"". So, now we have not one, but two CHIPs,  trying to capture almost the same idea! It's like we dug 2 tunnels to  arrive to the same treasure! The digging paid off! And we didn't start  digging from 0, I only continued where Andrew Stone had left it. Jason  did good to [list all of these ""tunnels""](https://github.com/bitjson/cashtokens#incompatibility-of-token-fungibility-and-token-commitments), now 5 of them in total :)

When Jason's CHIP landed, at first I was like, oh damn, 2 CHIPs now,  this will spread us thin, it'll double the amount of effort required to  move things forward, but on a second thought it‚Äôs awesome because  Jason's CHIP is really good!! It‚Äôll help more people grasp the idea,  find their way through the tunnels, and make a stronger case for  activating the tech, I don‚Äôt really care what we call it, CashTokens  sounds good to me! :) Jason's writing is much more eloquent than mine.  Mine is rather messy, but the ideas got through and that's what really  matters, that's what this CHIP process is all about, path of discovery!

Thinking about how to avoid spreading ourselves thin I think I see a  way: if we can converge on the same spec, we‚Äôll have 2 CHIPs making a  bullet-proof case for the same thing! 2 CHIPs, one tech!

t25ta3,OneDev42,2,https://redd.it/t25ta3,None,I am tired of all the scams in this space,"[Audio version/TL;DR >>](https://www.jotform.com/app/220476173895970)

It‚Äôs sad to see that we can barely go a day without hearing about another NFT rug-pull, grift or crypto-scam. Web3 was founded on the idea of a new decentralized internet in which we take back control from the big players and build something of-for-and-by the people.

There are so many good ideals:

\- Privacy

\- Creators getting paid what they're worth

\- Taking back control from centralized players

\- Freedom of expression

However, this whole concept seems to just be good marketing with no real substance. It‚Äôs as if the idea of putting us in charge of our future is just good marketing to get us to buy into the next big grift.

&#x200B;

**Let‚Äôs take privacy, for example:**

Web3 allows us to be anonymous by allowing anyone to create a new wallet address and start a new list of transactions. However, we're in a situation where scammers are able to run wild and create new identities each time they get exposed. There are now whole ‚ÄúNFT factories‚Äù doing these scams on rinse-and-repeat because it‚Äôs so easy.

Not only that, for ordinary people, an immutable blockchain address is a terrible idea for privacy. As you use the address, more and more personal information gets attached to it, and it becomes a public database of what you do. Do we really want everyone in the world to see everything we're doing? What we own? Every transaction we make? And what if someone sends a picture of our front door to our address? Or even an indecent photo? You have no recourse, no civility, no humanity at all.

When has decentralization done anything for privacy anyway? A decentralized system is not only more easy to exploit but very difficult to patch and update.

&#x200B;

**Usability:**

The only thing making the blockchain usable by any ordinary person right now is centralized parties like Coinbase. Why hasn't the technology been made with usability from the ground up? Doesn't this defeat the whole purpose?

&#x200B;

**An interoperable metaverse:**

I can't even begin to list issues with this, so I'm just going to send you to a video: [https://youtu.be/I5ao5AwZLZY?t=378](https://youtu.be/I5ao5AwZLZY?t=378)

I‚Äôd like to say one thing‚Ä¶ calling your semi-functional virtual world a ‚ÄúMetaverse‚Äù to sell ‚Äúland‚Äù is deeply disingenuous.

&#x200B;

**A bad foundation:**

I get it, we're all tired of companies like Facebook doing things they shouldn't with our data, but the ideas Web3 is founded on are fundamentally flawed. Decentralization does not create either community or privacy.

We need a future that puts people in control. A future based on ideas that will have a reasonable chance against massive centralized corporate pushes and walled gardens.

&#x200B;

**A different take:**

Right now I'm in decentralized game development, but I'd love to team up with people who are passionate about the \*ideals\* of Web3 and research the creation of something new.

My idea is to gather people who want to make a difference and build a centralized, bespoke, usable, foundation for the Metaverse. Namely, something that functions like Wikipedia, with similar values to open source. The end goal would be a private, people-first virtual experience.

I‚Äôll put my contact info and more info about what we are doing on a website: [https://ocem.cc/web3](https://ocem.cc/web3)",7,btc,2022-02-26 20:06:29

A team and I are interested in launching an online platform that will ONLY host vendors that accept cryptocurrency as payment. The problem that we think exists and needs to be solved is the inconsistent/irregular acceptance of crypto (vendor A accepts it, vendor B doesn't etc.), so users who want to actually pay with it don't have a single place they can reliably use it. (As far as I can tell, there isn't really anything like this right now - am I wrong?)

I basically have two questions:

1. Do you have any general feedback on the concept?
2. If your feedback is positive, are there any categories of things that you would be most likely to spend crypto on? Would you spend on goods or services? What kind?

Some of those exchange  wallets have held Bitcoin for over 1 year, while others hold Bitcoin  that was purchased less than 365 days ago. That means some of my BTC is  subject to long-term capital gains while other sources of BTC are still  subject to short-term capital gains, according to US tax law.

If  I consolidate these different sources of BTC into one cold storage  wallet, how would I be taxed if I made a withdraw from that cold-storage  wallet in the near future? 

This would assume that I withdraw BTC from  cold storage before all the BTC in that cold storage wallet officially  enters long-term capital gains territory.

* As  a hypothetical example, let's say one exchange contains 0.75 BTC that  is over 1 year old, and my other exchange contains 0.25 BTC that is only  30 days old. Then I send both of those sources of BTC to the same cold  storage wallet. Let's say that in 2 weeks I decide to withdraw 0.10 BTC. Is the  withdraw of 0.10 BTC going to be taxed according to long-term or short-term capital gains?

Does it  make sense to get another cold storage hardware wallet to separately store crypto that is still in short-term cap gains territory from my long-term capital gains crypto?

I understand fees are high sometimes.  But even when 1 sat per byte BTC transactions aare clearing, and have been for 50 or 100blocks, the minimum next block fee of the BCH site never dips below 25-50 cents,  which is a 3-5x of what one should pay (a 1 sat per byte is less than a dime).

If you don't believe me,  pull up the two websites yourself and keep them open over a week and see for yourself.

When BCH proponents use questionable sources to make their point, new people will question why they need to exaggerate by 5 or 21x.   BTC fees are not perpetually cheap nor perpetually expensive, but for the last year or so  the fees have range from 8-9 cents to 10-20$ (and the average fee charts don't represent the average user,  who has a 240 byte tx to send, so these average fee charts include complex transactions from exchanges that are 100 times more complex and costt 100x more).  But as a user of BTC, who uses it weekly, I pay 95% of the time pay 1 or 2  sat per byte. I think The highest have I have paid for a tx came out to 5$.

Even 50 cents isn't my ideal fee that I want to pay,  and 5$ is unacceptable.   but there is no need to create misleading fee estimator sites, that will lead new people to overpay.

This discussion is about this discrepancy, not whether or not  you think BTC is broken or taken over by Blockstream, tether ect.

I still hold a few BCH, and have used it within the past year.

[I dont understand where the BCH site gets it's data or how it does it,  But a 21x difference seems like something is not right.  ](https://preview.redd.it/sjlyao2nt2l81.png?width=2526&format=png&auto=webp&s=9067f08aad81f9bbc384b5834088124363a154f4)

EDIT:  I actually held onto my BCH when they forked, taking a position that I  would just see what would happen.  Since I had put my net worth in BTC  over a period of 2 years starting in 2013, I did this because I wanted  out of fiat and trad-fi, and to be a self sovereign person.   Since BCH  overly under performed versus BTC I liquidated all but like a few BCH  and traded them at almost a 1:1 ratio for ETH (I also sold off my BSV  and BTG).I'm not a BTC maxi as I hold other things like monero.  I also hold some  LTC.  I have only had to resort to using BCH one time because BTC fees  were to high, and I used LTC a handful of times to buy things as well.It's not good to be a maxi of any coin.

Like I said in a previous post I actually held onto my BCH when they forked, taking neutral position, and a wait and see.  Since I had put my very modest net worth in BTC over a period of 2 years starting in 2013, I did this because I wanted  out of fiat and trad-fi, and to be a self sovereign person.   Since BCH extremely under performed versus BTC I liquidated all but like a few BCH  and traded them at almost a 1:1 ratio for ETH (I also sold off my BSV  and BTG).  
 I'm not a BTC maxi as I hold other things like monero.  I also hold some  LTC.  I have only had to resort to using BCH one time because BTC fees  were to high, and I used LTC a handful of times to buy things as well.  
 It's not good to be a maxi of any coin.   I also don't want to hold onto  an under-performing asset just because I'm ideologically dedicated to  it.

So my investment advice would be toe hold a batch of cryptos, that include BTC/ETH/XMR and maybe one other.   I would keep some BCH for the payments.

t5p310,ChangeNow_io,13,https://redd.it/t5p310,‚å® Discussion,Which Age Group Is Most Interested in Crypto?,"[**Stilt.com**](https://www.stilt.com/blog/2021/03/vast-majority-crypto-buyers-millennials-gen-z/) carried out a study based on the activities of more than 1.500 users who performed over 1 million crypto transactions between February 2020 and February 2021.

Age groups in 2022 can be defined in the following way:

* **Generation Z (Gen Z)** are people aged 10-25.
* **Millennials** are aged 26-41.
* **Generation X (Gen X)** are men and women who are 42-57 years old.
* **Boomers** are those aged 58 and above.

The Stilt study has shown that over¬†**76% of all buyers are Millennials**. Gen Z takes 2nd place with 17%. Generation X takes up almost 5% of the user share, while there are only 1% of Boomers. The data clearly shows that¬†**94% of those who have bought crypto are 18-41**, and only 6% are buyers aged 42 and older. The conclusion is that the younger you are, the more likely you will purchase digital coins.

It doesn't matter how little, we are a force and I believe together we can actuallize it.

The BCH funding address is attached below

Project description

My dream involves Having a Bus within the school campus in the name of BITCOINCASH.

School: university of Jos, Jos Nigeria

A Toyota HiAce Hummer bus (New or Used): New one would cost upto $50,000 and above while Used one ranges from $20,000 to $30,000 depending on the model year. So, I decided it would be a Used one in good shape.

It would be registered with the transportation department so it has limitless movement within the premises

Printed all over the vehicle would be the BCH's logo and writings briefly explaining what the coin entails. This is away of communicating BCH to every eye that sees this vehicle pass by.

A trust worthy and Crypto oriented driver would be employed. And He would be paid in BCH.
For a start, the bus would be accepting both fiat and BCH for payment. But the cost would be subsidized for those paying in BCH.

After one month in operation, only BCH would be accepted as payment.

The profits generated would be saved up to buy more buses and taxis if possible. And could also be used to reach out to less privileged individuals within the neighboring communities in the name of BCH. Thousands would benefit from this.

At the students bus parks would be a Point of Sale where students could exchange their fiat to BCH and someone would be there to explain to newbies how to get a BCH wallet.

As time goes on, there would be more development like creating a platform where students could board the bus online, read and watch tutorials about BCH and attend online BCH seminars.

https://reddit.com/link/t8d8mk/video/a7uojwww0vl81/player

 The amount of blood I lost was very large, so we acted immediately.

She was transferred to the Nelve clinic, where her wound was treated immediately and her vital signs stabilized.

Right now Mandy is in stable condition, however the wound on her leg is more serious than we think.

The damage generated has endangered the mobility of her paw, so Mandy must undergo surgery and a wide range of therapies to recover a large percentage of the mobility of her paw, thus avoiding her amputation.

The budget given has been 1.8 BCH to cover his surgery and much of his therapy.

We hope to prune as always with your support to save Mandy's mobility.

t9s8os,the_rodent_incident,31,https://redd.it/t9s8os,ü§î Opinion,One and only reason why crypto never took off,"The answer is simple: crypto isn't anti-fragile, **crypto is hyper-fragile.** 

- One wrong click on a phishing email, it's gone. 

- Someone points a gun at you, it's gone.

- Someone kidnaps your family for your coins, it's gone.

- Backdoor the OS, it's gone.

- Delist it, it's done. 

- Push the market into bear, it's done. 

- Worldwide financial crisis, it's done.

- Force excessive regulation and taxation, it's done. 

- Forbid it by a law, it's done.

- Kill or block the exchanges, it's done. 

- Block VPNs and TOR bridges, it's done.

- Cut the Internet, it's done. 

- Cut the electrical power, it's done. 

- Take people's phones and computers, it's done. 

- Take people's freedom, it's done.

- Arrest the developers, it's gone forever.

Crypto is not a honey badger, crypto as a whole is a super-fragile butterfly. It depends on a thousand things being done absolutely and perfectly right, and if even one small cog falls out of place, it is fucked, the whole system grinds to a halt. This is the true reason why it never took off. BTC, BCH, LTC, XMR, doesn't matter which one, they all failed as peer-to-peer cash.",0,btc,2022-03-08 22:09:45

Mandy as we told you in the previous post, was rescued after having suffered an injury, provided by a bad person using a knife.

Unfortunately, even when we manage to control the wound and stabilize it for all the lost blood, Mandy is forced to undergo surgery.

The worst thing about this case is that really what we have left of time is very little, having only tomorrow to be able to save his paw.

Surgery and its subsequent treatments have a high cost, being a budget of 1.8BCH what we need to achieve it.

Otherwise, Mandy will have her paw amputated and she will live her whole life with a special condition.

We look forward to your support and showing the world the incredible things we can accomplish with BCH, save Mandy's life.

ta1ys5,MobTwo,41,https://redd.it/ta1ys5,ü§î Opinion,Observations About The Bitcoin Project,"Having been involved with crypto for many years now, there are a few points that I would like to make, based on my observations.

Observation 1) The Bitcoin project has already been hijacked by Blockstream, likely with the backing of government actors. 2 years ago, I wrote about some evidence suggesting this at https://read.cash/@MobTwo/bitcoin-cash-is-under-attack-and-we-need-your-help-727c6939

I cannot think of anyone else so motivated as to waste money over the past 5 years trying to undermine the efforts of Bitcoin Cash. By now, it is obvious. BTC‚Äôs Lightning Network is collaborating with existing government actors such as World Economic Forum and BTC‚Äôs Lightning Network was listed on the World Economic Forum‚Äôs website. Cory Fields, a BTC developer, is working with the Federal Reserve to create a CBDC (Central Bank Digital Currency).

We could also see a shift in how banks and institutions, normally hostile towards cryptocurrencies are suddenly singing the praises of BTC. It is also not surprising to see traditional media and government employees singing the praises of BTC, since the US government has control over the project.

Observation 2) I was very disappointed about how the whole project derailed. I genuinely believe in the benefits of peer to peer money for the world. I was an idealist but I am also pragmatic. It is easy to criticize people like Adam Back or Cory Fields for working with the government. I would argue that good people will do bad things if being forced to.

Why would someone like Adam Back suddenly changed from supporting blocksize increase to sabotaging the project? Because if we were being coerced to do something, we would probably have done the same thing. The same way soldiers were made to commit war crimes and kill innocent children. I have no doubt many soldiers are good decent people, yet they will do bad things when they are being instructed to. It is hard to say no especially when the instructions are accompanied by coercion.

Observation 3) It is my opinion that the current crypto market is heavily manipulated by the fraudulent Tethers and their cartel of insiders. I could list down all the data points suggesting this but unfortunately, I‚Äôm just not interested enough to spend more time on this. If one were to spend enough time googling, it would be easy to find evidence of fraud all over Tether USDT.

Observation 4) An inflationary monetary system benefits the early recipients of those money while a deflationary monetary system benefits humankind. I won‚Äôt explain why money printing benefits the early recipients the most as this is a well covered topic already. But I will argue that when money is deflationary, people will spend their money much more carefully, buying only what they really want. I believe this will lead to less wastage and a huge drop in pollution globally, benefiting the planet and mankind as a whole. It is easy to be wasteful when money is inflationary and if you don‚Äôt consume, those money will become worthless over time. Obviously, we will spend them while there is still value.

And since governments can‚Äôt print money anymore, there will also be less wars since the war mongering governments can no longer print money to fund wars, wars which most people have little interests in. I‚Äôm not interested in seeing my money being spent to harm or kill someone from another country, absolutely no interest at all.

Observation 5) I would like to emphasize the benefits of Bitcoin Cash to humanity at https://slp.1bch.com/index.asp?action=showBitcoinCashBenefitsFrame

I strongly believe in the value of Bitcoin Cash, even if it is just to preserve the freedom and liberty of people. That alone is valuable to me but of course, Bitcoin Cash is more than that. I genuinely believe that such a monetary system, separated from the government, can bring massive benefits to humanity, and I am willing to dedicate the rest of my life working on it, no matter what the price of Bitcoin Cash is.",41,btc,2022-03-09 06:53:14

takh9y,SoiledCold5,4,https://redd.it/takh9y,ü§î Opinion,Bitcoin Cash Idea - Merge Mining,"An argument we hear from Bitcoin Core maxis is that Bitcoin Cash isn't secured, it has low hashrate and can be 51% attacked. Well yes, Bitcoin Cash only has a network hashrate of 1.45 EH/s compare to bitcoin's 205.27 EH/s. But we recently saw with Hathor that merge mining could be a solution to boost the hashrate, and in return security. 

If Bitcoin Cash had a way to merge mine and the major pools adopted it we can see the hashrate skyrocket pass 30 EH/s. If you look at the pools that merge mine other chains with Bitcoin they total more than 60+ EH/s ([https://miningpoolstats.stream/bitcoin](https://miningpoolstats.stream/bitcoin))  

You can see a major example of Bitcoin's merge mining effect with Namecoin ([https://miningpoolstats.stream/namecoin](https://miningpoolstats.stream/namecoin)), 4 bitcoin pools merge mine with them letting this small altcoin have a hashrate of **133 EH/s!**

tcmuc9,OlavOlsm,6,https://redd.it/tcmuc9,None,CryptoWoo Flipstarter #2 - A seamless non-custodial and self-hosted payment gateway for WooCommerce," Our previous Flipstarter was funded in less than 10 hours. We delivered all the goals, as well as released a new website design and other improvements. The project has received so much positive feedback from the community, and the statistics on wordpress.org show good growth. Previous funders were also positive towards us posting our second Flipstarter. 

Please consider supporting our second Flipstarter campaign: [https://funding2.cryptowoo.com](https://funding2.cryptowoo.com/)

CryptoWoo enables WooCommerce users to easily accept Bitcoin Cash payments directly to their own wallet without middleman fees, iframes/redirections, wallet usage limits, or product restrictions. The cryptocurrency goes directly from the customer to the wallet and the payment processing runs on the merchant's own server. This makes CryptoWoo uncensorable, non-custodial, and decentralized, while still being simple to use.

The goals of this Flipstarter:

* For more choice and fallback when an API fails, add additional block explorer APIs blockchair.com, blockchain.info, haskoin.com, bitcore.io, and explorer.bitcoinverde.org. Additionally, support for latest version of the BitPay Insight API will be added, and any other instance of the Haskoin API or Bitcoin Verde API via custom URL.
* Add BCH double-spend proofs for even safer zeroconf.
* Add additional exchange rates API for more choice and fallback when one API fails. The APIs coinflex.com, blockchain.com, kraken.com, and gemini.com will be added.
* Show CashAddr addresses for merchants in wp-admin by default with the possibility to see legacy addresses instead, when verifying HD wallet and displaying addresses in order details. This will avoid confusion by merchants who sometimes have to contact support for help, and it will improve onboarding.
* Add an underpayment display in the checkout immediately when an underpayment is detected, instructing the customer to send the remainder. This will reduce support tickets to the merchants from their customers.
* Create a simple setup wizard when activating the WordPress plugin to enable an easier setup for newer merchants to get started. We've found the huge number of configurable options to be quite daunting for users both new and experienced so we believe this is crucial in making the plugin accessible for all users. During this wizard, we will highlight Bitcoin Cash in the setup wizard as a recommended cryptocurrency for users along with wallets like [wallet.bitcoin.com](https://wallet.bitcoin.com/) and [coinomi.com](https://www.coinomi.com/). During this setup wizard, we will only show basic configuration options to keep it simple.

The severe restrictions our banks and corrupt governments forced upon us. The Astronomical high banking transactions fees and the complete banning of online and global payment services such as PayPal and alternatives has completely cut off the Lebanese people from the outside world. Not having the ability to pay and get paid online

Now Thankfully with cryptocurrency, we (the Lebanese people) have finally a chance to be active in the global market for the first time ever. Exchanging payments with people outside our borders and opening up tons of opportunities for those who don't have access to online banking in countries like us.

For me personally, last Sunday I was admitted to hospital for a medical emergency and my bills were starting to pile up amid an economic crisis in a failed state Lebanon. Using BCH has saved my life for now, just the fact knowing that I have the ability to receive donations without restrictions let me feel more connected with the people outside and not left alone

Lately we have been in a difficult situation due to our limited economic resources, which every day do not limit when it comes to continuing with our project.

Our project has received gratifying support from the community, which we appreciate and this community is the one that has allowed us to save a large number of animals in serious situations.

However, today without resources and with a debt of approximately 1.3BCH pending for our last case, we are slowed down when it comes to continuing to provide help

Therefore we ask for your help, in order to solve this debt and be possible to have a fund to which we can resort for our activities for a good period of time.

For all those who want to support us with this and contribute their grain of sand in order to continue saving more lives every day with Bitcoin Cash, we thank you with all our heart

Mandy's surgery was a total success and not only that, her forecast is very good, being possible that she recovers more than 75% of her mobility in her paw.

After her surgery Mandy has presented a great evolution in her recovery, even when her hope was lost we did not give up and we managed to have her operated and we were allowed to pay the remaining 1.15 BCH to collect after her surgery.

Tomorrow Mandy will be able to start her therapies in order to recover a large part of the mobility of her paw, which makes us very happy as we continue to show the world how much we can achieve with Bitcoin Cash.

In the coming days we must pay the remaining debt, so those who wish to support us with this, in order to continue helping every day more as we usually do with our project, can do so through our official wallet.

In any case, the massive volatility took its toll on the derivatives markets and the liquidations for the past 24 hours surpassed $200 million, according to data from CoinGlass.

Anyway, such intraday spikes we see as a fake rise, so looking at the intraday chart, it still looks like a correction within a downtrend, so watch out for a bearish resumption ahead of the critical Fed meeting today.

EUR/USD and BTC/USD are connected and in positive correlation since November 2021. If we consider that EUR/USD has room for more weakness within an extended wave (5) to complete wave 5 of (5), BTC/USD could be easily headed lower out of potential bearish wave (4) triangle pattern into wave (5) towards June 2021 lows.

tfnqia,MobTwo,20,https://redd.it/tfnqia,üêÇ Bullish,More about the 4 multiplayer games coming to the Bitcoin Cash ecosystem.,"The first game is a multiplayer RPG (Role Playing Game). Basically, you control a game character and try to level up different attributes and find rare items. You can own a house in the game but lose your private key to someone else and that person can go into your house. You want to be a melee warrior or a mage spellcaster? It‚Äôs up to you. The game is heavily inspired by ‚ÄúThe Lord of the Rings‚Äù series and so you‚Äôre likely to encounter characters from the series. You will also encounter characters from the Bitcoin Cash‚Äôs Hall of Fame.

If you‚Äôre not the type of person to roam the world alone, then the second game allows you to recruit troops and roam the open world. You can build different types of buildings and setup your base the way you like it. The objective is world domination, like Bitcoin Cash.

If you‚Äôre too lazy to roam around the world and just want to go straight to the action, then the third and forth game allows you to create your own Kingdoms. Wage wars against other Kingdoms managed by other players while forge alliances with fellow Bitcoin Cash folks. Don‚Äôt like the Bitcoin Maxis? Request your alliance to go after their Kingdoms!

Hello community first of all we want to thank you all because today thanks to a donation of 0.69BCH received anonymously, we are very close to being able to settle the 1.3 BCH that we have of debt in the clinic for the case of Mandy, of which we bring good news.

Which means that only 0.61BCH remains to be able to terminate this payment and be able to continue working our project with more peace of mind.

Mandy has shown great progress in his recovery which makes us very happy and shows that his medical and physiological treatments are working perfectly.

Today her bandage has been removed and a great healing has been seen in her wound, keeping her away from any risk of infection or relapse.

According to medical forecasts, Mandy will have recovered 75% of the mobility of her paw in her first month of therapy, aspiring to the best result, 95% at the end of all her treatments, which is a gigantic achievement.

All this thanks to you and Bitcoin Cash.

tfqz5i,Thanah85,50,https://redd.it/tfqz5i,None,Bitcoin Cash transaction capacity should be a thousand times larger than Bitcoins,"Last night I was giving a presentation about cryptocurrency at a local church. They're doing a series on money and wanted to know more about this tech so they invited me in for a 90-min talk. Overall the talk went really well, I gave away a bunch of BCH, and lots of new people were excited about crypto at the end.

At one point I mentioned I don't use Bitcoin anymore since its tiny transaction capacity makes it not useful at-scale for anything in the real world, and that I use Bitcoin Cash instead because it has much more capacity. A smart person in the audience asked me the obvious question: ""How much more capacity does BCH have than BTC?"" I lean into capacity a lot when I'm explaining ""why BCH instead of BTC?"" so this is a question I get all the time. I gave my usual answer (""about 35x""), which was accepted and we moved on.

I cringe every time I have to give that answer.

Here's why:

tiny \* 35 = still tiny

\-----

Yes, I understand that BCH is right now operating at \~0.5% capacity. But the question shouldn't be ""How does capacity compare to current usage?""; the question should instead be ""How does capacity compare to target usage?"" A more relevant thing to say is ""BCH capacity is currently \~0.5% of target usage."" That feels like a real problem to me.

As someone who evangelizes for BCH on the regular, I want to have powerful responses to common questions. Even if we're not close to using all of the available space, perception matters. I want to be able to say things like:

""Bitcoin Cash can process more transactions in a single block than Bitcoin can in an entire week.""

And

""Bitcoin Cash capacity is 3 orders of magnitude larger than Bitcoin's.""

And I want to be able to create charts to share with people that show BTC capacity as a tiny single-pixel sliver compared to BCH.

\-----

It has now been 5 years since BU mined the world's first 1GB block on the BCH testnet, and last year we saw raspberry pis handling 1GB blocks on the BCH testnet. Why hasn't this capability been promoted to mainnet? Are there still technological bottlenecks to be sorted out? If so, why is that not the absolute top priority? I feel like 100% of everything else should take a back-seat to getting the main feature of the system (planet-scale decentralized peer-to-peer cash) to full working order.

I feel like capacity increases are rarely talked about during the BCH development cycles and when they are its ""oh we'll deal with that when it becomes a problem"" but that's the exact same mindset that resulted in BTC becoming crippled. Let's fix it BEFORE it becomes a problem if we really are planning to get to the place where it WILL be a problem.",38,btc,2022-03-16 19:37:11

Look at this drop in volumes and the lack of green yesterday's candle although the volume was large.

A correction is needed to pump the market more volume. Let's look at the facts, bitcoin can't get above the $44,000 level for over a month, and the local low keeps breaking new marks.

th2rfo,CryptoCryptonaire,23,https://redd.it/th2rfo,‚å® Discussion,SmartBCH is Useless - Change My Mind (or don't),"I've been using SmartBCH every single day since November 2021 and I have come to the conclusion that it is completely useless. There's literally zero real world use for it and honestly there most likely never will be either. Don't get me wrong, I love how fast and cheap each transaction is. Heck, even though it's slower on paper than Solana, Fantom, AVAX, Lumens, etc, my transactions actually clear faster on the SmartBCH DEXs than they do on the Proof of Stake ones. In fact, on Solana, Fantom, and Avalanche, I frequently have to resubmit my transactions multiple times. Anyway... I got side tracked and that's not the point I'm getting at...

I was rocking out a variety of SmartBCH LP farms as well as staking and I've come to the realization that if you get in early, you can make money, but if you're the average user, then the overall LP value will drop more per day than the interest you gain.

On top of what I mentioned above, anyone stuck holding the bags of the native DEX tokens once everyone else realizes they have a negative profit plan will be SOL. It's literally all about pumping it for a few months, cashing out as high as you can and leaving everyone else stuck with bags of trash. The entire premise behind these DEXs' native tokens appears to be to take your money, crash the value, and ultimately give you less in return. Plus, since the DEX's themselves are trading useless tokens, they will all end up folding eventually. You may not lose your LP, assuming they aren't fully scamming you, but once you cash out, you'll have a lot less in overall value.

Tropical.finance's DAIQUIRI token was worth .30+ cents in December and was worth .009 cents yesterday (A whopping 97% crash). They were supposed to do buybacks and burns regularly on their token to prevent this from happening, yet they've only done it once. Instead they're focused on the next get rich quick scheme, NFTs, where they can take your hard earned BCH yet again, then give you much less in return overall. I called them out on it via Twitter, and they perma blocked me for it.

1BCH's RBCH dropped from 0.000062 in January down to 0.000024 yesterday for an 88% loss. I've been tracking their auto sprinkler gains on a daily basis. Every single day, the interest gained is lower than the overall drop in price. Literally using any feature of this DEX will do nothing but get you a negative return.

Benswap's got a bunch of initial coin offerings or 'IBOs', but they're all completely useless and designed to do nothing but take your money then dump. Although their EBEN wasn't hit quite as hard, They did have a price point of .64 in January and .39 yesterday. As far as I can tell, there are no mechanisms in place to increase the price. The only thing they can do is add more and more trash to the DEX in the hopes that they'll get even more suckers to invest.

There is literally zero point in using SmartBCH and you're sooo much better off just holding and spending BCH directly instead of converting it to SmartBCH.",10,btc,2022-03-18 14:33:56

tjeewn,Oscuridad_mi_amigo,18,https://redd.it/tjeewn,üì∞ Report,"Lead ETH dev makes ""ominous"" thread about Ethereum. Complexity has increased the surface area for fatal bugs and the complexity has reached a breaking point. Simple scaling Crypto like BCH is actually the correct path into the future.","P√©ter Szil√°gyi (karalabe.eth) @peter_szilagyi Mar 18

Complexity is an often overlooked aspect of a system because usually someone else is paying the price for it, not the person creating it.

But don't be mistaken, someone is paying the price - whether money, time or mental capacity. They might not be willing/able to do forever.

As with scalability, complexity also keeps trickling unseen up to the breaking point. At that time, it's already past the point of no return.

Complexity also has the nasty effect of causing cascading failures. Overload people too much, lose capacity, leading to even larger load.

In #Ethereum's history, complexity never decreased. Every EIP is piling on top. Every major change (1559, merge, sharding, verkle, stateless, L2, etc) is one more nail.

I'm extremely frustrated when a research proposal says ""everything's figured out, it's just engineering now"".

As good as it feels that we're approaching The Merge, I must emphasize that #Ethereum is not going in a clean direction. Tangentially it's achieving results, but it's also piling complexity like there's no tomorrow.

If the protocol doesn't get slimmer, it's not going to make it.

I feel the root cause is the disconnect between the research and the dev teams. The former has to ""only"" dream up elegant - standalone - ideas.

The latter needs to juggle every single idea that was ever introduced, whilst surgically expanding the dimensionality of the space.

There have been engineering attempts to reduce the complexity (module split in Erigon, responsibility split in The Merge). Yet there was never an attempt to reduce the protocol complexity.

We are already past the point of anyone having a full picture of the system. This is bad.

I can't say what the solution is, but my 2c is to stop adding features and start culling, even at the expense of breaking things.

There are less and less people knowing and willing to piece together a broken network. And each change pushes more away. /FIN

tk357g,jessquit,10,https://redd.it/tk357g,None,Blockstream and Tether are primarily responsible for the fact that the BTC version of Bitcoin is an environmental disaster,"There are two key reasons why the reengineered ""store of value"" version of Bitcoin (BTC) are an environmental disaster

1. The ridiculous speculative value that is at least 100X overvalued has distorted the mining market causing it to consume over 100X more hashpower per block than should be expected.

2. The ridiculous small block scheme causes each block to contain 20-100X fewer transactions per block than should be expected

**The net result is an energy consumption per transaction that is 2000-10,000X more than expected.**

Yes you read that right.  2000 to 10,000 TIMES too much energy per transaction.

So we should be laying most of the blame here on two entites:

1. Tether (for pumping the BTC price artificially by some 100X over true market value)
2. Blockstream (for championing / forcing the small block version of Bitcoin)

Tether.  Blockstream.  Strange.  Doesn't one pretty much own the other?

tlxw83,Soft-Evening-7272,17,https://redd.it/tlxw83,‚å® Discussion,"Bitcoin just made its long awaited breakout, then went back down","I‚Äôve been hearing about this next breakout for the longest time, and I kept watching the market. It did indeed break out, then go back down. 

I know many people don‚Äôt mind waiting around a year or two for Bitcoin, but it‚Äôs really taking forever. Especially now that it has so much attention than ever, it‚Äôll be moving even slower. Every move up will be met with resistance. Even if it does eventually move up, which seems inevitable now, this next move will be taking on many months to make. 

Not everyone has the luxury of time to sit around and wait for the next move of BTC. Some people need to keep making profits and consistent returns. For those people, I would always advise they stay away from trading in general, as the fluctuations make it too volatile and the risks are too much. Go for staking your money or even setting it in launchpads. 

Staking is not as boring as slow as it used to be. Now with the emergence of new DeFi platforms on the rise that make it accessible and highly profitable. If you choose to stake your money in a launchpool, that money could be going into funding new projects that could some day moon. This would seem to be the next move in the main markets. 

The incentive within staking are pretty high, you get the luxury of time, where you can still do whatever you want while you lend other people your money, meanwhile your funds get bound to double within a few years. DeFi staking makes this more accessible than ever. Projects in the field like Werewolf exchange, on the Lycan chain, or any other dex, let you leverage your profits and multiply rewards. 

Not everyone could wait around with DCA on Bitcoin, as profitable as that may seem, and what works for you may not be the best solution for everyone.",5,btc,2022-03-24 04:44:18

CryptoWoo enables WooCommerce users to easily accept Bitcoin Cash payments directly to their own wallet like Satoshi Nakamoto intended with Peer To Peer Electronic Cash System. The payment processing also runs on the WooCommerce store server and these features make CryptoWoo uncensorable, non-custodial, and decentralized.

The goals of this Flipstarter include continuous improvement, stability, and usability enhancements, and we are going to make the onboarding process super simplified to ensure that it's not a daunting task to start accepting Bitcoin Cash in WooCommerce stores. We are focusing on optimizing user acquisition to convert potential users into real users. The addition of double-spend proofs adds another nail in the coffin for doubts on zero conf safety.

technology goes hand in hand with science, and Faith is not science.

&#x200B;

i have seen such absurd and unintelligent comments that surprise me, the most absurd of all is that for most of them ""BTC is the best cryptocurrency and the others are bad"", it is not, even btc is one of the worst and less innovative.

Without denying that btc in the near future could give a lot of profits, if they follow this maximalist behavior they are destined to fail.

I say this because they are few novelties, they are leaving security aside, someone intelligent cannot have that attitude without failing.

The United States and other powers are surely investigating to break it in secret, either for political reasons or for power, when they make known that ""Jiuzhang 2.0"" exists, the maximalists take unintelligent attitudes to godify the BTC.

This is a fatal mistake, if a government announces a quantum computer, surely they are secretly working on a 1000 times more powerful one, btc is not difficult to break if you have the necessary power. 

to survive we have to evolve, if we don't improve technology, it has an expiration date, here faith and godification are not welcome.

I even saw the fee amount fly by on the Ledger's confirmation screen, but I was moving fast and thought it was the change output. It was to be a small transaction, so I let my guard down.

Unfortunately, this was the result of what looks like a bug in a DeFi desktop wallet's libraries. It somehow generated a transaction for my hardware wallet which picked unrelated UTXOs at the address and spent them as the transaction fee. (The devs have been notified.)

tni39l,NickLibertarian,30,https://redd.it/tni39l,None,Ukraine Flipstarter Canceled - Why? Read Below,"Firstly I would like to apologize to anyone who has supported or had faith in my adoption mission in the UK, and now feels soured by this recent project.

I had good intentions to use BCH for a good cause, whilst trying to generate viral news about BCH.

It was an impulsive decision, I've never ran a flipstarter, even for myself. It'd be easier to just ask for a small amount of money for my own flipstarter to continue my onboarding adoption. But I'm not established enough yet. So this was about me generating attention and helping out, maybe a little virtue signaling I admit it, than making myself money.

However, I felt like since it's Ukraine, since they'd been donated so much in Bitcoin for example, we should go for a big goal.

I didn't research that the biggest Flipstarter was Smart BCH, and that no one had gone for such a lofty goal, especially without up front value.

Were I in Ukraine vlogging adoption there. Maybe it'd make sense.

Am I a scammer? No. What are my plans today now I've taken down the site? Going to a shisha lounge to onboard them to BCH and VLOG it. I'm paying out of pocket for the video. I'm not rich, I'm still going to continue my mission. I still love BCH.

This is a free community. I never actually scammed anyone. The moment I saw it wouldn't look good on me or others, I realized I had made a mistake and should spend my BCH on my VLOGs instead of a ridiculous flipstarter goal for something which in hindsight, isn't something that makes a lot of sense. 

That's it guys. You're free to use your own individual liberty to make up your own mind on me.

In the next few days, the largest animal event held in our city will be taking place, in which we are being presented with the opportunity to attend and have BCH as the protagonist.

&#x200B;

Together with our allies at the Nelve clinic, the only and first animal clinic to receive BCH, with which we have worked the vast majority of our cases. We have planned the installation of a vaccination and medical care stand on this day in order to provide help and at the same time generate an adoption of Bitcoin Cash in the city.

&#x200B;

This stand, as you can see in the following illustration, will have a large amount of informative and instructive material on Bitcoin Cash and its community, with which we will seek to attract a large number of people to Bitcoin Cash.

We will have 2 qualified veterinarians who will be in charge of providing all the necessary medical assistance.

&#x200B;

Our aspiration is the vaccination and care of more than 250 animals, which will be distributed during the 3 days of this day which will start on April 1.

&#x200B;

As you can see, time is not on our side, however this is an opportunity to show the world how much we can achieve with BCH.

Our goal is to collect 4BCH in order to meet the total goal and create the BCH STAND.

Because of Bitcoin's volatility, I decided to make something that predicts its price in advance. I've been working on a Twitter bot that does that since the beginning of March, and I just launched it three days ago. 

**How does the bot work?** 

In a nutshell, the bot grabs Bitcoin's last 528 candles and passes them to an AI model. Then, the AI model generates a prediction predicting the next six candles. Those six candles are in the 4-hours timeframe. So they represent 24 hours. (6 candles√ó4 hours=24 hours) 

**How accurate are the predictions?** 

I trained the bot's AI model on 131 different cryptocurrencies, which came around 80 years' worth of candlestick data. 

However, that doesn't mean that every prediction the bot makes will be correct. Like humans, the bot sometimes makes mistakes.

This project was jointly funded by the BCH community AVA Labs and E Cash. All three chains will have this DEX.  

The DEX will be structured quite differently to DEX's on Ethereum.  On BCH trading will use BCH as the base currency and SLP tokens.  

There will be no fiat or credit card services.  

There will be no website to go to this exchange it will be an app that runs on your computer. That way there is no third party. It will be peer to peer in its entirety. Chris emphasises it is a protocol not a platform. Protocols have no central authority unlike a platform e.g Coinbase.  

As a result, all trades are final, there is no tech support and no appeal process.  

Like a gun the DEX operates without considering the jurisdiction you are in. So make sure you understand the legality of using the DEX in your jurisdiction.  

As it is a protocol there is no KYC. The only id is your crypto currency address used for trading.  

Your trading partner could be anyone from any jurisdiction. Geolocation id is not part of the protocol.

In theory, transactions on a proof-of-stake network are validated by people with a financial stake in the network. But in most cases, the person with 2000 AVAX or 32 ETH will lack the skills and knowledge to actually maintain a node. Having a bunch of tokens doesn't make you a network administrator. Most of these nodes will necessarily run on a Linode or AWS instance, or something similar. 

Therefore, cloud hosting companies (ie, big tech) will ultimately control all proof-of-stake networks, for the simple reason that they are in the best position to reliably offer these resources at the best price. 

Imagine if the bitcoin network was all running on Amazon servers. I don't see how POS can lead to any other outcome. But am interested in hearing other viewpoints.",10,btc,2022-03-27 23:08:48

 In the next few days, the largest animal event held in our city will be taking place, in which we are being presented with the opportunity to attend and have BCH as the protagonist.

Together with our allies at the Nelve clinic, the only and first animal clinic to receive BCH, with which we have worked the vast majority of our cases. We have planned the installation of a vaccination and medical care stand on this day in order to provide help and at the same time generate an adoption of Bitcoin Cash in the city.

This stand, as you can see in the following illustration, will have a large amount of informative and instructive material on Bitcoin Cash and its community, with which we will seek to attract a large number of people to Bitcoin Cash.

https://preview.redd.it/7c7rftydd0q81.png?width=920&format=png&auto=webp&s=f06ae8b7be9662a56c960c413a7c0eca1764ee1c

 We will have 2 qualified veterinarians who will be in charge of providing all the necessary medical assistance.

Our aspiration is the vaccination and care of more than 250 animals, which will be distributed during the 3 days of this day which will start on April 1.

As you can see, time is not on our side, however this is an opportunity to show the world how much we can achieve with BCH.

Our goal is to collect 4BCH in order to meet the total goal and create the BCH STAND.

Be part of the adoption of Bitcoin cash.

Numbers: Between Friday and Monday, the price of Bitcoin increased by 7%. It reached a 2022-high price of $48,000 at one point on Monday before ticking down.

Background: It‚Äôs been a rough 2022 for most cryptos. In particular, Bitcoin entered the year at around $46,000 and dipped as low as $34,000 in January. The price has since gone back up.

Big Picture: What‚Äôs remarkable about Bitcoin‚Äôs sudden resurgence is that it is surviving other economic headwinds, including inflation and the war in Europe.

Support: While there wasn‚Äôt a clear catalyst for the recent surge in price, a few major United States banks have thrown their support behind Bitcoin in recent weeks.

In addition, it is so cool because now in 2022, you can understand the differences and problematic decisions that some companies took which made them fail and some that wildly succeeded.

trwc7e,1criticalcritic1,15,https://redd.it/trwc7e,None,Is Bitcoin Too Centralized?,"  

Not a dev, but I did read ""The Book of Satoshi"" and many of the works over at the Nakamoto Institute,

and I honestly love the true vision of the cypher punks and Bitcoin ... but it seems to me that BTC is  degenerating into Central Bankers v2.0

Mostly because in all of the papers I have read so far, all the arguments against a ""bad actor"" are assuming that the network is predominantly ""good"" actors which will make it unprofitable for any Bad Actor's scheme.

However, I found no arguments assuming that the entire network is owned by ""bad actors"" and it is the good guys who are attempting to over-power the network.

As it stands now, the expense of one miner, and power to run it, let alone 1000's of miners and power to run them; are far out of the hands of the average joe. Leaving only the wealthy to be able to control the network. And even the mining facilities that allow leasing machines is little different from ""proof of stake"" ie buying the network... which yet again puts the power into the hands of the wealthy, and soon only the Very Wealthy.

And who are the ""very wealthy""? The very same Central Bankers that already own the world.

It seems that this will only grow, because if it is not profitable to contribute to the network, only those who can afford to will... so it will slowly gravitate into the control of the wealthiest few.

Lately I see more and more ""big-names"" talking about how to incorporate banks, government regulation, and taxes... all of which is contrary to the crypto anarchy liberation that bitcoin was intended for.  It is disheartening to see so many sellouts.

But perhaps I am over reacting. What are your thoughts?  Do you think it is still Decentralized enough?",15,btc,2022-03-30 02:38:25
try97y,jackhippo,11,https://redd.it/try97y,None,Questions about btc scalability,"First of all. I love btc and what it stands for!  My question is in regards to scalability with adoption and the lightning network.  I am not a tech savvy guy, so I apologize if the answer has always been right in front of me.

Let‚Äôs say btc is on its way to mass adoption. And not only that, but ppl are even using it as they would fiat. I believe roughly 2000 transactions are validated on each block, and completed every 10 minutes.  This translate to 144 blocks produced everyday and a potential 288,000 verified transactions per day.

Closing out channels on the lightning network causes your transactions between two parties to be closed and  officially be recorded on the blockchain.  When you include hundreds of millions of new users using the LN, you‚Äôre going to get potentially millions of closed out channels per day (I‚Äôm aware that channels can stay open for more than one transaction) but many will elect to close channels immediately, for one reason or another. These transactions caused by closing channels need to be recorded on the blockchain. How will btc keep up with these transactions if it only does around 288,000 per day in a reliable manner or what do you think would be a solution? Thanks for any input.",6,btc,2022-03-30 04:27:41

IndyCar Series team Ed Carpenter Racing‚Äôs No. 21 Bitcoin Chevrolet has lined up at the starting line along with 32 other cars at the iconic Indianapolis Motor Speedway, also called the Brickyard, so named for the pavers that lined the course in its early years.   


ECR‚Äôs bitcoin sponsorship is among the latest examples of cryptocurrency mixing with professional sports. In March, Major League Baseball‚Äôs Oakland A‚Äôs announced the team would accept bitcoin as payment for season suites. Last month, the National Basketball Association Sacramento Kings Chairman and CEO Vivek Ranadiv√© said in a Clubhouse gathering that he would give his players and staff a bitcoin payment option.  


It's not so shocking that we have crypto involved in motorsports since they're in every possible industry now, that's how we have NFT powered games as well that work on principle play to earn, that racing game, more precisely rally game called K4 Rally is a good example of how motorsports implemented crypto in their industry in every possible way and they just started! Can't wait to see how things will develop for this industry in the future.

1- Avoid being a moralist if it is a topic that does not require it.

we know that your project is important (at least for you), avoid using language that makes you look like a teddy bear, or trying to play with the feelings of some.

&#x200B;

2- Explain what you will spend every penny on.

It is important that you explain this in detail so that the donors know how the money will be used.

&#x200B;

3- includes everything related to the project.

As an example, if your project is to rescue animals, you should not only say that, you should include the location of the shelter, what type of animals, quantity, photos where you plan to do it, if you are a veterinarian or not, contact addresses, website, legal permits , name of the foundation.

&#x200B;

4- do not overvalue your project.

Asking for more money than you need is frowned upon, be fair, if all goes well you could create a second flpstarter showing all your achievements and highlighting the next step and future goals.

&#x200B;

5-be honest.

If you're honest, not only will people like you more, but you'll also help Flipstarter be seen as a tool to help and not a tool to cheat.

&#x200B;

anyone can create a flipstarter but do not use it with the intention of getting easy money, the internet is like the modern god who sees everything, and knows everything.

I have not created a flipstarter because my goals are personal, I need 20k to buy a house for my family, this for me is the most important, but as a flipstarter it would be terrible, my problems are not more important than anyone else's problems, It would be selfish and ambitious, I don't recommend you do it, I won't, however you have the right to do it if you want, but if you do, be responsible and honest.",20,btc,2022-03-31 02:56:26

tsxlzl,CoatAny1468,0,https://redd.it/tsxlzl,None,Russian Legislature Contemplating whether to Start accepting only Bitcoin for its Oil and Gas Export to Friendly Countries like Russia and China,"As sweeping sanctions over Russia's war in Ukraine impacted trade, the country's head of the energy committee said the country is willing to accept bitcoin in exchange for oil and gas exports from countries like China and Turkey. 

According to translated statements, Pavel Zavalny said in a televised press conference on Thursday that Western countries can pay in rubles and gold if they wish to acquire Russian energy. 

However, he said, ""friendly"" countries such as China and Turkey are willing to accept payment in their own currencies ‚Äî or even in the top cryptocurrency. 

""We've been recommending to China for a long time that we transition to national currency settlements for rubles and yuan,"" Zavalny added. ""It'll be lira and rubles with Turkey.""

In the face of Western sanctions, many importers are increasingly avoiding Russian oil, driving commerce to bargain-hunting countries like China and India. The United States and the United Kingdom have implemented embargoes on energy exports, but the European Union, which is more reliant on energy imports, has yet to do so. 

According to Zavalny's comments, Russia has become more flexible in terms of accepting payment in currencies other than the euro or the US dollar, which are the major currencies in international trade.

While this would represent poor use of crypto as it would mean that cryptocurrencies would be used for war, it also indicates a further increase in value of the crypto community. Like the Ying must balance the Yang, we can only hope this bad doesn't eventually the good. This might also the increase in the use of new crypto like Crypto DAO and Polygon might see more usage apart from the Big guns.",7,btc,2022-03-31 11:25:30

I've seen a lot of projects that pretend to be enthusiastic when they really aren't. Also, you should have purchased some useful coins early on to benefit from the bull market while avoiding the bear market. Look for projects with compelling use cases, significant collaborations, and a strong leadership team when looking for altcoins with long-term viability. Always remember to do your own research, but I've been following along with this amazing project:

By efficient coins, I mean cryptocurrencies with a lower carbon footprint, which is significant given how much bitcoin and Ethereum emit into the atmosphere. The last time I checked, Ethereum used as much energy as the Philippines. Blockchain has been used in a specific industry in some cases. While not all of these topics are related to blockchain, some are important and have a significant impact on our society.

Don't worry, Ethereum supporters: I'm not going to mention a competitor. Solana is a town in the California state. Solana is one of the fastest cryptocurrency networks in the world, pioneering the development and use of cutting-edge technologies like decentralised applications and smart contracts.



It's even being considered as a possible Ethereum replacement.

Even in the EV industry, organisations such as bob eco coin, which donates its token to various causes and even uses EVs to reduce pollution, are assisting with a unique approach. These are some industries that I never expected to adopt blockchain technology in 2016 or 2017. Do you think it will have an impact on industries that move more slowly, such as metals and minerals, or industries that are completely different? I believe supply chains can be integrated, but do you have any other ideas for how blockchain could be used?

I'm curious to hear other people's thoughts on efficient coins because there are so many real-world problem-solving coins that trail meme coins in terms of market capitalization and popularity. Should we include some of it in our portfolio or leave it out completely?

We know that the minimum pledge of our Flipstarter campaign is still a bit high for some people  to pledge (0.4BCH right now), but many of you have told us you still want to give your support, which is amazing!

So we are announcing today that you can **pledge any amount at all**. We are providing a BCH address below where any amount at all can be sent to it. We will then forward these as a pledge once they reach the minimum for the threshold of the Flipstarter campaign. If we don‚Äôt meet that threshold with the donations I will top it up with my own personal funds.

Of course if you want to pledge directly on Flipstarter this is still possible right now at [https://hacksmart.org](https://hacksmart.org).

# Why Pledge?

SmartBCH is key to Bitcoin Cash‚Äôs new strategy for world domination, but it needs support to grow rapidly. We are hosting this event to pull hundreds of of new developers into SmartBCH and get them building exciting and useful projects. This will help kickstart the SmartBCH ecosystem.

Not only that, but the event will produce tons of buzz and content for social media to show how awesome BCH and SmartBCH are. The event will be taking place at beautiful venue in slap bang in the center of London. We‚Äôll even be inviting the wider crypto community to the prize giving ceremony and afterparty to show everyone what SmartBCH is all about!

So to put it simply, you should pledge as this will directly help grow the BCH and SmartBCH ecosystem.

# What happens to my pledge if the campaign doesn‚Äôt get funded?

Obviously we hope that doesn‚Äôt happen and are working hard in the community to make this great event happen. But should we not reach our funding goal, it will be difficult to send back donations (as it‚Äôs bad practice to send back to the original address a transaction was sent from), so we will donate all of these sub-pledges to EatBCH, which is an amazing project to help feed people in need in Venezuela. (obviously the main pledges directly on Flipstarter will not go anywhere since we won‚Äôt have access to them).",16,btc,2022-03-31 14:05:43

tt2giy,Rucknium,23,https://redd.it/tt2giy,üß™ Research,[Original Research] 94 percent of all BCH transacted since July 2020 is now a descendant of a CashFusion transaction,"Over the last several months, there has been a general crackdown on cryptocurrency user privacy. Today's vote on [stronger Know-Your-Customer (KYC) requirements](https://blog.coinbase.com/making-your-voice-heard-ahead-of-thursdays-critical-eu-vote-f03730e83e5c) in the EU is the latest example. For coins with a transparent ledger like BCH, the crackdown has [raised](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/sztwd2/bitcoins_fungibility_graveyard_are_bch_and_cash/) [fears](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/sljvil/comment/hvsga8l/) that regulations could in effect split BCH into ""compliant"" and ""non-compliant"" sets of coins.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/glazn214nqq81.png?width=1869&format=png&auto=webp&s=292af4bfefcb6da17f99caa93a8d97a602626056

CoinJoin protocols like CashFusion have been used to maintain privacy on transparent ledgers for years, but centralized exchanges are increasingly rejecting BTC that has been recently CoinJoined. I am aware of no credible reports of CashFusioned BCH being rejected from exchanges, but the question lingered in my mind: ***If exchanges wanted to completely avoid dealing with BCH that had ever passed through a CashFusion transaction, would they be able to?***

After deploying graph analysis on the BCH blockchain from July 2020 to December 2021 I can answer that: ***No, not as a practical matter***.

***94 percent of the value of the BCH unspent transaction output (UTXO) set created between July 29, 2020 and December 23, 2021 (corresponding to block heights 646085 and 719602) is a direct or indirect descendant of a CashFusion transaction.*** This represents 10 million of the 19 million BCH that currently exist.

## What is a CashFusion Descendant in the UTXO Set?

A transaction that spends the coins (i.e. outputs) of a previous transaction is a child transaction. And, in turn, a transaction that spends the child transaction's coins is the grandchild of the original transaction. If the outputs of a transaction can be traced backward in time to a particular transaction through a series of parent-child relationships, then that transaction is said to be a descendant of that earlier transaction.

The UTXO set is all of the outputs that have not yet been spent. In other words, the UTXO set is the grand total of all coins that BCH owners possess in their wallets, available for them to spend.

The figure below illustrates these concepts, using a fictional transaction [graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_(discrete_mathematics)) (i.e. network relationship) with various scenarios. The red circles are CashFusion transactions. Purple circles are non-CashFusion transactions that are descendants of CashFusion transactions that have already been spent at this point in time in this fictional scenario. Orange circles are unspent outputs that are descendant from CashFusion transactions.

The blue circles, on the other hand, represent spent outputs that do not have any CashFusion ancestors. If an output is unspent but remains untouched by a CashFusion transaction, then it is green. Notice that when blue circles combine with purple circles, their descendants are all purple.

[CashFusion descendant visualization](https://preview.redd.it/rwqydo0umqq81.png?width=960&format=png&auto=webp&s=3e67ebb69258f3f4697c12f80cd59b2fdecdc7d9)

In the figure, the total value of the UTXO set is the sum of all coins contained in both the orange and green circles. When I say that 94 percent of BCH in the UTXO set created in the last year-and-a-half is a descendant of a CashFusion transaction, I mean that the orange circles contain 94 percent of the value of the orange and green circles combined. Another way of describing this UTXO set is that these are coins that are in ""active addresses"" on the BCH blockchain.

## Caveats and Conclusion

94 percent sure sounds like a lot, but how closely related are these UTXO to CashFusion? The answer is: Not very closely related. I found that the median number of transaction separating a UTXO and its nearest CashFusion ancestor is 463. So if exchanges wanted to, they could still reject BCH that came directly from a CashFusion and still probably accept the majority of BCH.

It takes time for the CashFusion descendants to spread through the blockchain. I re-ran the analysis for just February 2022 and found that only 44 percent of the value of the UTXO set created in February 2022 was a descendant of a CashFusion transaction that occurred in that month.

Could this analysis be done with BTC CoinJoins? Yes, since the analysis code I wrote should be inter-operable with BTC. However, identifying BTC CoinJoins is more time-consuming than identifying CashFusion transactions, so I have no plans to conduct such an analysis at this time.

Frankly, I was a little shocked at my results. I didn't expect that CashFusion would be so well-integrated into the rest of the BCH blockchain. Of course, to some extent the level of integration is high due to how I've defined it: A descendant is a descendant no matter how many transaction separate it from its ancestor CashFusion transaction.

As use of CashFusion expands and [more wallets integrate it as a feature](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/rs4m44/pokketcash_cashfusion_beta_now_available/), will BCH become akin to Dash or Decred, which have optional CoinJoins integrated into their protocols? And therefore will centralized exchanges and services be forced to accept CashFusioned coins as a routine part of dealing in BCH? Or will there be a crackdown?

First off, if you're looking at my profile then you'll notice it's empty. I wiped my profile recently. I used to do it fairly often but I got lazy. Anyway, it's still me, I promise. I can sign a message using pokkst#12435 for anyone skeptical.

Anyway, Pokket.cash v0.7.12-cf14 is now available! This build is a **BETA**, mainly to test CashFusion, but it is also for testing sending/receiving SmartBCH.

This update features quite a few changes for CashFusion, and also has some fixes for BIP47 payments, and SmartBCH sending.

- CashFusion outputs now go to a new derivation path. This derivation path is: **m/44'/145'/2016'**

- CashFusion now disabled by default (for reasons below)

- CashFusion now uses Tor Project's Orbot app for its Tor instance. Tor is no longer bundled.

After using several apps lately that have Tor support, quite a few seem to go with this approach. This also means fewer apps would be fighting over port 9050 on the device.

Because the app needs to check if Orbot is installed, and so it doesn't automatically go to the app store page for it upon first boot of the new update (if it's not running or installed), then CashFusion is disabled by default. I hope it being disabled by default, then prompting install/run of Orbot if needed will make it clearer for people that Orbot is required now.

- SmartBCH sending fixes

- BIP47 fixes

The app and its CashFusion client seem to be a lot more stable now when using Orbot. I ran it all day yesterday and got about 10-12 fusions with about 0.8 BCH.

We‚Äôve got an announcement to make....crypto just isn‚Äôt that great. Traditional banks are where it‚Äôs at in 2022. Yes, yes, we know that Bitcoin Cash brings freedom to anyone who wants it, but who really wants financial freedom? Surely it‚Äôs just much better for the banks to look after our money. They definitely know what they are doing guys. Yes, they might sometimes block your account but they surely know better than us when we should and shouldn‚Äôt spend our money.

What we really love is when Paypal locks our account and all funds in it for selling a t-shirt. Situations like this remind us who‚Äôs really boss, and it‚Äôs not us. We‚Äôre too stupid and reckless to really handle our money so it‚Äôs great when they just remove that option from us without warning.

Those central banks are great too! They keep on printing money and giving it to everyone. What‚Äôs not to love about that?! Prices are going up everywhere for everything, so everyone must be making tons of money, right?

These CBDCs are also probably the coolests things we ever heard of. Money that comes with the controls directly built in?! Love it. We shouldn‚Äôt be letting adults decide how to spend their money. It would be so much simpler and easier having a handful of guys decide what we want and need. Why should we worry our little minds with free choice.

Bitcoin out, Gov coins in we say.

ttzarh,Oscuridad_mi_amigo,9,https://redd.it/ttzarh,üì∞ News,After just 1 month Gemini yet again raises interest rates for BCH (now 5.33%). Shorters are in lots of trouble due to the recent BCH rise. They might need more BCH since lenders might be calling back their loans.,"The interest rate is now 5.33% up from 5.12%

Current rate can be found on their website: https://www.gemini.com/earn


Screenshot of  rates from 1 month ago:
https://i.redd.it/qz1fa0wa0bi81.png

Thread 1 month ago when the price of BCH was around $300: https://old.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/sudgcp/when_you_short_bch_but_then_the_lenders_want/

At $380 , the shorters may be down at least 27% compared to 1 month ago. Instead of closing they may be doubling down and trying to pay more interest to get their hands on more BCH.

Why else are they paying 5x the interest rate for BCH, compared to the BTC/ETH/LTC rates?

If they dont close their shorts, they will probably try raise the interest rates over and over. 

If they close their positions, we might expect BCH to rocket up a decent amount. These guys are trying to borrow as much BCH as possible, and then still raising rates to try get even more BCH, so their positions might be huge.

tugjt9,Jicama-Brief,20,https://redd.it/tugjt9,None,"Are you a holder of BTC, you may not be allowed to do anonymous transaction in Europe","
The European Parliament has passed a controversial piece of legislation that outlaws anonymous cryptocurrency transactions, a move that industry leaders say could have unintended consequences.

The new European law is meant to extend anti-money laundering requirements that apply to conventional payments over $1,000 Euros to the cryptocurrency sector. The new rules also scrap the floor for cryptocurrency payments, so payers and recipients of even the smallest transactions would need to be identified, including for transactions that have no host or come from self-hosted wallets.

However, cryptocurrency advocates say that the new legislation will stifle innovation and invade people‚Äôs personal privacy. They also say that some unregulated cryptocurrency exchanges could be cut off from the global financial system because of the new European legislation.

National governments said in December they wanted to scrap the $1,000 Euro threshold for cryptocurrencies on the basis that digital payments can easily circumvent the limit, and to include private wallets that aren‚Äôt operated by regulated cryptocurrency asset providers.

This means that crypto trading and crypto copy trading platforms like Coinbase and Tycoon can't allow users to trade or send crypto to a private wallet if the wallet owner does not demystify their identity. 

The legislation passed this week was met with fierce resistance from major cryptocurrency participants and legal experts who warned that heavy-handed privacy violations could face legal challenges in European courts.

Members of the center-right European People's Party (EPP) opposed many of the more controversial changes, condemning what they called a ‚Äúde facto ban of self-hosted wallets.‚Äù

A separate proposal that‚Äôs now under review by the European Parliament would prevent transfers being made to ‚Äúnon-compliant‚Äù cryptocurrency service providers, which includes those operating in the European Union without authorization or that are not affiliated to or established in any jurisdiction.",39,btc,2022-04-02 11:17:27

tw8yh8,estebansaa,11,https://redd.it/tw8yh8,None,"Good news everyone, the KoingFu.com decentralized exchange is now ready!","After months of non stop work  we have multiple good news to share with the community! Our Uniswap based  decentralized exchange is now ready at [http://www.koingfu.com](http://www.koingfu.com) , while for our testnet we  deployed  the Sushiswap  contracts and frontend, for our mainnet we decided it was extremely important to deploy Uniswap instead. Let me share some details of why we did this.

First, let me just say what an amazing job the other teams working on decentralized exchanges are doing. Ben, Mist, Tango, upcoming Verse and others, are working on secure platforms and we are very happy to see them grow with users and volume.  We needed to wait a bit before launching our swap, as launching before farm incentivized swaps created a risk of them inadvertently doing a vampire attack on us. You can read more about vampire attacks here: [https://finematics.com/vampire-attack-sushiswap-explained/](https://finematics.com/vampire-attack-sushiswap-explained/).  Now that the farms are in place, and users had time to farm multiple tokens to a certain level of inflation the risk is low. We are trying to position our swap so that it does not compete with farms, but instead complements them. Is also important to notice in order for farms to work, farm swaps need flexibility on their token issuance, while in our case the issuance is fixed, so an incentive for users to move part of the liquidity to us. While we where very quick to deploy the Swap on testnet, doing so for our mainnet took a lot more care. We put in place  security infrastructure and practices to deploy the contracts securely, and creating a path to move from V2 version of the contracts, to V3 version as soon as the Uniswap license allows us. The technical and legal roads selected by Uniswap and Sushiswap/Pancakeswap are very different, and we believe future development of these projects will deviate them further apart.

There were  technical and  legal reasons for us to avoid a farm based swap like Sushiswap or Pancake swap.  As part of our plan, we have deployed our contracts not only on SmartBCH but on multiple networks, so that we can then bridge all the networks together and incentivize value to flow into SmartBCH. The extra complexity of farms contracts did not fit well with this idea. As for the legal reasons, we are following the same path that Uniswap took, farms increase legal responsibilities and stop us from being covered by prior Uniswap legal framework. Sadly a certain level of compliance  means that for now we are unable to provide service to the USA and other restricted countries, just as the upcoming Verse platform is also limited to. Thankfully there are multiple other swaps on the ecosystem that do not have this restrictions and can serve all countries.

We would like to thank all the community that supported us, if you contributed to our Flipstarter we will be gifting you our new token ""$Ki"" to show our appreciation for your support. We will be doing an additional post with details of our token Ki and how we are distributing it. Trading of our token ""Ki""  will start when this post is 24 hours, so that everyone can get a fair start.  Ki is central to our community, contracts and DAO plans.

We have done a lot of work on our bridge, after testing several bridge implementations including RSKBridge and Wormhole bridge we decided the right thing to do was to build our own. We will follow up this post with full details on our new bridge design. We are also preparing a white paper with a more technical explanation of everything we are building, and will share it as we move forward

The extra time allowed us to work on a few new things, our contract verifier is turning into a multi network block explorer. As we made progress with our multi-network bridge it became clear that we needed several tools that are not part of our ecosystem so we build them. The multi-network explorer is extremely important as it allow to access the information needed for users to validate bridge transactions. Following the same ideal of the SmartBCH EVM design, we have also done a lot of optimization work, you will notice that our contracts burn a lot less gas than the other swaps, not only on SmartBCH but on the other EVMs we have deployed to.

Again a BIG thank you to everyone on the community for your support! We are only getting started, have a lot to share and cant wait to show you all the cools things we have been working on!",17,btc,2022-04-04 18:17:54

# Let's Get HackSmart! Funded

We're almost there Team BCH! We've had some incredibly generous donations from some amazing BCH supporters that have gotten us very close to getting funded. A massive thank you to everyone who has already pledged. As of writing were at **305.62*****/*****425.00BCH**. That means there's less than 120BCH to go and we've got 2 and a bit days left to get it locked in.

We need your support to get us over the finish line. We already have the venue booked and deposit down, catering booked, furniture booked, and a bunch of other things started to spin up ready for the event. We had a big team brainstorm today and we're all super excited about how amazing this event is going to be and how big of a splash it's going to make.

# Reaching The Wider Crypto Community

We'll be inviting the whole London crypto community to the project pitches, awards ceremony and afterparty so they will all get to see just how much of a game-changer SmartBCH is for crypto adoption.

# Win A Ledger Nano S

We still have the competition running that one of the people who pledge will receive a Ledger Nano S (if the campaign is successfully funded). We'll pick this person out of a hat and announce this at the end of the week.

# The Blockchain Hangout London

We host the [biggest crypto Meetup](https://meetup.com/coinriot) in London which is growing every month. We had 240RSVPs last month and this month we're aiming for 300. HackSmart will be heavily promoted to our attendees at every Meetup leading up to the event and of course we'll be advertising the event all around London and online to make sure we get a full house of talented people attend.

# Sponsorship

If you are interested in sponsoring the event we have a ton of options available. Please just send us a private message here and we'll find a great solution for you!

# Let's Go

With your help we can get this funded, and then we'll get it organised and make it a huge success for SmartBCH, and by extension BCH!

tx6qiu,MobTwo,13,https://redd.it/tx6qiu,üì∞ Report,Final Bots Update,"This is probably my final bots update to share my findings. Since I had looked through more than a couple hundreds of these account history, I thought I might share some things I observed in the course of my work.

These are not AI bots, but most likely cheap labor from India. Here are the main reasons why I think so.

1) Once a while, I found them writing comments in Hindi.

2) AI is very unlikely to have the ability to differentiate normal threads from honeypot threads https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/ss0llj/important_please_do_not_comment_in_this_thread/

However, anyone with basic English reading ability will be able to avoid it. That honeypot thread was not able to trick the ""bots"".

3) It explains the poor and broken English of these bots.

4) It explains how they were able to write comments with some relevance to the thread, even if the thread is only a link or an image.

*Something interesting I noted is that many of the bots are only active in r/btc. I don't know why but that's my observations.

So then it begs the question, why are they doing this? I have some theories.

- These companies sell upvoting/downvoting services which you can buy online.

- These companies sell reddit accounts after harvesting sufficient karma.

- Someone is paying them to disrupt this community and undermine the efforts of Bitcoin Cash.

ty0rto,TheWorldofGood,12,https://redd.it/ty0rto,ü§î Opinion,Bitcoin Conference and the sudden market price drop. Crypto in general feels like a game of manipulation,"I saw a post in other subreddit that talks about how crypto market prices always drop whenever there‚Äôs a Bitcoin Conference. 

That got me thinking, why is that?
And then I looked at the crypt market chart of the last few days that kept going up and up until today, the day of the Bitcoin conference, when it finally crashed beyond 10 percent for most coins.

It feels like some seasoned investors are just building up the price and the hype for few days before an upcoming Bitcoin conference and then pull the rug on new and ignorant investors who were hoping that Bitcoin price would soar if there‚Äôs a big news announcement at the conference.

I also saw some fake news that talks about how Apple will partner with Bitcoin or something along those lines. I am sure that got some new investors jump in and bought a lot of Bitcoin when it was just a fake hype and fake news spread by some scammer to hype up the price of Bitcoin.

And then I see some other altcoins that are obviously rug pulls but new investors keep on buying because they believe in the fake news and fake promises (fake ‚Äúpartnerships‚Äù with big companies). That‚Äôs how it usually goes with crypto market in general. The price is driven by the hype of the false promises and partnerships. The promise that brings in a lot of money from suckers like me.

Don‚Äôt get wrong though. I think some crypto coins are legitimate like Bitcoin Cash that just works without fake news or false promises. Bitcoin Core (BTC) on the other hand makes a lot of promises but it‚Äôs still too slow and the fee is too high to be practical for normal people to use. 

The whole thing with El Salvador was just a big fake news that didn‚Äôt really work. The only true thing about BTC is that billionaires like Michael Saylor are buying it because of the false promise that the price will keep going up forever.

I think such mentality is that of a cultist and it‚Äôs time that some of us wake up and realize that most of the hype in crypto market is just a scam.",13,btc,2022-04-07 00:45:18

tzo0ei,jaimewarlock,31,https://redd.it/tzo0ei,None,Rescued by Bitcoin Cash,"Bitcoin Cash saved our Condo.

I have always wanted to report this story but delayed till our security upgrades were completed.

Late 2020, I decided to buy a condo in Kenya. I found a nice place in a gated community with private water, backup power generators, patrolled by armed guards (who work for us and are always polite - unlike police). Despite choosing the penthouse on the top floor, the price was only $120K. In America, this would easily be over a $million.

I sold some crypto and had the money moved to my USA bank account. That is when the problems started. My USA bank wanted me to come in and sign paperwork to wire the money to my bank overseas despite no air flights out due to Covid at this time. This wasn't a problem with ID as the manager knew me well, but this bank was always very stringent about the rules. This never bothered me as they were very crypto friendly though and even now I still have a good relationship with them. They just weren't willing to send the money without me appearing in person to sign the paperwork.

So I came up with a new strategy. I had two other backup bank accounts and could easily transfer from this bank to them. I also had a PayPal card. I would just transfer money to each of them and then use my ATM cards to withdraw, then immediately deposit in my local bank. While a logistical pain to go to the mall every day, I figured I could transfer $2000 a day this way and have the money transferred in just two months.

Turns out this doesn't work. My bank had a $10K monthly limit on local transfers. This includes transfers to Paypal. So basically I was stuck with just removing $10K plus $10k per month via ATM cards. At this rate it would have taken over six months.

I tried making a large transfer using Western Union, but that just resulted in my account being frozen for three months till they just randomly removed the freeze. I also tried depositing a check at my Kenyan bank, but they refused it.

At this point, I decided to use bitcoin (BTC) via Bitpesa. I had an old account from 2014 with them and even had personal contact information with people that worked there. I knew they didn't do the Bitcoin->Mpesa thing anymore, but thought I could work something out. Turns out, despite being located in Kenya, they can't do any exchanges in Kenya anymore.

At this point, I tried ""local dot bitcoin dot com"" using Bitcoin Cash. I started out with small amounts using the top buyers. Each transfer went smoothly. Eventually working up to the $1500 per transfer limit. Mpesa has a limit of around $3000/day, but with two accounts that makes $6000/day. You can transfer from Mpesa to a Kenya bank account directly on your phone, so you don't even have to leave home. Anyway, we had the rest of the money to buy our condo in just a few weeks.

TLDR: Fiat completely failed, Bitcoin completely failed, Bitcoin Cash worked.

Update: The site URL was changed to ""Localcryptos dot com"" since I did my BCH->Fiat swaps.",50,btc,2022-04-09 07:21:40
tzyvh2,that_one_indian_dude,10,https://redd.it/tzyvh2,None,Have SLP tokens losing their value in the SmartBCH world?,"A couple of days ago I made this [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/tk5o99/do_you_use_flexusd/) about flexUSD, where I asked 'Do you use flexUSD?' and the response favored the SEP20 tokens over SLP tokens.

I myself personally prefer SEP20 tokens where as SLP token kind hard to interact with.

Even before SmartBCH was a thing, the SLP or the Simple Ledger Protocol was the smart chain for BCH, with NFTs and tokens that came along it.

However, I had never brought any because I always found it hard to do anything with it since there was a limited platform and utility.

Then SmartBCH happened and being an EVM sidechain it changed everthing.

**The Impact of it**: on SideShift  there use to be a small selection of SLP tokens that you could have exchanged for different coins or tokens. However, a couple of weeks ago SLP tokens became 'Temporarily Disabled' and now they have been removed from it completely.

I still hold some flexUSD for the interest the wallet provide, which I had recently converted from SEP20 token to SLP of about $10 (Don't laugh, I am poor. Ok) just for the sake of it all. I have got about 0.5% back in 1 month as interest for now.

Now, apart from CoinFlex exchange I don't have any other way to change my SLP token to either mainnet BCH or SEP20 token.

&#x200B;

While this is all for fun and games I still wonder would SLP tokens still exist in the time to come?

Suppose if my $10 in flexUSD becomes $11  from interest would I still be about to use it?",5,btc,2022-04-09 18:12:24

Ethereum, on the other hand, has function as a decentralized-distributed smart contract network and this being its main utility does not require the expectation of the price increase. It's the store of value property of the bitcoin that seems to require it.If bitcoin's primary function is a Store of Value (SOV), then it's foolish to use or spend it, for transactions. Especially since it has a high cost to acquire it -- converting USD to it, moving it to a secure ""wallet"", etc. Therefore, I am not sure if bitcoin has any use for regular transactions and that its either a SOV or its nothing. And if SOV, since it doesn't earn any fees but has very high costs to maintain the network and would this require it to continually increase in value and faster than other assets for the premise to be valid.

Also then another issue is that -- the cost to secure the bitcoin value and the network -- should be directly correlated to its value or i.e. the higher the value, then the higher the cost to maintain it and if this doesn't come from transaction fees, then it needs to come from the ever expectation of price increase.   
It's an interesting dynamic. As the Bitcoin mining coin rewards decrease over time, it'll need to be sustained by transaction fees only, but if people don't use it for transactions, that's also problematic.",12,btc,2022-04-10 22:16:19

I was recently looking into scaling and noticed that the storage has gone really down, 10TB is around $260 on amazon. But my question is would this be enough to have a fully decentralized network if Bitcoin Cash starts to become used by millions of people every day?

If we see what's happening in St. Marteen there are over 70k people on that island, that could easily lead to 70k - 400k transactions a day. Which is easy to scale, but what if countries like lebanon who has a population of 6.8 million people? That could be 7 to 21 million transactions a day which could lead to several gigabytes being added to the chain daily.

u2v2sn,estebansaa,15,https://redd.it/u2v2sn,None,The Internet of value.,"Good news everyone, we recently tested our new bridge between SmartBCH and Binance Smart Chain, we transferred our Swap token Ki from SmartBCH to BSC, with what is a new set of smart contracts. While we initially deployed already available open source code for our Testnet bridge, after long consideration and testing a few other bridges, we decided to design and create our own bridge! On this and an upcoming post I will try to  summarize why we are writing new code, how are things going and what plans we have as we built the basic infrastructure to the **internet of value! We are pursuing this idea of being able to access any token, NFT,  DEFI contract, on any blockchain, with low fees and securely; what we are calling the internet of value.**

# Bitcoin Cash at the center of the bridge.

The highly scalable properties of Smart Bitcoin Cash, and its low fees create the perfect platform to make it the center of a set of bridges and tools that would allow for value to flow across chains. **We see a future where tokens and NFTS securely move across blockchains with low fees and high security.**  We see how in turn **PoW** based **scarcity** and **usefulness,** are the ultimate value generators for a blockchain coin.  Not all networks are the same, and PoW chains are the only ones we believe can be truly scarce. Consider how relatively easy it is to launch a new PoS chain, yet the same is not true for a PoW chain, energy sets a hard limit and creates real scarcity. Scalable and scarce, Bitcoin Cash is the perfect platform for the internet of value.

# Federated bridges

We had previously discussed how a Federated bridge works, if you will like to learn more about them please check our previous post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/osynga/lets\_talk\_about\_bridges/](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/osynga/lets_talk_about_bridges/)

Here are some popular Federated bridges, they all work very similarly to each other.

\-[https://bridge.roninchain.com/](https://bridge.roninchain.com/)\-[https://github.com/ChainSafe/ChainBridge](https://github.com/ChainSafe/ChainBridge)\-[https://github.com/certusone/wormhole](https://github.com/certusone/wormhole)\-[https://github.com/rsksmart/tokenbridge](https://github.com/rsksmart/tokenbridge)\-[https://xbridge.qbt.fi/bridge](https://xbridge.qbt.fi/bridge)

Many of the above bridges suffered recent hacks, the attacks targeted vulnerabilities on their smart contracts code, and API end points. Some of these bridges are trying to do a lot of things, have lots of moving parts and are very complex. In the case of Wormhole, they created not only a bridge but a protocol that allows any message to be relayed across multiple chains, while useful the added complexity may prove to be a mistake. We believe it would be better to focus every design detail on resiliency. Roninchain attack resulted in 600M dollars being lost!

A big disadvantage of federated bridges is that federators need to coordinate their actions.  This proved to be a challenge on our recent work testing RSK bridge and Chainsafe bridge. Not only are they difficult to deploy and maintain, but coordinating work among members of the bridge proved extremely difficult.

Many of these Federator bridges have limited  multi chain support, adding new chains adds complexity. For instance if you wanted to use RSK bridge to support multiple chains, you would end up having to deploy one bridge set for each one of the chains. Then coordinating the work among the different participants of the federation becomes an even more difficult task. A nightmare for any devops, and a security issue for the bridge itself.

Federated bridges  like RSK need several transactions to complete moving a token with minimal security. In this case, even while the platform is configured to always receive 5 out of 5 signatures, the high costs result in that there is always just 3 signatures, the other 2 are out of the picture for real world usage.

When things go bad for Federators, an it does happen often, lots of devops work required. This required work adds risks, coordination among the different parties running a Federator is often needed.

These are just some of the most notorious issues with the current generation of available bridges, there are many more considerations.

# Our solution, ‚ÄúSignatory bridges‚Äù.

Signatories based bridges share various of the same ideas that make Federated bridges work, but they simplify the components that make bridging possible .

Lets now go over how a token is moved using our new bridge. First the user sends the token into a  multi-signature contract that locks it. Signatories take notice of the deposits, once the deposits gets to a certain level of finality, signatories do their best attempt to make accessible a signed message certifying that a token is locked into the bridge contract.  Unlike Federators voting on the destination chain contract, a Signatory merely signs a message and blindly does its best to write to a website. The Signatory does not have any open ports, it is completely hidden from the internet. Does not communicate to other signatories  or even tries to call functions of any contracts. It works completely independently. It sees a transaction, it signs it when it is certain the transaction won't be rolled back.

Multiple Signatories running independently are signing the same transaction and doing their best to communicate it to the outside world. One or a few failing to do so, does not stop the transaction from being successful.  Our bridge is optimized for resiliency. A user is able to find enough Signatories signed messages corresponding to his deposit and put them together to form a claim.

The user then switches to the destination network and submits a transaction with the claim to the bridge contract on the other side. If the claim is valid the contract then mints or unlocks the coins/tokens and sends them to the user submitting the claim.

The way the destination contract knows the claim is valid is by checking the validity of the signatures. The contract stores the public keys of the signatories it trusts so that it can verify that the claim message was in-fact signed by the signatories.

This simplifies the bridging process a lot; there is no voting meaning lower complexity and much lower costs on the contract. There is no need for Federators paying contracts for each of the votes. Instead of multiple transactions, this signatory method only needs 2. One deposit, one claims. While at the same time maintaining the levels of security of signatories and even improving it. You will notice that it wont make much difference to have a 3 out of 5 signature check scheme, or a 15 out of 20, it would still only be 2 transactions.

Signatories are EXTREMELY simple, small code footprint, well-known cryptography primitives. Closed box, rarely will need an update if ever. Can be deployed in minutes, no open ports and can be kept under a firewall. Set it and forget it. No access to keys by Devops. The Signatory makes use of a docker container with an encrypted file system. Upon its first run internally generates keys and informs of its public key.

Notice how the only thing that the signatories did is they certified a transaction exists and is valid. Signatories did not move any value from one chain to another.  There may a time when laws may need services moving value to report on them.

Another big upside, adapting the code for non EVM compatible blockchains is extremely easy. Only the claiming contracts need to be rewritten. Imagine the same on a Federators based bridge, they need to support making calls for different types of blockchains. A lot more complex!

u2x3ss,Ok_Duck_4220,0,https://redd.it/u2x3ss,None,Bitcoin Sell-Off Deepens as Correlation With Stocks Rises!,"BTC is down 40% from its November peak, compared with a 16% drop in the Nasdaq 100 over the same period.

Continuing its descent on Monday, BTC briefly dipped below $40,000 and tracked losses in global equities.

Amid concerns about inflation and slower economic growth, investors appear to be lowering their exposure to speculative assets, including cryptos and stocks.

Gold, a traditional safe haven, traded higher on Monday, while most altcoins underperformed bitcoin in crypto markets. Ethereum was down 8% over the past 24 hours, compared with a 16% drop in THORChain, and a 6% decline in BTC over the same period.

For now, technical indicators suggest lower support at $37,500 and $40,000 could stabilize BTC's down move. And if the support does its job and provides the market with a bounce up, fundamentally sound tokens will be the quickest to recover. Plastiks, a project that lets companies tokenize their plastic recovery data for monetization and proof of sustainability; Avalanche, a competitor to Ethereum that prioritizes scalability and transaction processing speed; and Terra, a decentralized blockchain payment platform for stablecoins, may witness significant market capitalization growth when the major cryptos bounce back.

However, for now, it appears that investors have tightened their risk budget, which is typical during times of market turbulence. But with the globe realizing the real-world use cases of cryptocurrencies and decentralization, this dip is poised to end soon!",10,btc,2022-04-13 18:35:34

I already heard before and know some people who say that adding other traditional financial assets could balance the risk and stabilize the overall return. But here's what I've found out about this subject.  


We all witnessed that cryptocurrencies, gold, and crude oil are still on the capitalist battlefield. Bitcoin has piqued the interest of worldwide investors because of its exceptional returns that outperform all other assets. Crude oil and gold have done well in recent years as a result of their resistance to negative conditions.  


As the article says ""It's interesting how by combining these three key assets, the portfolio holder is able to defend him/herself from uncertainties and preserve value (gold and bitcoin), benefit from economic growth (crude oil and bitcoin), and invest in the future (bitcoin).""  


Synthetic asset project DeFi 3.0 Duet Protocol recently listed dXAU (gold) and dWTI (oil). Users may obtain gold, oil, and bitcoin which is already available on the site, allowing them to establish a portfolio that includes both traditional and crypto assets using a single crypto wallet. This all seems so interesting, I'm planning to do some digging and I will let you know.

[It‚Äôs heartbreaking to see crypto/NFTs destroy something I love](https://www.reddit.com/r/MetaverseOpen/comments/smb6ab/its_heartbreaking_to_see_cryptonfts_destroy/)

I started as a curious observer and I assumed, because of all of the big companies investing in the space, that there was real value.

The more I discovered, the more I was disturbed by what I saw. The more I looked into the [technical side](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1BiOcClgDVNESaPA3L7bYw?si=2f42603c53854d12), the less value I perceived. Time and time again I observed people were willing to turn a blind eye to obvious issues in order to generate a sense of hype.

Everyone was willing to believe someone else had figured it out but the closer I came to the emperor's chamber the more I realized that he was [wearing no clothes](https://www.bookbrowse.com/expressions/detail/index.cfm/expression_number/605/the-emperor-has-no-clothes).

A little compromise here, a little blindness there and the great deception is formed.

Where are the people of integrity?

If you don't know what I'm talking about I suggest reading:

[The idea that NFTs will allow you to take items between worlds is a pipe dream driven by ignorance. ](https://www.reddit.com/r/metaverse/comments/tz6520/the_idea_that_nfts_will_allow_you_to_take_items/)

Not only that I have noticed that artificial intelligence is being used here on Reddit to write articles in mass to promote the value of NFTs and crypto. It's the same article over and over and over again with synonyms changed. Then these posts are upvoted by bots creating a fake-news cycle supposedly supported by the masses.

However, the [more research I do](https://www.reddit.com/r/metaversestartup/comments/tjc6fk/as_a_gamer_i_would_be_less_inclined_to_play_games/) the less human support I see for this hype cycle.

Are we all just being led along by bots?

Why not just write each word instead? So, each day you check for your paper wallet, if it's in place then you're safe but what if it's stolen? Then you will need to have more time to transfer the funds from your wallet to another one. Storing the words in QR codes guarantees that it's not human readable, the thief must qr code scan each word to be able to unlock the wallet. This should give you some time ahead to transfer the funds (in case you are still alive).

evolution is all about discoveries and stuff..so do we want a preminer to make the next 'discovery' or do we want a fork from bitcoin to make the next discovery?

i think its an odds game so the more shots you take,the better the chances to find the next discovery..can bitcoin take that risk of allowing a premined coin to make the next 1 time discovery?

also this could solve the paper manipulation problem because who would want to hold paper bitcoin when your getting 50+ forks a day just dropped into your hand cuz you hold 'real' bitcoin

gold cant fork or allow ideas to fork from it..and look what happened to gold..it cant even keep up with inflation anymore

a bitcoin 'ecosystem' would be even much stronger and even more inclusive for everyone and i think the freedom people will want even more choice(for whatever reason) than just a singular path bitcoin where its price comes from the lagacy system and its idea creation so to evolve is not really incentivized if bitcoin stands alone

this is not a threat to the 'real' bitcoin..actually its really beneficial if bitcoin can cover 'all' of the ground of this new world and people are not going to just stop creating ideas

also a fork from bitcoin is likely not a security because its fair distribution but maybe depends on what its trying to do idk

also this would provide more competition for the whole miner ecosystem which is also good for bitcoin otherwise same thing those miners(home?) will take their moonshots to the premined coins and be supporting them instead of the bitcoin ecosystem",0,btc,2022-04-18 06:41:57

u6he27,estebansaa,3,https://redd.it/u6he27,None,"Pick two: fast, cheap, secure? Solving the bridge trilemma.","Good news everyone, this is the continuation to our previous post on bridges, here is the previous post. [https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/u2v2sn/the\_internet\_of\_value/](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/u2v2sn/the_internet_of_value/)

A perfect bridge between SmartBCH and Ethereum as an example, would allow anyone to instantly move a token, for a very small fee at no risk. At least with the tools that we currently have available, such a bridge is very unlikely to happen. Because of how blockchains work if you want a bridge that is very fast, there is a risk of a block reorganization creating an imbalance on the bridge, so you could choose to have a very fast bridge, yet it won't be secure.

Now lets say you want a bridge that is optimized for security, you will need to wait for finality, that means that a set of blocks is unlikely to be replaced with a different set of transactions, so in this case it won't be fast. Perhaps you can pay some kind of insurance on your transaction, so it will be fast and ‚Äúsecure‚Äù, but it won't be cheap. **Select two from, fast, cheap and secure, what will you want in your bridge?**  Would you mind having to wait a bit in order to get a secure transaction for a low fee? That is what we believe we should build. A very resilient and inexpensive bridge, one that is optimized for security and low transaction cost. Yet users don't want to wait, and there is a solution to that.  The bridge can be built with two layers. The first layer provides the actual token transfer protocol. While a second layer takes care of the final user with support, great UX, and speed in exchange for a small fee.

We have discussed before how that first **protocol** layer works, now let's go over how the second **service layer** would work. We already have something like this on SmartBCH: the great service of [https://www.coinflex.com](https://www.coinflex.com) and [https://hop.cash/](https://hop.cash/) will bridge a user BCH to SmartBCH and back. These services makes it possible by having liquidity on both sides,  to do settlement later using the current service of CoinFlex (that will be replaced by Sha-Gate). A service layer is not doing work directly at protocol level, but allowing users access to the protocol and charging a small fee for a great fast service and support of its users.

Users that don't mind waiting a few hours can securely and cheaply bridge their tokens, while those that need something quick can make use of a service built on top of the bridge. Those services can then from time to time put all transactions together and settle them with one transaction to balance their liquidity on the protocol layer.

&#x200B;

[Service layer and Protocol layer bridge](https://preview.redd.it/dsak1tq5ebu81.png?width=634&format=png&auto=webp&s=1a461bc900bcbf0d371922bb04f5c73a29726fd9)

But why do Signatories wait hours before they certify a bridge transaction?

## Vitalik discussing bridges

‚ÄúNow, imaging what happens if you move 100 ETH onto a bridge on Solana to get 100 Solana-WETH, and then Ethereum gets 51% attacked. The attacker deposited a bunch of their own ETH into Solana-WETH and then reverted that transaction on the Ethereum side as soon as the Solana side confirmed it. The Solana-WETH contract is now no longer fully backed, and perhaps your 100 Solana-WETH is now only worth 60 ETH. Even if there's a perfect ZK-SNARK-based bridge that fully validates consensus, it's still vulnerable to theft through 51% attacks like this.‚Äù

[https://old.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/rwojtk/ama\_we\_are\_the\_efs\_research\_team\_pt\_7\_07\_january/hrngyk8/](https://old.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/rwojtk/ama_we_are_the_efs_research_team_pt_7_07_january/hrngyk8/)

Vitalik would undeniably prefer that all value stays inside of Ethereum. Vitalik mentions this attack where a chain is reverted after the attacker bridges back value, leaving the bridge no longer fully backed. What Vitalik does not mention is that it is exactly this reason why transfer of bridges takes time. You see, the longer time a Signatory waits to certify a bridging transaction, the more expensive and risky the attack described by Vitalik gets.  So for example, if a Signatory bridge waits 24 hours before it certifies a deposit on the locking contract, then it means the attacker would have to be able to do an attack that reverts the chain 24 hours. Very expensive and risky for the attacker as his chances to succeed would be extremely small. The time no only makes the attack very expensive but allows for the community to be alerted on it, to stop it. But then 24 hours is a long time for a regular user to wait, that is why we propose a two layers bridge platform. As for the service providers working on top of the protocol bridge, doing settlement once a day wouldn't be a problem and would actually result in fee savings. We can then have the best of both worlds, a bridge that is fast, secure and with the right fees in exchange for great service and support. Notice that while we mention hours, Signatories actually look at block height, that is the number of blocks.

Our proposal for a Signatory built, two layers bridge, fixes the bridge trilemma, with a service that is secure, cheap an fast. **It enables a true internet of value where coins, tokens and nfts, freely and securely flows through different chains, and not a world of independent networks.**

We will be doing one more post on the bridge, on the next one we will like to share some details on how cross chain swaps work, and how we can create a series of incentives to move value from other networks into SmartBCH, this being our main objective.

Bitcoin‚Äôs been catching a lot of heat lately over its energy consumption. Article after article comes out that decry its harm to the environment. 

But the truth is far more comforting than a handful of seemingly harsh data points about Bitcoin and the environment. I wanted to create this post to equip every miner and Bitcoiner with the arguments they need to spread the truth about Bitcoin‚Äôs impact on the environment.

How could such an energy-consuming technology benefit the Green Movement?

In short, there‚Äôs more to Bitcoin than its critics appreciate.

**Bitcoin mining renders renewable energy sources viable.** 

In April 2021, Jack Dorsey‚Äôs Square released a white paper boldly titled, ‚ÄúBitcoin is Key to an Abundant, Clean Energy Future‚Äù. Early in the memo, the authors explained that the costs for solar and wind energy have recently dropped by 90% and 71%, respectively. Suffice to say that green alternatives are rapidly gaining steam on the cost side of the ledger.

But as explained above, it‚Äôs difficult to match supply of solar and wind energy to demand. Demand for energy peaks in the early evening, when people are home and using appliances. At that time, though, the sun is already setting, and wind is always unpredictable.

**Enter Bitcoin mining**

Miners can work from anywhere, so long as they‚Äôre connected to a power source and the internet. Because of this, they can act as ‚Äòan energy buyer of last resort‚Äô: whenever supply of wind or solar exceeds demand, miners can jump in and pay for the privilege of using the energy to mine Bitcoin. This will render renewable energy far more profitable, and will therefore incentivize the creation of *more* green energy sources.

Square‚Äôs white paper puts it succinctly: ‚ÄúBitcoin miners‚Ä¶offer highly flexible and easily interruptible load‚Ä¶and are completely location agnostic, requiring only an internet connection. \[They are\] an energy buyer of last resort that can be turned on or off at a moment‚Äôs notice anywhere in the world.‚Äù

**Bitcoin is one of the cleanest industries on the planet**

In 2021, the Bitcoin Mining Council (BMC) published the results of a voluntary survey that investigated the electricity consumption and sustainable power mix of about one-third of the Bitcoin network. They discovered that those surveyed used electricity fed by 67% sustainable power. The surveyors inferred that the entire Bitcoin network‚Äôs sustainable electricity mix had increased to 56%, making it among the greenest industries in the world.

In contrast, electricity in the United States is only 30.5% sustainable, and electricity in China is less than 15% sustainable. 

**Bitcoin mining employs energy that would‚Äôve otherwise gone to waste**

As Caitlin Long, CEO of Avanti Financial Group, said in a recent documentary, ‚ÄúMore than 2/3 of the energy produced in the world is waste energy, because it‚Äôs produced during the hours of the day when there‚Äôs not demand to consume it‚Ä¶it‚Äôs also produced in a place where there‚Äôs not transmission to move it across space and time, and so that energy goes unused and wasted.‚Äù 

Crusoe Energy and others are tackling this issue with bitcoin Mining. The company raised 128 million dollars in 2021 to build data centers and Bitcoin mining operations that use this wasted energy and reduce methane emissions.

Crusoe Energy operates out of North Dakota, where 500 million cubic feet of gas are flared daily. The company runs forty data centers that harness flared natural gas as of 2021. Soon, they expect to operate 100 units across six states.  

Co-founder of Crusoe Energy, Lochmiller, said that ‚ÄúWhere we view our power consumption, we draw a very clear line in our project evaluation stage where we‚Äôre reducing emissions for‚Ä¶oil and gas projects.‚Äù

**Energy consumption drives progress and so doesn‚Äôt require defending**

Professor Vaclav Smil‚Äôs *Energy and Civilization: A History* traces the relationship between energy consumption and human progress. To take one example, he explains that a typical 1900 Great Plains farmer employed at most 5 kilowatts of power to plow his field using horses. In 2000, a farmer couple can employ over 250 kilowatts of power with a diesel engine, all while ‚Äúsitting high above the ground in the air-conditioned comfort of his tractor cabin.‚Äù

Smil‚Äôs thesis aligns with our common sense. There is a reason that modern cities consume more energy than ancient villages, that airplanes consume more energy than horses, and that calculators consume more energy than abacuses. Seen in this light, even *if* Bitcoin was the most energy-intensive money ever invented, that does not mean that we should continue using gold and fiat currencies. A more comprehensive comparison should compare all of the costs *and* benefits conferred on humanity by each money. 

To critics of Bitcoin who appeal to its energy consumption, I ask: why is environmental impact the standard by which you judge an innovation, rather than the benefit said innovation would confer on humanity? 

If you are interested in ways of pushing this movement and have more questions regarding changing the current paradigm around Bitcoin mining and the environment, Sazmining, a renewable energy Bitcoin mining venture, is hosting an [AMA](https://investor.sazmining.com/ama-sign-up-page/) today at 1 pm ET.

1. The honey badger is Bitcoin‚Äôs unofficial animal mascot  
2. The maximum number of bitcoins isn‚Äôt really 21 million - In fact, it‚Äôs 20,999,987.4769 or thereabouts. It‚Äôs expected that the last bitcoin amount will be mined sometime between the years 2128 and 2140.  
3. You can run Ethereum smart contracts on top of Bitcoin   
4. Satoshi Nakomoto disappeared right after Gavin Andresen went to the CIA  
5. Bitcoin was used to circumvent the WikiLeaks banking blockade, to Satoshi‚Äôs displeasure  
6. Julian Assange later thanked the blockade for forcing WikiLeaks to hold Bitcoin  
7. Bitcoin is only used about 10% for crime according to the DEA  
8. The average Bitcoiner is a male European or American between 25 to 34 years of age  
9. The first recorded Bitcoin transaction was a pizza purchase (we're all remembering that very well lol)  
10. Holding Bitcoin, gold, and oil in a single crypto wallet might balance the risk and stabilize the total return, which is made possible by Duet Protocol.  
11. Bitcoin‚Äôs blockchain is beamed to the whole world via satellites - One potential attack on Bitcoin would be to shut down the internet, or take some action against the transmission of Bitcoin data over the internet.   
12. Since 2017, Bitcoin has had higher annual transaction values than PayPal  
13. The First Mortgage in Bitcoin Happened in 2019 - It was given to Brock Pierce. He spent more than 3,000,000 BTC on buying a renewed chapel in Amsterdam.

Only 21 million bitcoins will ever exist.16.3 million have already been mined and are being traded at the moment. I'm maybe dumb but can someone pls explain it to me, does that mean that when all of them have been mined or traded there are no Bitcoins left for mining anymore?   


As that article said, in the year 2140, the last bitcoin will be mined. No fresh bitcoins may be mined after that? How's that possible?   
I'm pretty confused right now! Are all currencies limited?  


I start buying for example Unicoins, but maybe in a few years there, won't be any left to buy?

Hello, I am a Physics/Neuroscience PhD student, following Ethereum for several years.

I interviewed Lyn, the mother of Ross Ulbricht. Ross built the first bitcoin-powered dark-web market Silk Road. This was all new 'criminal' tech at the time, and the US govt. sent him to maximum security prison for two lifetimes plus 40 years, without parole. But he still keeps up, and regularly writes about crypto and DeFi from prison.

[Part 1](https://rss.com/podcasts/room-of-lives/333530/) is a talk that I arranged Lyn to give at the University of Texas at Austin. She presents her view on the case of Ross and Silk Road, and the misuses of law she thinks the US govt. carried out.

[Part 2](https://rss.com/podcasts/room-of-lives/333531/) is a one-on-one conversation we had on my couch. Lyn shares her experience of Ross' trial, her views on US amendment violations, digital snooping, prisons and the drug war, and lessons from her activism. Then we talk about Ross the person: his upbringing, philosophies, affinity for eastern spirituality and meditation, and how he's been doing in prison.",40,btc,2022-04-25 14:56:12
uc10bs,AD1AD,4,https://redd.it/uc10bs,None,Bitcoin Out Loud Flipstarter update,"Hi Bitcoin Cash community! About two months ago my Flipstarter campaign was funded:

https://flipbackend.bitcoincash.network/media/screenshots/bitcoin-out-loud-flipstarter-february-2022_success_2022-02-14T070258.3477310000.png

The deliverables from that campaign were one fully animated explainer video, one video interview, one ‚ÄúBitcoin Cash Minute‚Äù video, and one ‚ÄúOnes until I‚Äôm broke‚Äù video (on my gaming channel).

I mentioned in the campaign that I can‚Äôt guarantee release dates, but that my goal was to be finished in two months. It‚Äôs now two months later and, since I‚Äôm not finished delivering yet, I figure it‚Äôs time for an update post.

The animated explainer video is coming along nicely, but slowly. It‚Äôs been tough communicating the visuals I want so that the metaphors accurately represent the technical details (or at least don‚Äôt imply anything that‚Äôs blatantly incorrect), and I‚Äôm being picky about it. I think the visuals are looking great though! Here‚Äôs a quick preview:

https://i.imgur.com/7cUktbv.mp4

https://i.imgur.com/cTpPCSs.mp4

For the video interview, I had a great conversation with Chu Mash, the artist behind the Reapers smartBCH NFT collection. He‚Äôs a California native who‚Äôs been making art his whole life, and he‚Äôs keen on providing value for the community that has grown up around his Reapers NFT‚Äôs, and around himself as an artist. Check it out!

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqRvLvf1PgU

The ‚ÄúBitcoin Cash Minute‚Äù video has been recorded and is currently being edited/animated. The title is BTC is NOT a good ‚Äústore of value‚Äù, which I hope will turn some heads =)

Finally, I‚Äôve made several attempts to record the ‚ÄúOnes until I‚Äôm broke‚Äù video, but the logistics of getting someone else playing the game to accept some BCH have made it difficult. Copy/paste is not possible in chat, and links typed into chat are not clickable. ~50% of players can‚Äôt chat at all because they are on console. Asking for emails or other contact info is usually a 1-way ticket to ‚Äúf u scammer‚Äù town, if they haven't already assumed I'm a scammer since I'm talking about crypto =P (I should have seen this coming since my first ‚ÄúOne‚Äôs until I‚Äôm broke‚Äù video was mostly spent finding someone who would respond and was actually interested, but I figured I could make it work.)

Currently, I‚Äôm unsure how I‚Äôll proceed for this last deliverable. Long term, I‚Äôd like to transition to hosting Rocket League tournaments with a Bitcoin Cash prize pool so I can coordinate outside of the game by default. For this campaign, I will make sure to deliver on the original intent of the deliverable, if not exactly a ‚ÄúOne‚Äôs until I‚Äôm broke‚Äù video.

Thanks again for all of your support!",25,btc,2022-04-26 01:29:12

Right now, at May 2022, perhaps they deliver the post consensus, or not ...

Who cares tho?

Since last year XEC's price has been maintained by a couple whales that got caught up with low liquidity bags they try to offload from time to time with low volume pumps no one is buying.

As expected, no fresh developers joined that coin, ZILCH... only a small cabal of maintainers that copy paste commits from BTC repos contribute some code.

For their GNC, they hand picked applications and only disclosed pre prepared matters to be voted, so the ""hodlers vote"" has been a big fraudulent lie.

And now they are starting the whole purpose of the fork and the IFP: to distribute money to their friends under the guise of development. 

Virtually all projects in XEC have been re-inventing the wheel that is been done already ages ago. Like web wallets (LOL), and a very short list of one or two more things.

Right now, they are at the second ""project"" being funded. Those are completely unrelated to the fork and are useless projects that some neckbeard friendly dev invented and the *""GNC"" already had skewed to be approved*. The projects have zero importance to anything.

ud2sg2,Livid_Toe_721,5,https://redd.it/ud2sg2,None,Bitcoin price looks like a scalpers market; here are the levels to be aware of,"Bitcoin's price may rise to $44,000 in order to complete a head and shoulders pattern. On the daily chart, the BTC price is printing a bullish hammer. A breach of less than $36,400 is considered invalid.

The price of what is the most valuable crypto over the likes of Ethereum, Ripple and Quint may experience a countertrend rally. Wave C of B might be impulsive as the dangerous countertrend move unfolds. 

The price of bitcoin may rise and then fall. 

The Bitcoin price may continue to deceive traders, as Smart Money has successfully conducted a liquidity hunt for the second Monday in a row. Traders attempting to short bitcoin were likely locked in a $33,000 loss due to the BTC price. The price of Bitcoin may continue to rise in order to liquidate as many short traders as possible.

After today's fakeout, bitcoin is trading at $40,166. If market conditions continue unchanged for the following several hours, the bulls will have formed a bullish hammer candle, potentially signaling the start of a fresh uptrend surge for Bitcoin. After today's trading session, the volume indicator profile appears to be pointing to bullish price action.

In light of the present downturn, a probable bull run to $44,000 would complete a classic head and shoulders pattern. The rising rally would be designated wave C of B inside the pattern, so traders should keep it in mind. As a result, once the target is attained, stronger drops may occur. Nonetheless, it's advisable to approach this trading idea cautiously. 

A breach below $36,400 invalidates the short-term bullish thesis, implying a 1-1 setup for traders looking for the $44,000 goal. If the bears manage to pass $36,400, the next bearish target would be $33000, implying a decline of up to 17% from the present Bitcoin price.",5,btc,2022-04-27 12:48:56

My take aways:So far this year brought continued stagnation and depression in most regards, based on the charts it seems BTC loyal SHA256 miners and market manipulators have been heavily suppressing the price in the first months as hashrate rises and value transacted coincided with degrading value, this later seem to have scaled down. I believe the price suppression worked and successfully steered away interest in the network generally. A big contributing factor is that the crypto markets still lack any fundamentals currently, most interest comes from price speculators with 0 interest in fundamentals and utility. Overall we need to do much better to break out from this trend and decoupling from the shit-show.

Enjoy! Tips are welcome. :)

**tl'dr: Why is there still no trusted (authority / service / portal) to verify that the current smart contracts, holding 10s of millions of dollars, are actually doing what they say they're doing??**

Blockchair took over from my favorite BCH explorer ([explorer.bitcoin.com](https://explorer.bitcoin.com)) and they're doing a fantastic job üëè üëç Absolutely, no complaints. However, SmartBCH is sorely lacking when it comes to a comparable utility.

I congratulate Jay on doing a wonderful job of building, deploying and growing his (community-funded) block explorer ([smartscan.cash](https://smartscan.cash)); especially since it's 100% completely open source ([https://github.com/jay-bch/smartbch-explorer](https://github.com/jay-bch/smartbch-explorer)). I plan to take a deep dive into the code very soon, and would very much love to know the ROADMAP of what's next for this project..

Just my TOP3 ideas for what I feel is currently missing from smartscan:

1. Contract verification & related dev tools
2. Network summary on the homepage (price, marketcap, # txs, fees, basic chart(s), etc)
3. Timestamps / Age (shown on lists) is very sorely missed üòû

So why not just clone Etherscan or the many other EVM explorers full of robust features? Answer: They're NOT opensource. Here is an issue ([https://github.com/smartbch/smartbch/issues/44](https://github.com/smartbch/smartbch/issues/44)) that best explains it.

Fwiw, I've started developing a set of tools (packaged into a web portal) to fill some of the gaps that I feel are most critical to the safety and security of the several SmartBCH projects I'm currently working on. So, I'd really love to hear thoughts & ideas, from the community, about what the best approach should be to **solving this ""trust/verify"" issue**, in a way that benefits EVERYONE! üôå

Hundreds of people from both Venezuela and international tourists visit Galip√°n to disconnect from the city and thus be able to have closer contact with nature.

Galipan is a small town located on the northern slope of Cerro el √Åvila (currently called ""Waraira Repano""), specifically in the Macuto parish of La Guaira state, Venezuela. It is famous for its flower farms, restaurants and very picturesque inns. It is a perfect destination to share with family or friends, and thus be able to enjoy the wonderful cold weather that is difficult to achieve in the city.

""Recorriendo Galip√°n"" is in charge of organizing tourist trips and transfers in said locality, and also offering transportation service for those who require it, at incredible prices. Today Deysi Oropez, the CEO of this venture, decided to join the free economy and take a step forward in her town, saying YES to the adoption of Bitcoin Cash within her tourist packages and services.

This is hard work that the BCH Latam team is doing in Venezuela and that it intends to expand to more Latin American countries in 2022.

Do people still do test spends before they commit thousands or even millions to an address? If I were moving some bank$roll, I would not only test spend to the new address, but also test spend from it. But with the BTC fees and backlog, it just isn't practical.

I didn't know about everything that had gone on with bitcoin and bitcoin cash until I watched a few Roger Ver videos. After hearing both sides of the argument, I have to side with Satoshi's original vision. Which in this timeline, means bitcoin cash. I do have a few questions though:

1. How powerful did the computers need to be in order for the smaller block-size guys to be happy? They wanted everyone and their dog to be able to run a node, but they couldn't because you couldn't do it on dial up and a potato PC. If you wanted larger blocks anyway. So what kind of computer did you have to have for larger block sizes? 
2. What does the road forward look like for bitcoin cash? I think it's safe to say that after the split, we got reset back to 2009 or 2010. Bch had to start the long road forward to mass adoption just like bitcoin did. It will probably be a bit longer now. And love him or hate him, I think Richard Heart is right about something - They really should have cut the mount Gox trustee out of the aidrop for BCH. And a few others. Because all they'll ever do is dump on you. But one day they'll be out of money to dump at least.

The exchange filed a motion in a Texas court to be exempted from the $8 million lawsuit, claiming that it isn't subject to the Texas court's jurisdiction. 

Divya Gadasalli filed a federal lawsuit, alleging that Binance failed to do its job in stopping the scammers. She claims she lost digital assets she bought on Coinbase (NASDAQ: COIN) to scammers, and she feels Binance, Poloniex (which is now controlled by TRON founder Justin Sun), and American banks TD Bank and Abacus Federal Savings Bank should be held responsible. She is demanding $8 million from the defendants.

According to Law360, Binance, the largest cryptocurrency platform and the home to blockchain projects like DAODAO and Faith Tribe has fought back. The plaintiff's complaints were based on ""paper-thin statements,"" according to the conversation, and she had failed to establish a claim. 

Binance further claimed that because it does not operating in the United States, it is outside of the Texas court's jurisdiction. It claimed that because it was a foreign entity, it was immune from local Texan civil laws. 

Binance Global, the company behind the tumultuous exchange, does not operate in the United States. However, it continues to provide services to Americans through its subsidiary, Binance.US, which has been embroiled in controversy over issues ranging from former Comptroller of the Currency Brian Brooks' strange resignation to another former CEO's disappearance for months now after leaving her position at the exchange.

Scammers pretend to establish an emotional connection with their victims before enticing them to deliver digital assets or invest in a shady company. Since the pandemic began, romantic frauds have increased by 40%, according to Action Fraud in the United Kingdom.

udx6xt,JuliaAthena578,2,https://redd.it/udx6xt,None,Bitcoin in 401(k) becomes reality for more workers,"Retirement giant Fidelity says it has launched a way for US workers to put some of their 401(k) directly in Bitcoin.

As cryptocurrencies and blockchain projects like DAODAO and Nature Vault gain traction in the mainstream, more US workers may soon be allowed to invest some of their 401(k) retirement funds in Bitcoin. 

Fidelity Investments announced on Tuesday that employees will be able to invest up to 20% of their 401(k) savings and contributions directly in Bitcoin, all from the account's primary menu of investment options. Fidelity claims to be the first in the market to accept such investments without going through a separate brokerage window, and it has already signed up one company who will implement the service later this year.

Given the widespread worries about the riskiness of cryptocurrencies, Fidelity's offering may be one of only a few for a long. The US authorities urged the retirement industry last month to take ""great caution"" when undertaking something like this, citing fears that inexperienced investors may not understand how volatile cryptocurrency can be, among other things.

In the previous year, Bitcoin saw five days in which it fell by at least 10%. Meanwhile, the S&amp;P 500 has only experienced two such declines in the last 50 years. Aside from its volatility, there's still a lot of debate about how much a Bitcoin is worth, whether it's even worth anything at all. 

Some investors may believe in all of Bitcoin's benefits, but they still prefer not to have to create a new account to buy it, learn how to store it, or deal with taxes on gains achieved in the years leading up to retirement. Or, as Dave Gray, Fidelity Investments' head of workplace retirement solutions and platforms, put it, they might come around to that belief soon, and Fidelity wanted to be prepared.

Cryptocurrencies, according to proponents, can improve returns in a well-diversified portfolio while reducing risk. That's because cryptocurrencies haven't always moved in lockstep with equities and other investments, despite the fact that they have done so in recent months on concerns about increasing interest rates.",7,btc,2022-04-28 15:08:48

A seed phrase is a string of words generated by your bitcoin wallet and used to gain access to the crypto linked with it. 

Analysts estimate that at least 20% of all Bitcoin has been lost, with the majority of those funds being irreversibly lost. 

According to recent study from CryptoAssetRecovery.com, Bitcoin, the most valuable crypto over the likes of Ethereum, Ripple, Quint and so on will lose between $272 million and $545 million this year.

""However, this does not include Bitcoin lost as a result of frauds or theft; while such monies are lost to the original wallet holder, they are not lost to the total Bitcoin money supply."" According to the article, ""those funds will most certainly continue to circulate."" 

People also transmit crypto to a burn address or to an address on a different network mistakenly (or occasionally purposely) and lose it. 

Every 10 minutes, a new Bitcoin block reward is produced, and the block reward in 2022 is 6.25 Bitcoin. In 2024, the block reward will be halved once more, to 3.125 BTC per block reward.

""Since there are 525,600 minutes in a year, and a block reward is issued every 10 minutes, 52,560 block rewards or 328,500 BTC will be issued in 2022,"" the report noted.

""It's evident that the vast bulk of the 3.8 million Bitcoins lost were lost early in the blockchain's history, before it had any economic worth."" 

Given that 2-4 percent of the 328,500 Bitcoin mined in 2022 is likely to be lost, this means that between 6,570 and 13,140 Bitcoin will be lost. 

""At $41,500, this indicates that between $272 million and $545 million in Bitcoin alone is expected to be removed from the Bitcoin money supply in 2022,"" according to the research.

True cryptocurrencies suffer from the double-edged sword of decentralization as much as benefit from it. One of the biggest advantages of crypto tokens with centralized developers (BTC) and a small number of large ""whale"" holders (ETH) is that they have the incentive to promote their investment.

&#x200B;

A user of a truly decentralized cryptocurrency has a low incentive to fund development or advertise to others because they will benefit relatively little for the cost.¬†

&#x200B;

One solution to this is a community funded advertising platform where any money donated to an address will be tracked and used directly on advertising for Bitcoin Cash. I hope that someday a process like this could be fully automated wherein users vote for the advertisements to be shown based on how much they've donated to do to the address. Anybody would be able to submit an ad and anyone else can donate to have that ad published.

Right now there is no perfect platform to do this but the website, a - A d s . c o m is set up so that once the ads are submitted it generates a deposit address which is automatically spent to fund the ads. I think given time and effort something like this would be a great option for a Bitcoin cash decentralized organization but for now would be fully dependent on a third party advertising platform.

Generally higher prices is the same as lower money value.

Inflation moves resources from the value creating public to the people near the money
spigot. It prioritizes spending and diminishes savings. It destroys capital which is

uf0q1b,estebansaa,5,https://redd.it/uf0q1b,None,How to create a token on SmartBCH the easy way!,"Hi everyone, so here is a quick guide on how you can deploy a token on SmartBCH the easy way with some basic level of security.

I will strongly suggest you use a virtual machine inside your computer to  improve your security. Keep an updated backup of the virtual machine by copying its files to a flash drive or similar from time to time. Install a secure OS like Debian. The steps bellow assume you are using a virtual machine, but will work just fine if you dont.

The next step is to install Metamask, and configure SmartBCH.  You can get Metamask from here:[https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/metamask/nkbihfbeogaeaoehlefnkodbefgpgknn?hl=en](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/metamask/nkbihfbeogaeaoehlefnkodbefgpgknn?hl=en)and you can configure SmartBCH by using this site:[https://chainlist.org/](https://chainlist.org/)Search for SmartBCH and follow the instructions to add it to your Metamask.

Now that you have Metamask installed and configured, is time to fund your wallet. You can use [Coinflex.com](https://Coinflex.com) or [https://hop.cash/](https://hop.cash/) , to move some BCH into your wallet. Also ask around maybe some one can share some for your tests.

Ok, so at this point you have a safe work environment and a wallet with some BCH.

Next Step go to:[https://remix.ethereum.org/](https://remix.ethereum.org/)

&#x200B;

You will see this:

https://preview.redd.it/3y0au1dvgkw81.png?width=1596&format=png&auto=webp&s=1a7f0345dc1839aec0a7eaca7a9122fab5ee3653

Now right click over the contracts folder, click new file and write MyToken.sol, you will get this:

&#x200B;

[MyToken.sol](https://preview.redd.it/mrerjbk2hkw81.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=fc592cb1a788e88be485e029bc411eec87f4d509)

Now we need to add the code that will mint your token! We will be creating the most basic token possible, enter this code on the main section:

`pragma solidity ^0.8.4;import ""@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol"";contract MyToken is ERC20 {constructor() ERC20(""Lucky"", ""Lucky"") {_mint(msg.sender, 21000000 * 10 ** decimals());}}`

it will look like this:

Try changing the name of the token, and the number of tokens on the code. Example change Lucky, for MoonLambo, and the ticker to mlb. Change the number of tokens, do you want 21million? change it to a trillion so you can be a Lambo trillionaire already.

&#x200B;

Ok, so now your code is ready! and you are ready to go to the moon! Now we are going to send this code into the SmartBCH blockchain, but first we need to compile the code, so do this:

I have been using them since 2018, fully KYC\`\`\`\`\`\`\`'ed. About two weeks ago, my account got ""un-kyc"" and needed to KYC again.

I opened a ticket with them asking why. 

The first reply I got is the following.

>Greetings from CoinPayments. Hope you are having a great day.

>‚ÄãI am reaching out about the query regarding your KYC. I would like to inform you, your uploaded proof of address was rejected due to unacceptable date of issue. The uploaded proof of identity was rejected as your identity document has expired and can't be used for verification.

>  
>‚ÄãThe document must be an original or PDF document. You cannot upload screenshots or modified images. 

‚ÄãNow, of course the uploaded proof of identify is expired. Because I uploaded them years ago. 

So I asked them if they where the policy that they require continuous KYC.

>Hi there,

>Thanks for writing in.

Of course, they dodged the question about policy.

The next reply gets more ridiculous.

>This is in reference to your previous response. After reviewing your logs, I see that a new account with User ID: XXXXX was created by you.

Wait... there is no ""new account"" in question here. **The other account I opened was for another business and KYC'ed years ago as well.**

>Thank you for your message.

Of course, both IDs and the selfie is the same. I'm the same person.

More bullshit...

>Thank you for your response and sorry for the delayed response.  
>  
>‚Äã‚ÄãI would like to reiterate that in order to verify your KYC submission, we would require a valid Proof of address issued within the last 3 months.

I replied, my account was verified already.

So I decided to ask them when I submitted the proof.

I asked them when my document was uploaded.

>Thank you for writing back,

>‚ÄãUpon checking our records, I can see that you uploaded the documents on xxxx. However, as of (2 weeks ago), your license has expired as a result you are required to re-verify your KYC. As a result, I'd request you to upload or send us here valid documents as mentioned below:

As I ask them again. Where is the policy in the terms of service that I need to continuously KYC myself.

>Thank you for writing back.  
>  
>Please be informed that due to security concerns we require the most recent document that is not expired. Because our system identified that your driving license expired on 14/04/2022, we recommend that you upload new documents in accordance with the requirements so that we can re-verify your account and complete your KYC.

That's all to my rant.

**TLDR: Coinpayment saw my Proof of Identity expired and deemed that my account is a ""security concern"". Therefore I will need KYC myself again. They cannot provide any terms of service where an already KYC account need to reverify due to an expired proof of identity.** 

Finally, here is their ""User Agreement"" regarding verification.

Finally it becomes the new ""bitcoin"" and takes it's proper place in the #1 slot.

Well you can bet your ass, that the glow boys will be back. If the conspiracies can be believed, then someone had a very successful psy-op against bitcon which resulted in the split. Which set the real bitcoin (BCH) back by at least 5 years. Maybe more. Obviously we can't have that happen again. If we do, when does it end? If you keep allowing it, they'll just keep swatting it back down and setting it back 5 years every time it threatens them.

But a lot can be learned from the first time. We don't have to repeat the mistakes of the past. So have steps been taken to prevent/preempt another banker or glowboy invasion?

Do you agree with him?,"Anatoly Yakovenko, one of the co-founders of Solana, a consensus-based PoS blockchain, shared his thoughts on bitcoin's proof-of-work (PoW) and how it may effect the leading cryptocurrency in the future. In an interview with CNBC, Yakovenko noted that one of the major distinctions between Solana and Bitcoin is the former's energy efficiency.

Yakovenko elaborated on this:
According to Solana's energy report, a single Solana transaction consumes around the same amount of energy as two Google searches. Even among proof-of-stake networks, I believe it is one of the most efficient. 
Yakovenko went on to say that most of the networks people would use in the future will be built on PoS consensus, in his opinion. In response to a question about Bitcoin's future in this setting, Yakovenko stated:

Nobody will utilize [Bitcoin] if it does not move to proof-of-stake at some point.

I don't agree with him. I think Bitcoin would survive even without switching to a proof of stake system of operation. Bitcoin has in recent years come under heavy fire for it's environmental impact but that hasn't changed how much value is placed in the network. The proof-of-stake consensus has been shown be require way more energy consumption that the Proof-of- Work system Bitcoin currently operates.   

Other major players in the crypto community seem to be adopting Proof-of-stake system as Ethereum  platform is set to change it's network operation to proof of stake.

ugyqnu,Allyson765,2,https://redd.it/ugyqnu,None,Mexico City‚Äôs Senate Building Now Has a Bitcoin ATM (Report),"Another Bitcoin Automated Teller Machine (ATM) has apparently been installed in Mexico City, this time in the Senate building. Some local leaders, like Miguel ngel Mancera, were reportedly behind the action.

According to local reports, the Mexican government built the 14th Bitcoin ATM in the Senate building in Mexico City, indicating that the digital asset will be used again in the future. Cancn, Tijuana, Guadalajara, and Culiac√°n are among the cities with the remaining 13 such devices. 

It's worth mentioning that the move was pushed through by certain well-known Mexican leaders. Miguel Angel Mancera, the past mayor of Mexico City, is one of them. He believes bitcoin has established itself as a viable competitor to major payment networks like PayPal and Visa, and that it is on its way to becoming mainstream:

""I believe it has already reached a boiling point, as we would call it in evolution,"" says the author.

Indira Kempis, a Mexican senator and a proponent of the bitcoin industry, promoted the idea on Twitter. She proclaimed the well-known phrase ""to the moon"" as she stood close to the ATM. 

Following that, Ricardo Monreal, President of the Senate's Political Coordination Board, suggested that Mexico's government should embrace the crypto industry and create a regulatory framework. Other Central and South American countries, such as Panama, Argentina, Brazil, and Peru, have already joined the bandwagon, he noted. As a result, Mexico should follow suit in order to avoid falling behind in this area. Bitcoin by all means is the flagship of the crypto world being the most traded and valuable crypto over the likes of ETH and XRP, Memecoins like Doge and Ripple and NFT utility tokens like Sandbox and $Cray of the Crayon Dao. Such win by BTC represents a win to the crypto society at large.

Senator Kempis announced in February that he will fight for legislation to make Mexico the second country, after El Salvador, to recognize bitcoin as a legal tender. 

""We need bitcoin to be legal tender in Mexico because if it isn't, it will be very difficult to take action,"" she stated at the time.

She also stressed the importance of such legislation, citing the fact that millions of Mexicans lack access to fundamental financial services, and that cryptocurrency may be a viable alternative. 

Kempis submitted a measure centered on digital assets over two weeks ago. It was not, however, intended to make BTC legal tender. Instead, she went against CBDCs, claiming that ""only the central bank"" in Mexico could issue a digital currency.",20,btc,2022-05-02 20:22:16

I thought it could make for an interesting discussion for how this relates to Bitcoin Cash and the experience people have had in building voluntary adoption in other places in the world.

> The differences between the various proposed technical changes to the block chain, are far less important to the futures of those forks, than the integrity of the people who support and do business using them.

This is why we in Bitcoin Cash should take care not to associate ourselves knowingly with those whose business is built in known ways on fraud. Because that taints the reputation of our endeavour and can destroy the efforts put in by those working on adoption.

> If someone hires a troll army to attack a community by astroturfing fake support for something, can you respect that person? If someone drives people who disagree away with personal abuse, is that a reasonable method for coming to an agreement about a protocol? Is it a valid form of technical reasoning to launch a sabotage against a block chain based consensus mechanism? What can you say about someone who buys existing accounts of users whom others trust in order to fake trusted support for their agenda? How about when it happens after those users whom others trust have been driven away or left in disgust? Is it a respectful negotiator interested in the insights of others in solving a problem, whose negotiating skills include locking the damn doors and refusing to let someone leave the room until they get his signature on an ‚Äúagreement‚Äù that they wrote without his knowledge before he even got there?

> Is someone who would participate in a fight, on those terms, someone whose agenda or business interests you really want to support? Hint: You already know that people who fake support for their agenda, or tell lies about other in order to discredit them, or who deliberately deceive others about the merits of their own proposal or others‚Äô proposals, are doing business by means of fraud. Do you want to carry on until the fraud is financial and the victim is you?

Take these wise words from one of the first Bitcoiners and a real cypherpunk to heart. He literally helped Satoshi by reviewing the code of Bitcoin before it was ever released. He accompanied Bitcoin at the very least from inception through the block size wars and the creation of Bitcoin Cash. While he was skeptical about the success of forks based on the above considerations, he was not opposed to them on a technical level. I encourage you to read the whole interview.

I think big merchants face the chicken-egg problem of their customers not having crypto to spend at their shop, which makes them hesitate to accept crypto in the first place.

What if they could offer, on their payment checkout path, some way for their normie customers to get a sizeable crypto reward on top of their purchase?

Not talking the few sats that BTC sites sometimes dispense, but something in the tens of dollars (which might obviously be sold together with the product in the form of some 'buy this and get a BCH top-up' bundle).

The ""reward"" would have to be enough for the customer to use later on to buy something real in the crypto world.

They would then incentivize the spending of crypto on their site again with discount, in order to stimulate crypto payments which ultimately save the merchant payment processor fees?

Maybe a collection of online businesses would even need to get together initially to make such a crypto rewards scheme work since the reward might be too small for a customer to spend directly at the merchant where he got it, but they might spend a smaller reward amount elsewhere... Anyway, that's probably where the incentives get muddled, and perhaps people use reward tokens already instead of directly handing out BCH (thinking of GoCrypto / GOC).

I still think that e-commerce is a key area where BCH can shine and needs to kickstart some payment cycles that evolve into real p2p electronic cash payments and not so much hassle-filled payment gateway experiences.

> In a 2020 Vanity Fair article Nick Bilton wrote that, according to investigators and attorneys involved in the case, Ulbricht had been offered a favorable plea deal which would have likely given him a decade-long sentence, but he turned it down. Bilton wrote, ""(Ulbricht) believed that he was smarter than everyone in the room, and that he could beat them all.""[53] Assistant US Attorney Timothy Howard, who was co-responsible for prosecuting the case, testified that the only plea offer was made before Ulbricht's indictment and carried a mandatory minimum of 10 years to a maximum of life imprisonment and that the United States sentencing guideline was life imprisonment.[54]

I don't understand the last quoted sentence as it's impossible to sentence someone to a ""range of two values"" (i.e. 10 years to life). The judge has to pick an exact number of years/months, correct?

https://old.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/uklsod/the_sec_is_preparing_for_an_increasingly_risky/i7qmv71/?context=3


then got this reply in personnel inbox not out in the open for everyone to see:

""Your comments aren't getting ""ghosted away."" In fact, we've tolerated you constantly spreading your conspiracies and misinformation on this sub. Even after we've educated you about forks and shitcoins, you still continue attempting to trick users by commenting that altcoins are different from shitcoins and that shitcoin that fork off from bitcoin are good. Perhaps we should start removing all of your garbage comments since you're already accusing us of it?""

so i made this reply to the unknown mod:

""ok i appreciate it if you guys dont ghost my comments away anymore

but you know if 2 things are different then they cannot have the same name so thats why altcoins are not shitcoins and as you can see from the cdc gov link crypto makes you go to the bathroom lots lol so thats why crypto means shitcoins..ok perfect but the difference between a shitcoin and a altcoin is that the shitcoin was premined and a altoin there is no premine because when you fork from bitcoin you take a copy from the ledger and then go from there so theres no premining of coins..but even if you did alter the ledger it would still be a altcoin because alt stands for alternative version of bitcoin the first ledger ever and the fairest start ever

true none of this stuff is written in stone yet so maybe you think this is a battle of opinions..but if you ghost away my comments about this then thats simply not cool

also i wouldnt care about this actually cept its important when u understand that forks from bitcoin are important for bitcoin to survive..cuz forks from bitcoin are like feelers for what bitcoin can do and like a true test in the real world

some here seem to want bitcoin to 'ossify' but i dont ..i think bitcoin can do everything and that why we need bitcoin to be able to use its forking abilities for many things that most here are not aware of yet it seems

yes its complicated..but so are many things in life..such as how can bitcoin escape the paper i.o.u's(back to trust) and bitcoin is meant to be trustless..so the 2 clash..and if trust wins then bitcoin loses..we dont want that right?

so if we encourage a bitcoin eco_system where people fork from bitcoin for the ideas rather than what they are doing now which is to premine for the ideas then that means bitcoin can escape the paper i.o.u's of trust because custodians will have to do proof of reserves and keep everyones bitcoin seperate in order to be able to hand out whatever fork that customer wants if say they want to trade it or spend it etc

so if we call forks from bitcoin shitcoins then it steers everyone actually towards the real shitcoins and not towards building a bitcoin eco-system that does the job of all of the shitcoins but better for everyone that holds real bitcoin(no premines remember)..and thats how bitcoin gets to a mil. and more is cuz then bitcoin does ""everything""

bcash for example was just an idea that turns out the people dont want..but bcash was trying to be a better bitcoin so thats a bold move but the people decided and the only ones that lost out were the ones that wantd the bcash idea and then put their money into that..but really average joe dont have to be concerned cuz they will have both..but bitcoin is so huge now that to try to be a better bitcoin is very small chance to do that so most forking will be just for ideas...and if any of those ideas becomes popular then bitcoin can consider to adopt it into itslef if it was wanted but that would be judging by how popular the fork was and if it was becoming a threat to the real bitcoin...thats true democracy by the masses

forking from bitcoin is an ability of bitcoin itself..a true way to upgrade chosen by the masses

hope this explains it more""

then got this reply:

""Nobody is ""ghosting"" your comments. There is no such thing as ghosting. We removed one single comment of yours because it was false.

Stop spreading misinformation and trying to confuse newbies.

    also i wouldnt care about this actually cept its important when u understand that forks from bitcoin are important for bitcoin to survive..cuz forks from bitcoin are like feelers for what bitcoin can do and like a true test in the real world

False. Utter bullshit.

Forks are not ""like Bitcoin's feelers""

Shitcoins that fork off from Bitcoin are not a good thing and we shouldn't encourage or support them.

You thing BCH, BSV, BTG, and BCD are a good thing?

    but bcash was trying to be a better bitcoin

False. They wanted to take over Bitcoin and it was an attack on Bitcoin. Bcash was created because a group of Bitcoin miners in China that controlled a large amount of Bitcoin's hashrate were using a secret mining enhancement called AsicBoost that gave them a 20% hashrate advantage. Bitcoin was going to implement SegWit and SegWit is not compatible with AsicBoost. The majority of miners did not support SegWit because they were using AsicBoost and they wanted to keep using AsicBoost.

Bitcoin Improvement Proposals are how Bitcoin is upgraded. If someone has an idea of how to improve Bitcoin, then they can submit a BIP. And there is already an altcoin that acts as Bitcoin's live in the field testnet. It's called Litecoin. New technology can be tried out on Litecoin before being considered for Bitcoin. That's what was done with the Lightning Network. And now Litecoin is going to integrate mimblewimble which could possibly be implemented on Bitcoin in the future.""

so i replyed back:

""so you just called litecoin an altcoin...so tell me why you didnt call it a shitcoin? after all it is a fork from bitcoin that made someone really rich and that now rich person used to work at coinbase hmmmm...

its called the blocksize war not the asic boost war..they even have a book about it

you say things like false and utter bullshit but really its just your opinion

if you think 'they' wanted to take over bitcoin do you now think the 'theys' are now gone forever and bitcoin is like forever safe or something?

if bitcoin stays on a singlular path and cant fork then it 'is' taken over because price discovery is in the den of the old fiat monsters and its done through i.o.u's same way all things on the markets are controlled so thats why people use real estate for saving..but real estate is taxed on the clock so ya its ok i guess lol...but can you tax gold or bitcoin on the clock?

im not sure who im talking to right now but it seems you havnt thought all of this out too well cuz your solution of bitcoin ossifying or staying on a singular path has lots of holes in it

cant you see i want us all to work together and all im really talking about here is that bitcoin can do much much more than it is right now and at the same time be even more stable and under less threats from 'all' angles

how else can we solve the paper bitcoin i.o.u's problem too? well this bitcoin 'eco-system' solves all of the problems and actually you havnt even mentioned one reason why this is 'bad' for bitcoin""

then got this reply back:



   "" so you just called litecoin an altcoin...so tell me why you didnt call it a shitcoin?

I don't call Litecoin a shitcoin because it's basically Bitcoin's live in the field test net. New tech can be tested on a real cryptocurrency before being considered for Bitcoin. Because if something happens critical to Litecoin, it's no big deal. But if something critical happened to Bitcoin, it would be a big deal. But I don't consider 100% of altcoins to be shitcoins. And being a shitcoin has nothing to do with if they forked off from Bitcoin or not. I can think of one particular altcoin that isn't a shitcoin and it didn't fork off from Bitcoin. But I do agree with you about premined coins. All premined coins are shitcoins. But well over 99% of all altcoins are shitcoins.

The only thing that I like about Litecoin is that new Bitcoin technology can get tested on it before being considered for Bitcoin. And the Litecoin developers have been supportive of this. But the fact is, Litecoin practically had a premine because the first 10,000 blocks were mined in a bit over 23 hours. Only 576 blocks should've been mined in the first day according to the officially communicated blocktime of 2.5 minutes. This emission is almost 18 times faster than scheduled and it didn't change despite 4 difficulty adjustments. That was basically a premine for Charlie Lee. Then Charlie Lee sold all of his LTC for over $200 each.

I didn't day that Bitcoin should ossify. Bitcoin is upgraded through BIPs. If someone has an idea to upgrade Bitcoin, then they can submit a BIP. Shitcoins forking off from Bitcoin is not a good thing. Shitcoin forks don't solve the paper bitcoin IOU problem. Don't buy paper bitcoin and you wont have a problem.

I'm finished having this conversation with you. You don't understand Bitcoin and forks as well as you think you do. Stop spreading misinformation or maybe we will start ""ghosting your misinformation comments"" AKA removing them. You already accused us of it.""

You have been temporarily muted from r/Bitcoin. You will not be able to message the moderators of r/Bitcoin for 7 days.

end of story: just thought id let you guys know cuz many of you probably already been through it too and idk where else can a person go for justice when the mods are being gatekeepers on bitcoin and preventing ideas also they deleted many more than just 1 of my comments its just its hard to dig them up

idk maybe some here can see the bigger picture of how to get everyone working together instead of against each other..but idk maybe bitcoin has already ossified and the only way now is for some smaller coin to do the bitcoin eco-system thing through the forking power and put the pressure onto the ossified bitcoin..thats sort of how it would work in the eco-system anyways",15,btc,2022-05-08 10:29:00
ul1eyx,Borracho_mejor,3,https://redd.it/ul1eyx,üõ†Ô∏è Services,Introducing Borracho.cash - a small smartBCH (future BCH) help/info site,"Hey guys, I wanted to share something I've been working on in my limited free time lately.

Today, I'm officially announcing the release of [https://borracho.cash](https://borracho.cash)  
You will probably be most interested in specifically [https://borracho.cash/smartBCH](https://borracho.cash/smartBCH)

This was designed to be a quick help/information site for smartBCH, with plans for much more. I'm an SE student, close to finishing my degree, and decided to build this from the ground up as a way to help the BCH and smartBCH community while serving as a learning experience.

This is my first 'real' project, so it probably has a few bugs, sorry mobile users üò¨. Please report anything you see wrong, any issues you see, any requests, or any projects you think should be added to the Support/Listing Telegram at [https://t.me/borrachocash](https://t.me/borrachocash).

You can also join the Announcements channel at [https://t.me/borrachocashannouncements](https://t.me/borrachocashannouncements), where I'll post any important updates.

Anyways, this is very much a work in progress and a 'roadmap' for the site and my future plans will be released soon...or at some point.

ul8mj6,E-renter,39,https://redd.it/ul8mj6,None,Some fresh thoughts on proof of stake for Bitcoin,"This post was censored at r/Bitcoin. I have heard r/btc is open to free speech/ideas. So please hear me out if you have 10 minutes to waste. 

Edit: Guys thank you for all the feedback. Most of it was constructive, and pretty much all of it was against proof of stake for various reasons. I wasn't trying to convince everybody, but I wanted to get everybody's thoughts. I think I have a pretty good sense of the community now. You couldn't have this over on r/Bitcoin which is probably why I didn't find any posts on it before I made this post. I just joined this sub today. In fact it has become apparent to me this is a bch sub but that being said the discussion is relevant and I appreciate the uncensored discussion. Thanks again.

I'm pretty near a Bitcoin maxi. About 88% of my crypto is in Bitcoin atm, 11% in a high cap alt I believe in long term (not ETH), and 1% in a low cap alt (lottery ticket/hobby). The alts are both proof of stake (POS), and I have those coins staked on their native onchain platforms for residual income. I own the private keys, and trust only the smart contracts, no person or country/province can KYC my ass and seize my coins. OTOH, my Bitcoin (vast majority of my crypto) sits in cold storage earning nothing because there is no decentralized staking option. Yes I could lend the Bitcoin via Celsius or crypto.com or Nexo etc. which I see many here are doing. However, that is antithetical to the main idea of Bitcoin (unseizable, uncensorable, unprintable). You know those guys are running fractional reserves, and it takes just one bad bear market for a Ponzi to implode. Ask Bernie Madoff investors in 2008, or QuadrigaCX in 2018, or Bitconnect, etc. I will not risk my precious Bitcoin in the hands of some reckless CEO lending it on to day traders and hoping withdrawals don't exceed deposits, while paying themselves and investors unsustainable paper returns. Play stupid games long enough and it becomes statistically more certain you will win stupid prizes.

What is the solution then to allow me to stake 88% of my crypto holdings (Bitcoin) for residual income while owning my private keys? Seems to me that POS is worth considering. For those about to say I am no Bitcoin maxi to even consider this, are you a Bitcoin maxi to lend your Bitcoin out to some Ponzi or CEX for a paper receipt? At least POS lets you own your private keys. Remember this line from Bitcoin rap battle in 2018: ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt need to trust the people you just need to trust the code.‚Äù Change can happen, and it is not always bad. Segwit was an improvement in block structure made in response to high fees / low throughput. It was great for Bitcoin. Today, plenty of Bitcoin ""hodlers"" are not actually hodling shit other than a Celsius network login/password. Not only does this risk their own Bitcoin, but it contributes to the devaluation of Bitcoin by helping create paper Bitcoin. POS can help solve both because your coins are locked in open source smart contracts, not in the SQL database of some CEX that might point to no real coins (ask QuadrigaCX bagholders), or be seized because KYC/AML or you might be a Russian (even if you live in Canada and do not support their war) or someone else the USA decides they dislike next week.

Can POS be done with a fixed supply? YES. Both my alts are fixed-supply coins (unlike ETH). You stake for fees + remaining block rewards, same as Bitcoin miners get right now. I would NEVER advocate changing the 21m supply cap and nor would that be necessary, it is a red herring to suggest otherwise.

Caveats? Sure. This is a huge programming task with the associated risks of bugs/exploits during the transition. Maybe even long term POS has some weakness that POW does not. Centralization might be one, though over time this would likely be less of an issue especially as people take their coins off exchanges to stake them onchain, and wider adoption continues.

Anyway, maybe a BIPxxx one day will be put forth. I‚Äôm an analyst and a coder of many years in myriad languages, but not a Bitcoin coder, so it would probably not be me, but just throwing this out there. I‚Äôm pretty sure it‚Äôs been discussed and shot down many times, but I haven‚Äôt seen any discussion of it lately other than how pissed people got when a speaker at the recent Bitcoin conference mentioned the idea. But with all the recent Bitcoin ‚Äúhodlers‚Äù here casually mentioning giving up their private keys for a little side income from Celsius or crypto.com, I thought this might be worth a fresh look.",9,btc,2022-05-08 19:01:40

um2zem,jjmhtp,1,https://redd.it/um2zem,None,"Flipstarter: Hercules A Multisignature Self Custody Wallet For IOS, Android","Hello to everybody on r/btc

My name is Jiajun Qian, I'm a developer currently building out an open source self custody mobile wallet for Bitcoin Cash.  The project aims to provide users with a self custody wallet that's accessible to anyone via IOS, and Android. The Hercules wallet features an optional Multisignature setup permitting multiple users, signers to join into the mobile setup configured by the user (2-of-3, 2-of-2, 1-of-4, etc).  Together each of the cosigners sign off on transaction proposals for the funds being held in custody through the mobile client.

I go into a bit more detail demonstrating the various types of different use cases, applications that the mobile wallet can serve in the Flipstarter campaign linked here: [http://flipstarter.bchhub.cash](http://flipstarter.bchhub.cash)

While I continue to build out the mobile wallet; I'm also working on making the latest consensus changes scheduled to activate next week on May 15th to the badger-cash node library [https://github.com/bitcoincashhub/bcash](https://github.com/bitcoincashhub/bcash) .  Since the Multisignature library that the mobile wallet utilizes, is built on the badger-cash node library I believe it's good practice to update the library. In the same regard I'd like to be able to provide as much infrastructure tools, and applications to developers as possible during the process of me working on the mobile wallet.  

All of these projects are and will be hosted here : [https://github.com/bitcoincashhub](https://github.com/bitcoincashhub) .

I'm dedicating as much time as possible into building out the mobile wallet. In search of achieving the milestones I've set for the projects beta release listed in the projects proposal section in the Flipstarter campaign. Please take a look at the campaign and support if the project, and  projects I'm working on seem valuable and worth supporting to you and the community.  My end goal is to improve the current Bitcoin Cash ecosystem and create great projects that can be used for to for everyday use .

I'm able to be reached at via email at: [jiajunwuqiong@gmail.com](mailto:jiajunwuqiong@gmail.com) / [jjqian@163.com](mailto:jjqian@163.com)

And on telegram, wechat:   jjqian01

I want to thank all of the Bitcoin Cash supporters, and developers who help make Bitcoin Cash the best form of digital currency available in the world. I'm looking to continue building out great projects and advance the current ecosystem this year with new applications, projects under the BitcoinCashHub organization.

I am also actively looking for new opportunities in the Bitcoin Cash development space as well. If there are any projects and teams looking for active contributors please reach out to me and let me know!",6,btc,2022-05-09 22:20:10

    First you lied about us ""ghosting your comments."" Now you're in the Bcash subreddit and lying about being banned. You were not banned. I'm going to go ahead and ban you because you're already telling everyone that we banned you.

Reminder from the Reddit staff: If you use another account to circumvent this subreddit ban, that will be considered a violation of the Content Policy and can result in your account being suspended from the site as a whole.

(edit: topped it up to 2.5 so it qualifies for posting on /r cc)

This is no ordinary address, this is a [P2SH address](https://btcinformation.org/en/developer-guide#pay-to-script-hash-p2sh),  which means that it is a ""smart contract"" address. Anyone who wants to  spend from it must satisfy the contract, and I designed it so that  ANYONE will be able to satisfy it. First come, first served! :)

There's a catch, though - the contract uses [Script](https://reference.cash/protocol/blockchain/script) features ([native introspection opcodes](https://gitlab.com/GeneralProtocols/research/chips/-/blob/master/CHIP-2021-02-Add-Native-Introspection-Opcodes.md#chip-2021-02-native-introspection-opcodes) and [OP\_MUL](https://gitlab.com/GeneralProtocols/research/chips/-/blob/master/CHIP-2021-02-Bigger-Script-Integers.md#technical-specification))  that will only become available when the May 2022 Bitcoin Cash upgrade  will be activated ([countdown](https://cash.coin.dance/)). Because of that, nobody can spend from the address  yet and that gives you a few days of time to figure out how to craft the  spending transaction in anticipation of the upgrade activation.

Anyone is able to do the same, so it will be a race - who will  broadcast the valid spending transaction first and at the right time to  claim the reward?

The contract redeem script is: `0xc3518876cd00c788cc00c65f956096a269cd3a6a38486170707920426974636f696e2043617368204d61792d32303232207570677261646521202d20626974636f696e6361736861757469737487`

and here's a link to a very useful tool for Script contracts (kudos to /u/bitjson): [https://ide.bitauth.com/](https://ide.bitauth.com/).

I suggest using [Electron Cash](https://electroncash.org/index.html)  to make a dummy TX that sends to your address, export the TX into a  file then edit it in your favorite text editor to replace the input with  the one spending the reward, load it back into Electron Cash and  broadcast!

The transaction format is documented here: [https://reference.cash/protocol/blockchain/transaction/](https://reference.cash/protocol/blockchain/transaction/)

I will not give any other help - you figure it out, good luck!",51,btc,2022-05-11 10:17:25

When the peg was over a dollar the address or miners or whatever would increase the issuance.

unfca9,lightswarm124,10,https://redd.it/unfca9,üî£ Misc,Temporary (alpha) fix for Badger Wallet being discontinued after the upcoming May upgrade,"Just saw that the Badger Wallet will no longer be supported (presumably due to the BCash client not keeping up with the upcoming network upgrade). We at Bitcoin Bay had developed a fork of the Badger Wallet, loosely named OPTN, replacing BitBox-SDK with Permissionless Software Foundation's BCH-JS library. BCH-JS defaults to connecting with a Fullstack.cash BCHN full node (I believe it should be compatible with the BU client as well). 

We have an early release of the CashScript integration we had been working prior to COVID which people can find and download from our GitHub page - https://github.com/BitcoinBay/OPTN-Wallet/releases

The CashScript integration is still just in demo phase, so it is not guaranteed to send properly. But regular features, like SLP tokens, should still function as expected. Indexing for the SLP tokens will take a bit of time as it is still using the legacy SLPDB indexer.

We at Bitcoin Bay had started with a rewrite of the Badger wallet due to a lot of outdated infrastructure popping up during development. Some may recall we tried doing a Flipstarter campaign a few months back on OPTN, which unfortunately didn't get much traction, and thus we decided to put the rewrite effort on the back burner for the time being. For reference, here's the repo for our rewrite efforts https://github.com/BitcoinBay/rewriteOptn

We still have plans to support the wallet moving forward, the main challenge is securing enough funding to hire a small dedicated team of developers (2~4 people) for the wallet. We're also exploring a seed-round investment to jumpstart the development, so if enough people are interested in seeing the Badger Wallet be maintained moving forward, it would help with the pitch to potential investors.",16,btc,2022-05-11 17:36:03

Obviously we can have like a warning/educational period like we do for forks, that the denomination is changing for wallets/exchanges etc.

Stocks do this all the time to make it easier for people to purchase, and this causes people to feel better since they own many entire shares.

unyb3n,undadatunda,7,https://redd.it/unyb3n,‚å® Discussion,whats the point of trustless systems when they just turn back into trusted (i.o.u's)?,"the laws of supply and demand cannot be verified  in the trusted world of i.o.u's

basically none of the custodians are doing proof of reserves

so basically the big dogs have come to eat everyones lunch cuz the whole systems all of them basically have failed satoshi laws  so that makes the entire system easy prey

so basically the whole eco-systems can only blame themselves for going back into the trusted world and away from satoshi's trustless world

so if we cant change the old system that is right now raping the world of cryptocurrencies,then we have to change the incentive structures to make it so the players dont want to use the trusted system anymore(i.o.u's)

this is where forks come into play i think..thats the cure all because i.o.u's cant follow along when a coin is forking or dropping forks into the hodlers hands

so this coin if it wants to escape needs to encourage a eco-system of forking

forking is as natural born ability of bitcoin..but yet the current bitcoin is afraid of forks..so afraid in fact that the community has been coerced into cencoring all talk of bitcoins forking abilities

step 1.  is you need an exchange that will accept all forks from bitcoin to be listed..and this is basically the opposite of the current exchanges that are demanding money to list coins so that just excludes forks from bitcoin because when forking from bitcoin you dont get any free coins(premined coins) to bribe the exchanges with to list the fork

step 2. some program to make forking easy for any average joe to do,including choose your proof
 (this was done in the past but then according to rumor a premining shitcoin bought it to stop the forking from bitcoin) 

step 3. again it has to be easy to get the forks listed this is critical and the goal should be 50+ forks a day being dropped into the hodlers hands(the world will never be short of ideas just look at the premined coins and all of their ideas well that can be done too but from forking for ideas instead of premining for ideas)

step 4.give fair notice before listing a forked coin...satoshi gave fair notice before bitcoin was launched

i think trustless is one of satoshi's laws so if something breaks that law then its basically pointless and garbage..but look where price discovery is right now..its in the land of trust,a broken land",1,btc,2022-05-12 10:51:05

Maybe it was, maybe it wasn‚Äôt, but now whatever potential there was happening, now is gone. 
Looking at the Brightside, Bitcoin liquidations were low this time. People were cautious and avoiding going long, just in case something happened, and something did. Caution pays off.  On weekly timeframes, BTC/USD was near to completing its sixth consecutive red weekly candle ‚Äî something which had only occurred once before in its history back in 2014.

Just goes to show, that we must not be too hopeful. Of course, on the long-term, one should not be worried, but on the short-term, yeah, you should. The Luna catastrophe is going to make a lot of people question every currency out there, and Bitcoin will be one to go one the stand as well, you better be ready to hold. 
In the meantime, all you have to do, is hold. Avoid the doom posts of social media, they just want you to sell early, and manage your own risk accordingly. Avoid cashing out, and stick to using cryptocurrency for pretty much everything, even regular things. There are now platforms like Binance pay that allow you to pay (without fees) with crypto or even places like exeno that allow you to buy and sell things with cryptocurrency at any time you choose. Try to avoid cash and use those places instead.

However nobody really knows how many reserves they have, if those are in crypto or in cash or in whatever.

They are a black box. 

This 5 billion, is it them pretending to cashing out a whale?

Are THEY cashing out themselves?

Did they really just redeem 5 billion Tether for 5 billion dollars?

Nobody knows ... well somebody does ... but it's not me or you. 

We all know that one day Tether will die.

It's very possible that it will happen now.

Right now after these massive crashes, everybody is expecting a recovery.

But if the fed announces they are touching interest rates again or if Europe and the USA come out with strict regulation on stablecoins.

This might spook the stablecoin system. When there is panic amongst the whales, the entire cryptocurrency system will follow luna in absolutely no time.

It will be unlike anything the world has ever seen. 

This is the best thing ever for P2P cash cause it will be the great reset after which everybody loses almost everything.

And BCH can start over from basically zero, trying to find adoption. 

But in the process the price of BCH will dip and dip and dip and dip and dip.

If there are cryptocurrencies that survives such a reset it will be only three. Ethereum, monero and Bitcoin Cash.

Sure, Bitcoin will look to the be the first recovering. But then people will be like: wait a minute, this stuff has no utility why does it have value?

The world post Tether will be radically different.

One way of looking at the insane increase of stablecoins the last 2 years is the following.

If you believe the prices of cryptocurrencies will go up, you don't put your money in stablecoins.

So that means the more stable coins there are and the more money in those stablecoins the more people bet on the prices of crypto going down, not up. 

BUSD, USDC, DAI .... they should survive.

And once Tether is gone, the system will be much fairer for Ethereum, monero and Bitcoin Cash.

If this reset happens it's pretty much a given that Ethereum will overtake Bitcoin in marketcap, because of it's utility. 

Because of all the stablecoins and tokens on Ethereum it's more economic resilient then Bitcoin.

Bitcoin only has one thing going for it. The high price and the believe that the price will go even higher.

Something happens to Tether that causes the right amount of panic and that Bitcoin believe melts like snow when the sun comes up.

And then Bitcoin has nothing left. 

I could see all of this play out in just 3 weeks. 

Luna went to zero in 3 days. 99,9% of crypto could go to zero in just 3 weeks. 

And even if you would short, you would most likely still lose because of how Tether has infected every single part of the ecosystem.

Luna went down in just 3 days. The moon went blood red. Maybe it's a sign. And everybody is incredibly nervous right now, and this makes for the perfect possible panic.",21,btc,2022-05-14 05:40:55

For or Against: Bitcoin Cash has a better scaling strategy by gradually increasing the L1 (layer 1) block size as demand increases. When each block is produced, a limited number of transactions will be allowed by the network. By increasing the block size along with demand, the network can guarantee that its users will have low fees, high confidence of their transaction being accepted without waiting for a block to include it, and a strong foundation to build the infrastructure of programmable money.

If you're not into riddles, and making history is a reward in itself, you can just propagate your own forking transaction, you can do so with this [script by Mr Culianu](https://gitlab.com/bitcoin-cash-node/bitcoin-cash-node/-/merge_requests/1537/diffs). Don't be intimidated, most of it is just boilerplate to avoid dependecies. This lets you wait for the right time to propagate a transaction, so that you don't need to do it manually. As written in the documentation, the usage is `poll_broadcast_txn.py <host> <port> <rpcuser> <rpcpass> <mtptarget> <txnhex> [sleeptime]`. Very conveniently, Mr Culianu has already set up a P2SH UTXO for this, and you can actually use the following to fork: 

`./poll_broadcast_txn.py localhost 8332 MyRPCUserName MyRPCPassword 1652616000 0200000001f3aaf89275c451ba0668a34dcbdb759a657ad2a2eee35fbee41d9fd825ebaf16000000007a10476f20424348212059617921010203044c677400a06375687400a06375687400a06375687400a06375687400a06375687400a06375687400a06375687400a06375680400000001040000000295070000000000000288c35188c4518800cd1976a9147ee7b62fa98a985c5553ff66120a91b8189f658188ac87ffffffff0119030000000000001976a9147ee7b62fa98a985c5553ff66120a91b8189f658188ac00000000`

USDT is redeeming a lot of tethers recently. They are definitely not fully backed as historically they never were fully backed by dollars, so if large holders try cash out and dont get their cash , the peg between USDT and USD may break as people run for the exits. 

If they did the same scam as the recent failed algorithmic stablecoin and backed their token with Bitcoin they may be forced to sell off their holdings and crash BTC.

Historical, along with current data can be found here: https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/tether/historical-data/

As we know, Tether is supposed to be backed by 1:1 to the USD by Tether‚Äôs reserves. Tether allegedly has fiat, bonds, and other assets to do this (will address this a bit more below). Even though Tether is near its‚Äô peg, the change in market cap shows an overwhelming amount of redemption.

This is concerning for a few reasons, for one because the overall market is down. Meaning, the assets in Tether‚Äôs reserve also most likely are down as well. I‚Äôm not just talking about the crypto market, either. Since we do not have full transparency in Tether‚Äôs backing, many have speculated it‚Äôs tied to assets like BTC, which is also way down as well. Meaning, their backing ‚Äúpower‚Äù may be lower than it was previously and not exactly at 1:1.

As an example, for arguments sake, let‚Äôs say that BTC was bought and fully backed the USDT. Their average price for backing was when Bitcoin was at 30k. Now let‚Äôs say the market dips, and bitcoin goes to 27k. At the same time, many start redeeming Tether to cash out to fiat out of fear of the market conditions. This means that the backing of Tether is no longer 1:1 and since people are redeeming, Tether would have to sell off its bitcoin reserves for a loss of 10% to cover the redemption.

For doubters asking for factual evidence:**

https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8450-21

US government: 

>In fact Tether reserves were not ‚Äúfully-backed‚Äù the majority of the time.

>The order further finds that Tether failed to disclose that it included unsecured receivables and non-fiat assets in its reserves, and that Tether falsely represented that it would undergo routine, professional audits to demonstrate that it maintained ‚Äú100% reserves at all times‚Äù even though Tether reserves were not audited.

>As found in the order, Tether held sufficient fiat reserves in its accounts to back USDT tether tokens in circulation for only 27.6%

>held reserves in non-fiat financial products

Edit: **Tether and Bitfinex have gotten beyond desperate, they are offering 30-50% interest rates for USD loans on Bitfinex, thats higher than ponzi schemes, these guys have lost the plot.**",15,btc,2022-05-15 15:28:05

If you're not running a node: This is nothing to worry about, it is expected behavior. When a node is not upgraded on time, it usually will not be able to follow the Bitcoin Cash blockchain that the upgraded network considers valid.
It will simply hang around, while receiving blocks it considers invalid unless someone extends the old rules chain (which is normally not the case unless the upgrade is contentious).",61,btc,2022-05-15 17:07:52

Follow up on the 2.5 BCH giveaway (or how I outsourced making history),"First, congratulations to everyone on a smooth and successful Bitcoin Cash upgrade, and I'd dare say biggest upgrade Bitcoin has had since genesis!

I wanted to be part of history so I made sure of it by making a [competition](https://old.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/un6l6b/celebrating_bitcoin_cash_may2022_upgrade_2_bch/) and had so much fun observing how it went! Vanity can be fun! :D

1st block using new Bitcoin Cash features has been successfully mined and is full of transactions with the OP_RETURN message:

> Happy Bitcoin Cash May-2022 upgrade! - bitcoincashautist

and not one of those TXes was created by me! All of them were made by someone else, taking Bitcoin Cash out of my reward pool! :)

The reward pool has been almost entirely depleted in the first block, so congratulations to the winner or winners! There's now 205 transactions with the competition contract: https://bch.loping.net/address/bitcoincash:pzq2vg8ppftlnk7raj452eae33upjgedj5dnc5efg5 and each transaction that spends from that address has my message, because the contract requires it in order to be spent from :D

It's not the 1st TX in the block, however one of the reward spends made 2nd place, and congrats to whomever sent [this one](https://bch.loping.net/tx/00b73cd14c113a3b1d6ab88dfd61560c98d78d503e924d98bf6f7a11f63a567d) and made the first place. Still, the competition TX is the 1st one that uses and demonstrates features from both CHIPs so mission accomplished!

Also, congrats to ViaBTC and Mr. aziz2025 for mining the first [upgraded block](https://bch.loping.net/block/000000000000000002afc6fbd302f01f8cf4533f4b45207abc61d9f4297bf969)!

How does my contract work? It simply requires that:

- 15/16 of the amount being spent goes back to the same contract address
- an OP_RETURN output with my message is part of the transaction

The 1/16 is there for the taking and fee payment - winner(s) simply had to fill in their address and repeat the process until they depleted the contract address.

Congrats to all, and I hope to make something more cool for May 2023 upgrade!

US gets nothing.

Look at what Tom Duffy and the CME are doing to our industry, this decrepit guy is admitting to the US ag hearing what he & his crony did the last 4 year to us. If they try to give licenses to DeFi w/ gate keeping, Dedollarize everything, let them know.

You know how easy it is to just write a front end that shows the usd dollar amount of a completely different stable coin pegged to god knows what. Dedollarization.

Just build collateralized stable coins tied to a basket of 50 different currencies and 20 or 30 treasuries, plus 20 or 30 commodities, if these nation state want to do reflexivity attacks on the collateral, they'll have to short every major currency in every major country in the world. Invent our own peg. Over collateralize it to peg it to a past snap shot of itself at a given index of valued assets. It can be done.

&#x200B;

Unfortunately I believe normalizing stablecoin pegs to the US dollar was just a mistake and a giant lever of power for the gov to enforce kyc & gatekeeping for banking cartels on everything & one, to utterly destroy censorship resistance in the crypto ecosystem.  
This means a stateless currency pegged to ""things"" (in small .0001 decimal place value) is going to have to be anonymously made, collateralized, run by anonymous devs, or built in a failsafe way. The US gov only understands fraud, force, & violence & coercion.

&#x200B;

""Why flee the collapsing USD for a digital version pegged to it? Gtfo stables in general, stick to future proof currency that deflates over time. Screw stables full stop.""

&#x200B;

No one who has money on the line, or most advanced finance and fund management is going to just expose themselves to bitcoin and it's serious lack of stability, or any other deflationary asset. The concept of not having credit expansion or inflation in some degree, and some stability in asset price, is complete btc maxi peter pan stuff. I'm literally not talking about pegging it to the US dollar either, I'm talking about pegging it to the aggregate value of about 500 assets in decimal form, specially picked to reduce volatility, and to make impossible for the US gov to engage in reflexivity attacks without crashing the rest of the global economy.

&#x200B;

For now you cannot put this stablecoin which we will call a ""Defitii"" on Bitcoin Cash's blockchain, and btc cash cannot scale it's nodes well enough because of various engineering challenges (perhaps a lack of sharding for BCH just as with Eth, lack of ubiquitous cheap harddrives, lack of distributed storage doing what is tantamount to sharding to increase total # of nodes)

And for me it's simple: 

Bitcoin l1 is limited by 867 000 transcations a day. If billions of people would want to use it a single transcation per person would take decades. Even with l2 handling all transcations back and forth people have to interact with the base layer at some point, right? If not they never own any bitcoins and it would be so centralized there's no point at all. Not to speak of the security risks since lightning is not secured by the base layer.

I don‚Äôt value heroin any more than I value gold. I am not a jeweler or addict, but I know someone always values these things and will trade money for them, and if someone can use bitcoin to buy them, then via the transitive property, bitcoin is worth money. As long as it can be used to obtain something of value, and especially if it is the only or best way to obtain that thing, then it has value.

We say we want to build parallel economies, but those economies tend to be outlawed. So something that can continue to exist and be used in the face of being outlawed is truly resilient. We focus on means of exchange over store of value, but people need to value your thing in order to trade with you.

urnz6v,VevayBice52,8,https://redd.it/urnz6v,‚å® Discussion,"After the Terra/Luna crash the market needs more crypto utility, less speculation"," May 2022 will go down in the history books as a turning point in the roll-out of blockchain technology. It began with the dramatic implosion of TerraUSD, a leading ‚Äústablecoin‚Äù, whose value has depreciated from near $100 to practically zero in a matter of days. Holders of one of the market‚Äôs most popular cryptocurrencies are now, to borrow a term from traditional finance, left holding worthless paper. The volatility in the stablecoin landscape even unpegged Tether, the flagship stablecoin pegged to the USD, as it temporarily sank to $0.96 on May 12th before correcting. All the while, BTC itself has dropped to lows not seen since 2020, bringing into serious question the trajectory of the broader crypto/blockchain space moving forward.

Experts are now scratching their heads to answer this very question: what next? Despite the beating crypto markets have taken in recent days, a consensus is emerging that despite the volatility, crypto is simply too big to fail or just ‚Äúgo away‚Äù at this point in the game. According to Morningstar‚Äôs ‚Äú2022 Crypto Landscape‚Äù report, market capitalization for the top 100 coins topped $1.7 trillion in January 2022 as both casual awareness in the public and capital inflows have steadily increased in-step. Rather than relegating crypto to the dustbin of history, the current instability in the market is likely to spur a shift in the types of goods and services blockchain/web3 companies provide.

More specifically, I believe that the current burst of bearish volatility in crypto markets will make investors and wallet holders begin valuing more functional uses for crypto and blockchain tech, as opposed to the recent fixation on highly-speculative forex-style trading. Though the potential for massive upside remains, the stablecoins‚Äô dramatic crash has severely undermined public confidence in crypto‚Äôs function as a secure way to store wealth. Moving forward, I think that financial service providers for crypto holders will come out on top. Companies with tangible products and services, blockchain fintech if you will, stand to gain from the implosion of the overheated crypto trading space we‚Äôve seen in recent weeks. 

One particular niche in which I identify massive growth potential is in the area of crypto payment services. I remember the days when social payment apps like Venmo hit the market--it revolutionized how people spend money on the go. I imagine we will observe a similar trend take place over coming years, yet for seamless, fast, and cost-effective social payment services for crypto. Another area of anticipated change is the debate of centralized vs. decentralized exchanges. As the unpegging of Terra shows, fully decentralized algo-driven liquidity mechanisms can and do fail. We need a more stable, less risky alternative to prevent an entire generation‚Äôs accrued wealth from being wiped out in a matter of hours.

In an article that was actually published before the Terra/Luna crash, an opinion piece authored by Tyler Spalding agrees with this assertion and argues that the future of crypto payments will be both more tangible and more centralized; in his own words, ‚ÄúBeyond the idealism and technology, people inevitably use products that make their lives easier. People are predominantly going to use custodial wallets for retail payments. These products are safer, cheaper and more straightforward for an average person. People don‚Äôt care how payments work; they just want them to work.‚Äù 

Relatedly, Spalding also makes an argument for centralized network mechanisms to counterbalance some of the shortcomings of full decentralization that, practically speaking, negatively impact overall consumer welfare with little upside beyond the theoretical embrace of decentralization as a value in and of itself. According to him, ‚ÄúThe hard reality is that we‚Äôve never had truly full-stack decentralized payments in the first place. In the future, the significant majority of crypto payments will involve custodial products and multiple centralized components.‚Äù

The bottom line is that the future of crypto will likely see an emphasis placed on greater day-to-day utility as blockchain merges with or adopts goods and services provided by traditional financial institutions. Emerging regulatory frameworks for cryptocurrencies and digital assets are expected to streamline this process and accelerate the traditional FSIB industry‚Äôs embrace of blockchain financial technology. We are already beginning to see major financial institutions in the US like Fidelity‚Äôs idea of a BTC 401k plan, and this is just the beginning. The crypto winners of the future will not be sketchy exchanges with no accountability, identifiable team, or actual product, but credible providers of blockchain fintech that work to bridge the gap between crypto and traditional finance.",40,btc,2022-05-17 14:41:44

But Monero already solved this problem with the automatic blocksize limit. And this is a particularly novel solution, because it solves both sides of the equation: It prevents spam by keeping the ceiling close to usage, and it prevents consensus failure of increasing the limit in the future, since its automatic.

Now I could just stop here, because the blocksize limit seems to be the main point of contention in BCH. If so, how did Monero not fix it? Why was BCH needed?

(And its not like Monero is some random coin, its been *the* privacy coin, *the* darknet coin, and *the* cryptoanarchist coin for years. Fair distribution, adoption, and strong track record.)

I dont want to go on a long spiel detailing every reason why i think Monero solves every importantly solvable blockchain problem ever, because im sure i will have plenty of time engage with such ideas in the comments. But I would like to generally know why 1) You did not want to join Monero instead of create BCH and 2) Why your preference still lies with BCH?

Heres some examples of responses:

A) Didnt know Monero existed (and still doesnt? idk)

B) Ideologically opposed to privacy by default?

C) It *has* to be Bitcoin? (Leftover maximalism type of feelings? Or emotional attachment?)


Idk this really all that comes to me at the top of my head. Im having a hard time imagining what the reasons could be.

Feel free to list 1 to 3 solid reasons. Nonnegotiables. Please no ""I like Monero too i just like BCH more"" responses with no substantiation, i would like cold hard data. If you have a criticism of Monero, give it to me hot. 

Also please avoid long lists of negotiables, with no single strong reason (nonnegotiable) tying it all together. Creating a long list of loosely cohesive reasons for something is usually argument with poor structural integrity, aka coming up with reasons to meet parity with ones feelings.

Anyways, interested to hear the responses.",0,btc,2022-05-17 19:20:15

We have our ""bubble"" on Reddit where we can express our love about it, but we forget that many people don't have any interest or knowledge in it, and I don't just mean older people, people of all ages use the internet, and many of them aren't interested in it because they think it's rubbish.  


I figured it out because when I hear any amazing crypto news, like this week's gas fees being cheap, or about Unicoins and Unicorn companies, or about Moonbirds, or whatever, I don't have many people around me who I could tell about it.

This was my main doubt after a while.

I just checked the chart of bch. I had never properly seen it before. Its below the price it was in July 2017. 

- What should be my incentive to hold it?
- If there is no incentive, isnt it just better that I convert my dollars or bitcoin to BCH when I want to take advantage of this high tps or low fees. 

I get that this can change in the future. Like fees in bitcoin can become too high, etc. But right now, why should a person put the dollars that he earns at work to BCH, just to hold it. If he wants to buy something worth 20 dollars at a BCH accepting store due to some advantage, then he should just convert 20 dollars into BCH and use them. Why convert the rest of your dollars?

This happens in countries. People keep dollars in a safe at home, and only convert to their country's fiat if the want to pay for something in it.

Whats the incentive to hold bitcoin cash? Usually any persons incentive to hold something is for price appreciation or some emotional attachment.

utzuu6,Rucknium,22,https://redd.it/utzuu6,üß™ Research,[Original Research] 65 Percent of Pre-Fork BCH Has Been Spent,"On August 1, 2017, the Bitcoin Cash (BCH) hard fork occurred, raising the permitted bitcoin block size above 1MB and creating a separate history of transactions from that point forward. At the moment of the hard fork, all self-custody owners of BTC were endowed with an equal amount of BCH that they could spend with their private cryptographic keys. Owners of BTC on exchanges were at the mercy of the exchanges' decisions to allow trading or withdraw of BCH.

Owners of pre-fork BTC could choose to spend only their pre-fork BTC, only their pre-fork BCH, spend both, or do nothing at all. When I use ""spend"" in this post I mean transact with the coins on the blockchain. Coin owners could be sending to themselves, spending it on a good or service, sending it to an exchange to withdraw, or performing ""wallet maintenance"" if the owner is an exchange. Therefore, the blockchain data cannot tell us definitively whether certain pre-fork coins have changed ownership due to possible self-spending behavior. However, we can conclude that any self-custody coins that have not been spent on the blockchain have not been sold. Of course, it is widely believed that a large share of early bitcoins are now unspendable due to their corresponding private keys being lost.

With those caveats out of the way, let's go to the analysis, which was [generously funded](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/tt2giy/comment/i2wza86/) by u/moleccc.

# Analysis

The research process was fairly simple. From BTC and BCH full nodes I extracted data on all transaction outputs, their corresponding bitcoin value, and the time (block height) they were created.

I checked all pre-fork outputs for whether they had been spent prior to the fork. The outputs that remained unspent at the time of the fork constituted all BTC and BCH in existence at that point in time. Then I simply checked if and when each of these pre-fork outputs had been spent in a transaction on the post-fork BTC and BCH blockchains.

Here are the main results for the spent status of pre-fork bitcoin by bitcoin value (i.e. what appears on the blockchain rather than its fiat valuation) as of March 31, 2022:

|BTC|BCH|Bitcoin Value|Percent|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Unspent|Unspent|4,356,697|26.4%|
|Spent|Unspent|1,342,945|8.1%|
|Unspent|Spent|264,379|1.6%|
|Spent|Spent|10,515,129|63.8%|

Almost two-thirds of the value of pre-fork bitcoin has been spent on both the BTC and BCH blockchains. About one-quarter has not been spent on either blockchain; the private keys to many of those coins are probably lost forever, rendering the coins unspendable. By a 5-to-1 ratio more pre-fork bitcoin by value has been spent on the BTC blockchain but remained unspent on the BCH blockchain than bitcoin spent on BCH but unspent on BTC.

A stacked area chart of the trend over time with some key events is below:

&#x200B;

[Spent Status of Pre-fork BTC and BCH by Bitcoin Value](https://preview.redd.it/lwxbr5xvgn091.png?width=800&format=png&auto=webp&s=dbebebbc6e7368d7611c2a9c7f650638dd1ee4c8)

A large share of pre-fork bitcoin was rapidly spent in the first few months after the fork. After that, the rate of spending flattens out. In the early months there is almost an equal share of coins that are orange (BTC spent & BCH unspent) and green (BTC unspent & BCH spent), but over time the green share shrinks. There is a sudden jump in spending a few weeks after the BSV/BCH hard fork.

Instead of by value, we can also analyze spending behavior by number of outputs. This gives each output equal weight regardless of how large or small the bitcoin value of those outputs are, possibly giving better insight into the behavior of typical users rather than the few users and institutions that owned a large amount of bitcoin. On the other hand, very small amounts that are not worth transacting -- dust -- are also given equal weight in such an analysis.

The main results for the spent status of pre-fork bitcoin by number of outputs as of March 31, 2022:

|BTC|BCH|Number of outputs|Percent|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Unspent|Unspent|24,296,821|45.3%|
|Spent|Unspent|7,934,988|14.8%|
|Unspent|Spent|808,870|1.5%|
|Spent|Spent|20,617,669|38.4%|

Compared to the results by bitcoin value, a much greater proportion of outputs have been left unspent. In particular, the percentage of outputs that have remained ""orange"" (BTC spent & BCH unspent) rather than ""green"" (BTC unspent & BCH spent) is much larger. This may be a consequence of the lower fiat-denominated value of BCH compared to BTC. It may be worth it to move a small quantity of BTC, but not an equivalent quantity of BCH.

A stacked area chart of the trend over time is below:

&#x200B;

[Spent Status of Pre-fork BTC and BCH by Number of Outputs](https://preview.redd.it/2baytc9zgn091.png?width=800&format=png&auto=webp&s=5dc4535bec7fbdefab718f79e176992c78f063c1)

In this chart we can more clearly see the phenomenon of the green area (BTC unspent & BCH spent) rising substantially near the point of maximum USD/BCH exchange rate in December 2017. This may indicate that owners of pre-fork bitcoin may have been moving their BCH -- but not their BTC -- to take advantage of the high exchange rate and sell BCH for fiat currency. Over the following 12 months, the green area shrinks, indicating that those users who moved their BCH eventually also moved their BTC as well. Another notable feature of the chart is the depletion of the orange area (BTC spent & BCH unspent) over the second half of 2020, indicating that those users who had previously spent their BTC eventually spent their BCH as the cryptocurrency exchange rate was recovering after the early-COVID crash.

# Conclusion

As expected, the highest volume of spending of pre-fork BTC and BCH occurred in the first few days after the fork. There was also a spike in spending of low-value outputs on the BCH chain around the time of maximum USD/BCH exchange rate. The great majority of pre-fork BCH has already been spent (along with BTC), so it is unlikely that a large amount of BCH is waiting to be put back into circulation.

I think a debate platform might help with rigorous discussions between BCH and BTC so that claims can be shared as links without being reiterated over and over. Good idea or not?,"Hi. I took some time this week playing around with a new debate platform called Kialo which might be a nice pattern for structuring and adding rigor to arguments which happen so often between BTC and BCH.

This is just a proof of concept at this point. As a starting point, last weekend I asked for some of your arguments [in favor of Bitcoin Cash's scaling approach](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/upbpzn/for_or_against_bitcoin_cash_has_a_better_scaling/). (Yes, this is just one side, but it's primarily for testing at this point.)

I tried to build out some of the claims which lead up to the above argument, while also adding some support for/against underneath. Hopefully, this illustrates the platform's capability.

I've included a link which anyone can use to make comments and suggestions to the discussion. If this experiment goes well, I will continue to add to it as well as open it up to the public for further contributions/discourse.

Please share feedback on all aspects of this. Any feedback about the arguments themselves should be added to Kialo. Any meta feedback should go in this thread. Eager to hear your thoughts, r/btc. üçª

Nov 25 2018 - march31 2019
 
March 08 2020 -march 15 2020

so 6% of the past 5 years has it been below current prices.

The Winklevoss twins spent 11M on 100k Bitcoin and became crypto billionaires. BCH is cheap enough that 100k BCH still costs 19M, so probably some smart whales are buying during the recent crash and will be next next crypto billionaires.

With BCH at record low prices it seems like there are panic sellers taking losses and subsidizing coins below even mining prices over the past 5 years, its unlikely that the sellers have a significant supply to sell at such losses and it is expected they will run dry and cause the market liquidity to dry up as the price recovers.

Historically the price has never stayed in this area long based on market moves over the past 5 years.

Bitcoin on the other hand was below current prices for 3.5 years of the past 5 years (at all times prior to DEC 2020) so 70% of the past 5 years Bitcoin has been lower, and sellers might still be in profit to a large degree.",23,btc,2022-05-22 00:24:49
uv2t3z,QuantumLeapChicago,10,https://redd.it/uv2t3z,üíµ Adoption,Bitcoin Pizza Day failure (for the first time in 5 years),"Hello friends.

Every year on May 22 I use Menufy to order a big order for my friends and I to celebrate Bitcoin Pizza day. A few years ago I was able to use ETH, one time I used BTC, but of course my preference is BCH. Aside from 5/22, I occasionally order Chinese takeout from the place up the road. But usually I order pizza from the burbs.

So there are no good pizza places nearby and I didn't want to drive today, I coordinated with my 8 friends and we ordered from a Japanese fusion place we never tried.

Menufy no problem, payment went through right away (gotta love 0-conf).

Delivery time passes, no order. I call the place, say I have a delivery order I'm checking on. The manager mentioned Menufy and details of my order without me providing details (maybe he used caller ID to pull my info?)

Proceeds to say, oh these third party sites don't work well, he never got ""notified"" of my order, besides they are out of 3/4 the things we ordered.

I bitched about having 8 hungry people and obviously he does have my order since he mentioned details. Apologized as I have ran a restaurant before and know how hard it is with Covid especially... But reminded him we checked their actual first party site and stayed away from the things they marked they were out of there. Asked for a refund, he said okay of course.

Ordered pizza from the trusty shop down the road and put it on ye old credit card.

Menufy sent a QA follow-up email. I wrote them back with all the details (including my BCH address) and got an email back within 20 mins saying they'll refund me in 2-3 business days for the USD amount. I trust them to take care of it...

But come on... What a frustrating situation. Friends still all think crypto is a joke. Wonder what the exchange rate will be in a few days (don't really care but again, they're calculating in USD so i might actually get a little more if it keeps sliding down). Mostly wonder if Menufy will actually process a crypto refund. The form letter was not super encouraging.

Despite all this... I'm still gonna SPEDN. This one restaurant is the only time I've had an issue. Tomorrow gonna try again with our sushi place down the road. But a little more legwork... Call them before and make sure they are aware of Menufy.

If anyone knows any good places in Chicago that actually take crypto directly or via bitpay or similar... happy to support them!",14,btc,2022-05-22 03:42:36

Yeah  although I completely understand that this is a legitimate way to make  money there is so much more potential in blockchain and NFT technology  than creating stupid 'artwork' ( usually pictures of apes ) and I don't  even understand why so much hype is being created over it ? Do you ?

I  mean some of these things sell for millions of dollars and after you  purchase them they could be worth zero. I understand that it feels like a   very attractive proposition to the 'artist' making them because he  could potentially earn a lot from very little work but come on.

Do you know what else blockchain can do ?  
For instance there is a project MS Recovery that utilizes blockchain to make a healthcare insurance system,  
Microsoft  is utilizing it to make Digital ID, there is a company called World  Mobile Token that utilizes blockchain to make a network that could in  the future connect the entire African continent, there are limitless  things that can be done and limitless choices where you can invest your  money why on earth would you use it buy dumb shit ?

uw5p55,-ism-isa-con,3,https://redd.it/uw5p55,None,Theory on why u/thethrowaccount21 pursued George Donnelly with name calling and vitriol and flipstarter funders did not afaik; a difference between Dash and Bitcoin Cash,"Thethrowaccount21 has levied accusations against George Donnelly regarding funding received by the latter.  This has to do with two projects: Dash and Bitcoin Cash.

In thethrowaccount21's [post](https://np.reddit.com/r/DashUncensored/comments/uu80oj/george_donnelly_posted_recently_and_blocked_me_so/) there was a lot of name calling.  That's what caught my attention.  Only a slow BCH aficionado myself, I didn't understand the vitriol.  It took a bit of back and forth, but u/thethrowaccount21 eventually explained to me that they were not involved in the flipstarter, but they come from Dash project, where funds are handled very differently than they are in Bitcoin Cash.

In Bitcoin Cash world, a person who funds a flipstarter campaign **takes upon himself or herself a significant degree of personal risk**, since nobody else makes the decision to contribute.  A BCH-flipstarter-funder thus only has himself or herself to blame for that decision, which causes them to assume a degree of responsibility.

Dash funding of projects, meanwhile, is handled differently.  Maybe I'm wrong about this, and if I am someone please correct me, but afaik none of the contributors to George Donnelly in the Dash project incurred any personal risk.  Those funds were already gone from their own wallets.  Someone else made the decision, using funds in another wallet.

What I'm [trying to say](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/uu82ff/george_donnelly_posted_recently_asking_to_come/i9o2n4i/) is, when funding is handled such as it is in Bitcoin Cash BCH -- voluntarily -- that may actually help us all treat each other with a just little bit more humanity, by encouraging everyone to assume responsibility for their own actions.

uwcgyj,Sugarbird676,12,https://redd.it/uwcgyj,None,I think it‚Äôs about more than just Store of Value and Means of Exchange,"You will often see the debate about bitcoin being a store of value or a means of exchange, and which of those needs to come first, or which is more fundamental. But MoE and SoV are just qualities that sound money needs to have. They do not address competition between currencies.

I think the fallacy is the idea that you can successfully compete with the dollar by being ‚Äúbetter‚Äù than the dollar in some way. But fiat currencies don‚Äôt compete on value or quality. Fiat currencies have value because citizens are forced to pay taxes with fiat, and this incentivized (forces) them to trade things of value for fiat dollars.

So IMO, any crypto has to have a use case that cannot be performed with fiat online. (I think for BCH, this is tipping.) 

If you try to compete by being better than fiat on its own turf, you run into the ‚Äúbad money drives good money off the market‚Äù problem.

One more thing- people often make the argument, ‚ÄúWhy would you spend bitcoin when it could 10x next year?‚Äù But in the next breath, they say, ‚Äú..and why would someone accept it when it might plunge?‚Äù I think the issue is basically that volatility adds an element of speculation to normal buying and selling.

Its easily scalable by adding more HDFS nodes. Eg: your current HDFS capacity is 3TB. You can easily add 3 raspi of 1TB each to give total capacity of 6TB.

In marketing term this is effectively unlimited linearly scalable storage. The raspi hardware doesn't need to improve for you to increase your storage capacity.

HDFS is proven tech. Its the open source equivalent of Google's GFS. Its free to use. It can be used by businesses big and small. Large enterprises can add massive servers to their HDFS storage. Enthusiasts can add Raspi to extend their HDFS storage.

How does this relate to Bitcoin?  When running a Bitcoin node your datadir is generally on the local filesystem.  If instead of specifying the local filesystem you specified HDFS, storage is no longer an issue. In fact, storage was never a technical area of concern.

uww3nw,mrtest001,10,https://redd.it/uww3nw,None,"""Bitcoin"" is a system of incentives. From this principle I have a prediction of how even 100GB blocks could potentially be handled by ""Bitcoin"".","Imagine 2 miners.  

One is ""ideologically pure"" 

> Every byte of every transaction that ever was needs to be on the blockchain forever.

Well, just the fees alone make this a non-issue as far as maintenance.  but if we play devil's advocate and say ""we might run out of space someday..."" , ok.  

So how does ""Bitcoin incentive"" play in?

The 2nd miner only keeps history of, say, the last year only - and everything before that is pruned of all spent ""outputs"".

Both miners will be able to validate transactions - but operation costs for the 2nd miner is far less.

Will the 2nd miner worry that the chain might be rolled back 1 year? Nah - if a blockchain being used by most of the world can still be rolled back by 1 year, Bitcoin might as well be considered dead.

So i don't think Bitcoin needs to get a ""protocol change"" ever to optimize for future large block storage.

I think each miner will naturally prune their data to keep costs down.

(edit: if 1 year seems short, make it 10 years - no problem)

The ""incentive"" here is that a miner is not rewarded for keeping ALL the data, because ""pruned"" miners are just as good at validating as ""full"" miners.  ""Just as good"" being 99.9<repeating many many times>%

In fact, it is not possible to fake a transaction because all the hashes must match up.

(edit: This is where I am going off on a tangent)

Can someone please explain why pruned blockchain is not the ""standard operating procedure""?  Why is *anyone* keeping full blockchain data?

Each unspent transaction has its hash included in the hash-tree that leads to the block's hash - you cannot fake a transaction without being able to come up with dozens of hashes that when hashed give you the block hash.",20,btc,2022-05-24 17:26:06

uxfu9b,LovelyDayHere,81,https://redd.it/uxfu9b,ü§î Opinion,"As a Bitcoin Cash supporter, here is how I view the rise of Monero.","I got into [Bitcoin](https://bitcoin.com/bitcoin.pdf) a number of years ago, before the block size wars, before Bitcoin Cash existed. Back when BTC could still pass as the ""peer to peer electronic cash"".

I believe financial privacy is important - when someone tells you privacy is dead, they are usually ignorant about the possibilities of strong cryptography and how it protects against exploitation (by criminals, by foreign governments, even by one's own government) or they are knowingly or unknowingly assisting psychological operations intended to reduce peoples' awareness of privacy as a right and frankly, something worth having and achievable if we engage ourselves for it.

So, I do like Monero's emphasis on privacy by default, while at the same time I like Bitcoin (now Bitcoin Cash) for its default transparency and making privacy available to those who want it (through e.g. CashFusion). I know some Monero people strongly disagree and believe that privacy is not achievable through opt-in. But I think this is not a settled matter. Combinatorics and pseudonymity at large scale (millions / billions of people using Bitcoin) can make compromise of financial privacy very costly.

However, that's not my main point here.

I want to make the point that the rise of Monero is good for all of p2p electronic cash.

Firstly, it proves that there is some market interest in privacy. This is encouraging. Privacy does not come for free! Work has to be done to make it happen, and that work costs money. (This is also why I'm fine with people who have privacy use cases, paying extra for those, even on BCH through layered protocols such as CashFusion, or in the future perhaps, sidechains where all transactions are private similar to Monero).

Secondly, it shows that even if a p2p cash coin has dropped by a lot in the past (I read that Monero had dropped down to even 50th spot?) there is potential for the coin to rise substantially.

The higher p2p cash coins rise compared to others, the better it will be for economic freedom and human rights (incl. privacy) in the world.

So I say to the Monero community: Well done, thanks for sticking to your guns, there is a long way ahead but the Bitcoin Cash community is fighting along side you for decentralized p2p cash, with complementary features.

I don't think it's a zero sum game at all.",77,btc,2022-05-25 12:03:55

uyl6qv,Ok_Aerie3546,33,https://redd.it/uyl6qv,‚å® Discussion,Does store of value need utility?,"I had fun last time I posted a bitcoin maxi ama. The people here actually gave good points, were understanding and just a good experience overall.

So I want to discuss the title with you guys today. Other communities are very closed minded or just end up making snide remarks.

Ill set up the discussion as I understand it, feel free to give me your points.

Lets pick a few non sovereign store of values that have held their value for long periods of time (so not counting bubbles like beanie babies, tulips and nfts).

Gold, silver, diamonds, pearls, corals, rolexes, vintage cars, memorabilia, pokemon cards.

Now out of these only gold and silver became money and the rest just became store of values and some even stopped being that.

Ill give examples

- Silver, during industrial revolution had shot up in demand. A lot of applications needed silver. Much more than gold. This caused industries to invest heavily in silver mining and considerably reduced the scarcity of silver. Since then silver has been devaluing against gold.

- Diamonds and pearls lost their scarcity when humans figured out how to manufacture/ culture them. The diamond industry formed a cartel to maintain scarcity of real and artificial diamonds. This let diamonds to stay expensive and the cartel to profit. Pearls have been falling in demand and price this whole time.

- rolexes, vintage cards, art and pokemon cards are the most ""security like"". They need to be verified by a third party and are neither accessible nor do they have a liquid market. But still they go up in price just for their scarcity.

Gold has continued to be the sov of choice due to its global supply, fungibility, liquidity, etc.

Now as I see it there are two types of buyers in these markets:

- Industrial buyers: These people buy gold to use it in their products. The gold in these products rarely ever comes back on the market. This includes electronics, lab equipment, chemical industries, decorative things like gold foil.

- Exchanges: These are the people who buy gold only to sell to other people. They can make the gold into jewelry, coins, bars only to sell them at different premiums. They also buy peoples jewelry, coins and bars at different discounts from people. These are the coinbases of the gold world.

Now out of all the gold that exists in the world,

- 10 percent gold is in all our devices. Inside these devices the gold is worth more than regular gold. Example: even if an iphone has gold in it, you are better off selling the iphone than extracting the gold to sell.

- 90 percent. This is what I call the hoarders. They buy gold in various forms and then hoarde it for life. They hold this to either display their wealth or to protect themselves from a doomsday scenario. We also have central banks in this group as they only use it for settlements and nothing productive. The regular population are purely hoarders and never sell this gold for more than what its worth in gold.

The industrial buyers are essentially short gold, as if they are able to source gold cheap, it would increase their profit margins. Example: an iphones price doesnt change because gold got cheaper, so just the profit margins improve.

The other buyers and hoarders are essentially long gold. Jewelers charge a percentage of gold value as ""making charges"" and the hoarders gain when gold price goes up.

So now my question is which faction of buyers make gold a good sov. Id argue its the holders and not the industries. Sure industries would give gold a price floor. But the holders make the number go up.

So now my conclusion is for a sov to be a sov and its number to go up, you just need a constant group of hoarders that keep addiing more and more gold to their stash. 

In other words sovs dont need utility to stay sovs.

uypw9t,JoyradProcyfer,23,https://redd.it/uypw9t,None,Why Bitcoin Cash Will Fail In Spite Of Being Superior To Bitcoin,"# IPv4 aka The Internet As We Know It

We use IPv4. It is the basis of the Internet as we know it, for now (yes, IPv6 is being used by some and is expected to replace it).

# IPv5 -What Could Have Been

IPv5 is an objectively superior technology to IPv4. IPv5 would have made certain things such as streaming faster.

IPv5 died because nobody used it. Its lack of popularity killed it. A superior technology, ignored because no one else was using it, and therefore because no one was using it, no one else used it since it lacked enough people to be worthwhile.

# Bitcoin Cash -What Could Have Been

IPv5 reminds me of Bitcoin Cash.

Bitcoin Cash is a superior technology to Bitcoin. It makes transfers cheaper. It is a slightly sleeker code, but otherwise very simple.

Bitcoin Cash has been down tremendously from its ATH. While it has not completely died and is superior to most coins out there, it has ultimately died compared to its previous trajectory and the reality it has no realistic chance of regaining its former potential to overtake Bitcoin.

Bitcoin Cash in other words, is superior, but its lack of popularity has created a cycle of it not being adopted, just like what happened to IPv5.

# IPv6 -What Is Inevitable

IPv6 on the other hand is gaining steam and is 100% expected to replace IPv4 -but why? IPv6 essentially does tons of things, far more than IPv5 did, that elevate IPv4. It improves Internet speeds, Internet security, and increases the number of IPs one can add to IPv6 drastically compared to IPv4 and IPv5.

In other words, IPv6 will achieve what IPv5 did not, simply because it is a little more. It does a little more.

In fairness, a new IP version was not as pressing a few years ago, given that we had more IP addresses left to allocate to computers a few years ago, and thus were not as in-need of a new protocol, so all of this logic COULD be a moot point in this regard.

However, I believe IPv6 was going to be shifted to even if we were not running out of space. Simply put, it offers so much more than IPv5, that it is not merely superior, but IMMENSELY superior.

# Why Bitcoin Cash Will Likely Fail

Bitcoin Cash is superior to Bitcoin because it does exactly what Bitcoin does but with a lower cost.

This is completely, 100%, true.

But I need you all to understand a simple truth, too.

Superior, is not good enough for a social shift in power -MASSIVELY superior, will only move the needle just barely enough, for a social shift in power.

There are systems superior to present politics in varied Western countries, that do not gain traction because they lack enough popularity for people to bother switching to them. Liberalism, in its traditional context of overthrowing monarchism, did not happen for a very long time; not just because of militant oppression, but also because most did not think this or similar alternative systems to monarchy would actually prove effective, even if the idea was out there. Only when it proved abundantly necessary did people jump ship from monarchism to liberalism -they did not do so merely because it looked fun.

Bitcoin Cash is not going to become popular enough to surpass Bitcoin, because it just does not do enough to justify an entire social movement from one major currency to another, even if Bitcoin Cash is otherwise better. It is in other words, while superior, not superior enough to justify a massive socio-crypto-market shift. 

You have to be multiple leagues better, for people to trust that everyone else, will eventually shift to you -it is otherwise socially just not worth the likely doomed-to-fail inorganic campaigning and social influence required to convince people to perform that shift.

Even Ethereum at least tries to be a leap forward by doing something original that could prove to have some immensely useful benefits to programmers, even if it is a mountain of spaghetti code.

Bitcoin is a leap forward compared to its predecessor -banks.

Bitcoin Cash is a step forward compared to its predecessor -Bitcoin.

**Bitcoin Cash is not a leap forward from Bitcoin, though.**

That is why Bitcoin Cash will fail.",0,btc,2022-05-27 04:19:25

How can a doubling or tripling of price be justified (assuming the price represents the market value of 1 bitcoin) wherein there is no doubling or tripling of the ""intrinsic value""? Basically, it seems to me like the price has ""de-pegged"" from any coherent valuation model and that the price is just increasing over time arbitrarily due to market forces, rather than on it becoming more useful, more purposeful, or more ubiquitous. 

If bitcoin became the ""world reserve currency"" then maybe it has justification to increase in value every decade forever and approach ""infinite price"" which happens pretty quickly on a logarithmic graph/chart for an asset which has compounding growth. 

Basically, 99% of my focus today is on hearing 1 or 2 really solid answers to the title question please.

**TL;DR:** Does modern bitcoin (BTC) investment rely on hope that the following statement is always true? ""Bitcoin will be worth more in 10 years than it's value today""? ü§î",0,btc,2022-05-27 13:34:16

So no, I disagree I won‚Äôt sit and relax while the experiment is being butchered by rent-seekers and usurpers, Bitcoin has very intricate Game Theory parameters and the hash-rate provided by miners is literally the solution to the previously unsolved Byzantine fault. 

So to assume that ‚Äúpeople will mine just to make sure the system keeps going‚Äù in an incentives-heavy system is not only wishful thinking and gambling, it‚Äôs a pure uneducated approach to experimentation and systems scaling.

L2 and LN do not solve the Byzantine fault, if LN worked we won‚Äôt even need Bitcoin nor mining. All this proof of stake and L2 scaling and all those new experiments taking place might or might not fail, but everything similar to them previously failed (see banks, liberty dollar, etc) so anecdotal evidence suggests that the only safe bet is Bitcoin, on-chain, exactly as Satoshi created and left it.

Adam Back and Charlie are charlatans, one is selling Liquid and rent-seeking solutions , the other just wants to copy said rent-seeking solutions like he unimaginatively copied Bitcoin.

The Bitcoin network saw a change of -4.33% in the hashrate on 2022-05-25, the biggest negative percentage change in the recent 10 months. As the price fluctuates to around $30,000, the past 2-week cycle was recorded with the mining revenues of $0.12 per 1 TH/s.

More ASICs approach their breakeven prices. At the time of writing, miners with unit power of 60W/T could barely generate profits since the electricity cost rate was around 95%, and the cost rate for miners with a unit power above 65 W/T was more than 100%. This means that their electricity costs had exceeded the revenues that could be brought by the miners at the power rate of $0.08 per kWh.

Do you think Litecoin holders would want to hear of a Bitcoin that is not Core, which is being recognized as the real Bitcoin and puts Litecoin on the list of redundant coins?

Do you think Ethereum holders would like to hear that a real Bitcoin works and can do everything ETH does and is much cheaper without waiting years for the supposed Ethereum 2.0m years to wait?

Bitcoin Cash is not supported by many because it makes their projects redundant or, I would say, repetitive and useless.

v85j9u,thethrowaccount21,72,https://redd.it/v85j9u,‚å® Discussion,"As a Bitcoin Cash supporter, why I feel the rise of Monero is bad for the ecosystem","Recently there was a post on this subreddit concerning Monero, titled [As a Bitcoin Cash supporter, here is how I view the rise of Monero.](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/uxfu9b/as_a_bitcoin_cash_supporter_here_is_how_i_view/).

I wanted to write a reply back then but I was so busy that it slipped my mind. So I'm going to write it here instead. The sentiment around Monero in this subreddit has definitely changed in the last couple years, and while it may seem like a good thing, I believe that its not. Monero used to be widely panned in this subreddit, mainly because for years the monero community engaged in bad acting and disingenuous behavior, similar to what George Donnelly has engaged in. The most important thing is that the monero community relies on misunderstandings to survive. For example, monero has infinite inflation and claims this is 'to secure the network'. Or the fact that the supply of monero is completely unauditable. 

One specific example of this behavior is they lie about the 'IRS bounty' as if having an open bounty is some mark of privacy. When in fact, that bounty has been paid out nearly TWO YEARS ago to two different companies [Chainalysis and Integra Win $1.25 Million IRS Contract to Break Monero](https://news.bitcoin.com/chainalysis-and-integra-win-1-25-million-irs-contract-to-break-monero/)

Another example of this behavior is this thread I posted from two years ago [While they flood this sub with their shilling and tipbot, the Monero community ROUTINELY LIES about Bitcoin Cash to newbies! ](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/ckophg/while_they_flood_this_sub_with_their_shilling_and/). In that thread I exposed the fact that while Monero advocates and members were beginning to flood this subreddit with sycophantic comments, in their actual subreddit they were attacking Bitcoin Cash and spreading lies about this community.

Also, another thread I posted 4 years ago exposing Monero's bad acting and terrible tokenomics was well-received here as well, indeed I was requested to post that thread by a member of this community:

[Reasons You May Want To Avoid Monero - Posting By Request](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7k1b00/reasons_you_may_want_to_avoid_monero_posting_by/)

My point isn't to necessarily rehash those old topics. Rather its to contend that ""the rise"" of Monero is actually bad for the cryptocurrency space and BCH as a whole. The monero community often engages in shilling and bribery of key positions in communities in order to not say anything bad about their coin. Even though there's a lot of bad that can be said about it. 

Strictly speaking, Monero's privacy is heavily flawed and ineffective. Monero's privacy was broken for **at least** the first four years of its existance, and in fact Monero's privacy still doesn't work. u/Rucknium himself posted research on the OSPEAD attack that is barely 7 months old that he claims is an untenable sacrifice of user privacy.

[Developer of OSPEAD here. AMA!](https://www.reddit.com/r/xmrtrader/comments/pzsd27/developer_of_ospead_here_ama/)

>What I'm saying here is: (1) Fix the statistical issues of ring signatures to the maximum possible extent, or **(2) accept that user privacy will be compromised**, or (3) **move to a completely different model.** You may be interested in some recent discussions in #monero-community IRC/Matrix regarding the feasibility and advisability of doing (3) eventually. Meanwhile, I am working on (1). To me, (2) is unacceptable.

So here, the researcher who developed the attack clearly states that it is so severe that the privacy of monero's users is compromised to an unacceptable degree. That is a severe indictment. As a reminder, researchers have shown that Monero's privacy was broken in the past several times in many different ways. Another link:

[Tracing Cryptonote ring signatures using external metadata](https://medium.com/@crypto_ryo/tracing-cryptonote-ring-signatures-using-external-metadata-8e4866810006) 
>##What are the general properties of metadata analysis?

>A single expression that I would use to describe is ‚Äúchurn killer‚Äù. Since the anonymity set provided by a ring signature is fairly small, a very naive and stupid advice would be ‚Äújust send money to yourself a couple times‚Äù. Metadata attack turns churning into incriminating evidence in a scenario where you are trying to prove beyond reasonable doubt that a transaction occurred between Alice and Bob.

>Another interesting property of metadata analysis is that larger ring sizes are more incriminating. It can be only countered with smarter output selection. For one such idea, see section 6.2 here.


>##What can be done to prevent it?

>First of all let‚Äôs get one thing out of the way. No amount of real-time traffic obfuscation will put you in the clear here. **It does not address the root issue ‚Äî that your activity and transaction happening are temporally correlated.**

>**In Monero you are double-screwed. It has a non-constant fee that will leak information on when you signed the transaction, even if you delay its broadcast.**

>Finally the real solution is to have protocol level way whereby the broadcast can be delayed while keeping the transaction anonymous.

In this viral r/btc thread [Thanks to CashShuffle I can finally add Bitcoin Cash to the List! - Cutting to the chase or how to properly evaluate privacy coins! ](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/bbnglh/thanks_to_cashshuffle_i_can_finally_add_bitcoin/) three years ago, I amended my previous work at identifying the strongest privacy coin by their anonymity set. There I showed that Monero actually has one of the weakest anonymity sets of all privacy coins at 11. And the privacy bugs that monero has like those mentioned above, actually DECREASE monero's anon set considerably.

So unlike the original post I referenced in the beginning, I think that ""the rise"" of Monero is a bad sign for the cryptocurrency market in general. Some of the things in that post were true, like you must pay for privacy. But Monero's privacy is the MOST EXPENSIVE per byte! You get one of the smallest anonymity set sizes for the cost, and its privacy is traceable in several different ways which means you're actually paying to have your privacy broken!

The rise of such an anti-tool will only lead to anti-adoption and the destruction of Satoshi's true dream, digital cash for everyone. As I showed in the thread above, its not ""privacy by default"" that matters, rather its the SIZE OF YOUR ANONYMITY SET that determines the strength of a coin's privacy offering. Finally, Monero has infinite inflation which is a definite no-no in cryptocurrency. Satoshi explicitly wanted to get away from the inflation in fiat currencies when he created Bitcoin. 

Monero is a slap in Satoshi's face. Monero also has an extremely bloated chain at over 130GB, this despite having very little adoption or actual usage (I showed with evidence that Monero's recent spike in daily transaction count was just fakery using scripts [Evidence the monero community is faking their recent spike in transactions in order to manipulate their fair value and appear more used than they are](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/bk8b7o/evidence_the_monero_community_is_faking_their/) a post that curiously despite all the vote brigading the Monero community engages in, is still upvoted to this day).

So I wanted to start a dialog on what ""Monero's rise"" *actually means* for cryptocurrencies. I don't think it means anything good.

Bitcoin Cash has been producing new opportunities for people worldwide; you don't have to be rich to use it. With as little as one penny, you can have your account funded and running in no time without having to ask for permission from third-party service providers like Wallet of Satoshi or Strike. Bitcoin Cash is and will continue to be the real Bitcoin that first works as a peer-to-peer currency. And it will become the next programmable money second and store of value because it does its first mission well and cheaply; the other two functions will come as a result of the first.

Been in crypto 5 years do I was entering as the scaling war was happening. I understand all of it way more now but am wondering what the objective rationale was to whale the blocksize at layer 1 in stead of a layer 2 option. 

Reasons why I found was, smaller blocks = can run a full blockchain node with smaller size limit. This is more decentralized in theory and practice. More distributed full nodes = better odds of true consensus of the chain.

* Final edit for future other BCH newbies: 0-conf unconfirmed transactions are perfectly usable. BCH doesn't do fees like other coins, you either paid the min fee or you didn't, you can't get ahead in line. Sometimes the blocks just take a long time. But it doesn't matter because once they've reached ""unconfirmed"" status there is no way they will fail, and they can't be overwritten.

I'm sure other people have thought of this -- are there any ""solutions"" to this ethical dilemma? ü§î","If you remember Columbine, it created the allure of school shootings where none had prior existed. I'm sure if it happened 10 years earlier, that those following 10 years would have had a dozen or more following in its wake. I feel like the same thing could happen if you kidnap a billionaire's son or daughter -- that the first incident will usher in a new wave of it becoming a common occurrence. 

Part of me feels like if the first highly-publicized crypto-ransom is ""unsuccessful"" (i.e. the billionaire refuses to negotiate with kidnappers) then it will have a **[chilling effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chilling_effect)** and somehow discourage future similar incidents. The era of ""ransomware"" is annoying but at least nobody dies. It's an acceptable tradeoff since the net utility of crypto outweighs the harm of cyber-criminals so long as they stick to ""white collar"" crimes only.

What about crypto-terrorism? Let's say you're a shady millionaire who has the financial resources to arrange the importation of 2 ""dirty bombs"" and you detonate one in nowhere-ville Montana and kill 300 people to prove your willingness to detonate the 2nd bomb in a populated area like NYC or LA?

A millionaire could easily 50x his net worth from $20M to $1B and to be honest, I'd even consider it if I were in that financial position. (i.e. your ""party boat"" goes from 35 feet to 200 feet plus unlimited cocaine and half-dressed instagram models at your disposal on epic yacht parties)

v9vweq,Chris_lynn_13,8,https://redd.it/v9vweq,None,Here‚Äôs Why Bitcoin Miners In Texas Are Cutting Down On Power," June witnessed record-breaking power use levels which occurred due to high temperatures in Texas, posing a challenge for the power grid of the state.¬†

According to data from the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, the energy demand setting a record for June reached its peak at 72,386 megawatts on Monday, only to break the next day as the demand rose to 72,785 megawatts. On June 23, 2021, the all-time record was 70,257 MW.

Bitcoin miners entering flocking into the state have raised questions regarding the possible result for its grid. ERCOT, in a statement, said that it expects enough production to meet forecasted demand.

 

A Bitdeer spokesperson through an email informed that they halted operations on June 7 around late in the day and will continue to do so at the time of monitoring usage on the grid as well as rising temperatures.¬†

They further said that when power costs reach certain price points that they will power down by using automated triggers.¬†

Earlier this week, Argo, Bitcoin miner revealed due to various reasons that it had mined¬†25% less bitcoin in May, including the time it had shut off power because of higher temperatures.¬†

Peter Wall, the CEO of Argo, in a video posted on Tuesday, said that in terms of higher temperatures, it is likely to be worth around five Bitcoin. The CEO revealed that they, ‚ÄúWe voluntarily curtailed a couple of times.‚Äù The energy prices increased, then they used that power back to the grid and this happened a couple of times.¬†

Recently, Riot pointed out that it too would like to halt operations this week as the temperature rises.¬†

In a video, published by the firm on May 31,¬† Riot‚Äôs chief commercial officer, Chad Harris stated that they are forecasting ‚Äú100 degrees, 5 days of 100 degrees. (‚Ä¶).‚Äù They will turn the power off and during the time that they are utilizing it, it can be used in the grid itself, hence enabling it to support ‚Äútwo or 300 homes in and around our community.‚Äù

Harry made this statement while at Whinestone facility of the company. The company is forecasted to reach a total capacity of 750 megawatts when completely developed.",3,btc,2022-06-11 11:47:54

Any crypto withdrawal from the Gemini platform that‚Äôs not ETH or an ERC-20 token will instead incur a flat fee.

>These fees are not intended to generate revenue for Gemini. These fees will be used to cover the network fees paid to blockchain miners for your withdrawal transaction. Miners process crypto transactions and secure the network on which those transactions are processed.

>On the Ethereum network, network fees are known as gas fees and are paid in ETH. Gas fees vary over time and by activity, with complex smart contracts and code requiring more gas.

>We understand that free withdrawals have been a popular feature, and appreciate your understanding and willingness to adapt and grow with us.

vaol4a,2q_x,15,https://redd.it/vaol4a,None,Novel bitcoin-cash-faucet using introspection,"' spent the last few days developing and testing a faucet smart contract using the new introspection features from the May 15th hard-fork. 

It's a contract that simply says, ""Send all the money back to this contract in the first output, minus some set amount (1000 by default)."" with the condition, ""you can't spend the contract until a certain number of blocks (1 by default)."" 

This contract allows anyone to do whatever they want with the remaining 1000, provided they also pay the transaction fee from that amount.

It's currently a command line npm package, but a static webpage is in the cards.

It's [on-chain](https://explorer.bitcoinunlimited.info/address/bitcoincash:pq75zmtt8d84nqnxv8vx3wj06mmzlhjnwuwprm4szr), so the infrastructure is just the main Bitcoin Cash chain, or testnet4 if preferred.

Instructions for using are [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bitcoin-cash-faucet#Usage)

It is open source [unlicense] of course: https://github.com/2qx/bitcoin-cash-faucet

Feel free to test it if you want some free BCH or tBCH. 

The fee is estimated, but an also be passed with the `--fee` flag

    npx bitcoin-cash-faucet --address bitcoincash:pq75zmtt8d84nqnxv8vx3wj06mmzlhjnwuwprm4szr --fee 356
    # contract index     # 1

    payout:              - 644
    fee paid:            - 356
    ===================================
    new contract balance:  7576221


If that address has already been used in the current block, can also use as many copies on chain as you'd like using the `--index` flag. The first 30 copies of this contract have been funded with about 189k satoshis each

    npx bitcoin-cash-faucet --index 2  --address bitcoincash:pq75zmtt8d84nqnxv8vx3wj06mmzlhjnwuwprm4szr
    # contract index     # 2

    contract balance:      184909
    payout:              - 848
    fee paid:            - 152
    ===================================
    new contract balance:  183909


It may also be used to get testnet4 coins. Currently only the [first index is funded](https://testnet4.imaginary.cash/address/bchtest:pq75zmtt8d84nqnxv8vx3wj06mmzlhjnwu2n8uh89l), and that can be accessed as shown in the [README](https://github.com/2qx/bitcoin-cash-faucet)

If there is something like this on a different project, I'd be genuinely interested to know about it, for future ideas.

EDIT:

I'm a little miffed that no one with access to a node environment wants or needs free money.

So I did add the flags. 

`--period 1000 --payout 1000000`

See you all in 1000 blocks.

Sorry, I forgot that the price of everything crashes with inflation... \s

As a follow up to the on-chain faucet post from yesterday...

Say instead of tipping random people with a contract, if we wanted to pay a party regularly in the future. And it would be okay if that payment was in bitcoin, cause why not.

Say we want something like an annuity. And since rehypothecation doesn't exist in crypto, real coins are increasing in scarcity relative to fiat currencies with high inflation, so we shouldn't need as much bitcoin later as we do now.

Say we take 1 Bitcoin Cash and just make monthly withdraws from the contract of 0.83%.  That would be more at first, but slowly decrease each payout. Like below:

Since the contract is always doing the exact same thing, the address doesn't change, it doesn't need a state, and the function doesn't even take arguments to pay the party.

&#x200B;

In CashScript it looks like this:

https://preview.redd.it/5ximk8zi3g591.png?width=889&format=png&auto=webp&s=d3b587b2af5fb388cce390993a42fb228df68978

With introspection, the ability to get the total value of the contract, as well as the value of individual outputs makes it fairly straight forward to check that the beneficiary is getting paid \[line 27\] that the remainder of funds are returned to the contract \[line 33\] , and the amounts are correct \[40-41\]

But it's also okay, then if the remainder of funds go anywhere, or toward the fee. So someone (**anyone**) can actually **get paid** (default 3600 sats) to execute the contract on time, on a regular basis, while the beneficiary is enjoying a beautiful summer day on their citadel.

Note: both for simplicity, and because what is considered ""dust"" may be  spendable on the network in the future as fees are decreased, there is  no cutout behavior when the funds near depletion.  It will eventually run out of funds from the fixed executor fees.  In the future, with fractional satoshis and lower fees, the above could be modified to have a fractional executor fee and run much longer.

vblmnk,Cryptofthl,0,https://redd.it/vblmnk,None,A little late but - 3 year anniversary of Crypto for the homeless!," 

Hey guys, I'm the guy running crypto for the homeless. We recently just had our 3 year anniversary (4/28/19 start date) a couple months ago - this post is a little bit late.

For those of you who don't know, crypto for the homeless (CFTHL) is a non-profit organization I created with the intention of doing something unique with crypto while at the same time helping the needy.

I started it completely out of pocket at the start and was able to get the organization of its feet immediately due to the massive support shown from social media (mainly reddit).

I never set out to ""solve"" homelessness, as I think that is a systemic problem that even governments can not fix - but rather to re-introduce a human aspect of charity that I felt was sorely missing from most other projects (at least in my opinion).

We differentiated ourselves by utilizing all of the funds we received thus far on food/goods for the homeless, and also delivering food straight to the homeless/needy. In addition to this, we have photo documentation of all food hand outs as well as receipts dating back to the very first time we handed out food (3+ full years of photos at this point) which I believe no other charity has come close to doing.

While we had very humble beginnings, we are proud to have 501c3 status for 2+ years now, and also recently launched our brand new website [http://cryptoforthehomeless.com](http://cryptoforthehomeless.com/) (check it out).

We also have had a massive amount of volunteer support (people buy and hand out food for us and get reimbursed in crypto). Our partners in New Zealand have been doing the most amazing work consistently for us and I could not be prouder. [https://imgur.com/a/cBoAUNg](https://imgur.com/a/cBoAUNg) \- here is an album of some of their recent work.

In terms of donations, we have received enough (roughly $75,000 thus far) to last us probably a decade or more of work at our current rate (if we ration the spending to maintain our current rate), which I view as a massive success and also a guarantee of our longevity.

I've learned a ton from running this project thus far - and I've used a lot of it to try and improve the project if possible.

1. It is impossible to satisfy 100% of people with ANY project - for this one in particular, there are those who oppose helping homeless people in general and thus they will inherently hate this project no matter what I do.
2. It is impossible to make this project 100% ""trustless"" despite what most people who have that criticism say. It is ultimately a project based on human work, and the best that I/we can do is provide a massive amount of proof of work (which we have) that should be used as a basis of our legitimacy. At this point, having 3+ years of photos as well as documenting over $20,000 donations in monero should be more than enough proof of our legitimacy (in addition to reimbursing 100% of our volunteers who participated properly).
3. A lot of people want to steer the project in many different directions - ultimately the project's design is a very personal thing when it comes down to it. I personally created it with a very specific vision in mind - and that may not align with what you(or other people) feel the best vision is. That is perfectly fine - and you/they are free to create a project to carry out that vision in the same way I have carried out mine. Projects like this cost time/money and the very fact that enough supporters on the internet have funded this project to last us 10+ years now at least shows that we have a reason to exist. I am beyond grateful for this support and intend to respect the intentions of our donors for the extreme long term.

Which brings us to future plans -

We currently have a couple people including myself dedicating quite a lot of time each day working on the websites/social media/communicating with volunteer prospects/etc. There are actually a lot of things that occur behind the scenes that are very time consuming and we could use 1 or 2 more people working with us on the team on various things (social media/engagement/etc). This is one of our top priorities right now - so if this is something you can see yourself doing - please reach out to me, even if the amount of time you can commit is small!

Also, as I have stated earlier - we are proud of the fact that all of the funds thus donated to us have been entirely dedicated to the buying and reimbursing of food/goods for the homeless (and I intend to keep it that way). One repeated suggestion that I have had was to pay our employees for their time, even minimal. Because of our pledge to not use the funds for that purpose at the start, we had to come up with a different solution which is as follows:

[https://www.flowcode.com/page/lmcfthl](https://www.flowcode.com/page/lmcfthl) \- these are wallets we set up for the sole purpose of optional support to provide our employees (again this is just to have the option there - we absolutely do not require anything to continue to operate, but if you want to support the employees that have been working completely free since the start this is the way to do it).

That about sums it up for now - I hope we met/exceeded the expectations of those of you who have followed us from the beginning - if not, we will try even harder going forward. Feel free to post any and all criticism/suggestions/support/anything and we will take it all in!",5,btc,2022-06-13 20:30:36

It's also the one with more daily TXS, with +4.5K transactions registered in the last 24 hours.

It doesn't surprise me as the platform itself has a wide variety of tools such as the classic swap, farming, staking and a bridge. People from other chains try smartBCH with the solely purpose of using MistSwap.

I wonder how far it will go, what do you guys think?

vc60t6,Hurry-Zealousideal,3,https://redd.it/vc60t6,‚å® Discussion,Market Cycles - Bitcoin Halving,"After 6 years in the crypto market and thousands of hours learning how to trade full time, this is by far the most important information I‚Äôve found for anyone investing in crypto and for some reason I very rarely see it mentioned 

The bitcoin halving 

This is what the previous bitcoin market cycles have ALL been based around 

This is an event that happens roughly every 4 years and essentially halves the rewards given to miners causing an inherent increase in demand as the cost of mining a bitcoin doubles. 

Why this doesn‚Äôt get talked about more often is something I really don‚Äôt understand

The reason crypto doesn‚Äôt just go up forever is because markets are cyclical
The markets are cyclical because eventually, everyone who was going to buy, has 
And then the most money to be made is to the downside

I don‚Äôt care how many times I hear Blackrock Vanguard Microsoft Google PayPal Visa Elon Musk China El Salvador John McAfee bulls*it

BTC(and every other market‚Ä¶)has always followed a pattern

1.Accumulation
(Slow sideways low volatility market for 3-6 months at the lows) this always starts about 12 months before the bull run 

2.Mark up (bull market) usually starts about 6 months before the halving 

3.Distribution (where the sellers start re entering the market, you can spot this through volume) 
Usually about 1 year after the halving 

4. Mark down phase (this is where we‚Äôre at now) - where retail traders keep anticipating the bottom and getting sh*t on over and over again until we get closer to the halving 

Then back to accumulation 

After a huge sentiment killing bear market, BTC will sit in a low volatility sideways accumulation zone at the lows as the big boys scoop as much BTC as they can for as little as possible. 
(This gives you PLENTY of time to position)

It doesn‚Äôt make sense for them to just run the market straight up because then the big boys need to pay more for their BTC.

In order for them to keep BTC at them lows they need to kill retail sentiment beforehand so that retail doesn‚Äôt rush into the market and drive prices up before they‚Äôre ready to run BTC up.

The way they do this is by doing exactly what we‚Äôre seeing now

‚ÄúBtc has never gone under previous cycles ATH, 200 weekly MA etc etc etc‚Äù 

So buyers rush in at these levels just to get crushed again 

Then they‚Äôll do the same thing at 15k

And probably the same thing once again at 10k

This is to disenchant retail buyers, kill sentiment and elude to the fact that once again ‚Äúcrypto is dead‚Äù

After the market has been driven down so hard that the majority of investors lose interest (and money) then the big boys will start accumulating at the lowest prices possible 

This will only happen once the majority of retail has stopped providing liquidity on the other side of the trade for the big boys to sell into 

In other words, we need to get SO low that no one wants to touch BTC anymore

THEN, we get close to the halving and enter a mark up phase.

After the halving BTC will then cost more to mine and so it provides the perfect catalyst to start pushing up the market 

The markup phase is when the market starts to run up hard, regaining retail traders attention and positive news articles etc 

Anyway there‚Äôs a little bit more to understanding liquidity and institutional positioning but most of you don‚Äôt really care about any of that 

HOW DOES THIS MAKE YOU MONEY?
Be real, you didn‚Äôt buy cumrocket and shiva because you‚Äôre ‚Äúin it for the tech‚Äù

The way you make money out of this is very simple

Markets work in phases and these are actually very easily identifiable 

there are 4 phases 

Accumulation
Mark up 
Distribution 
Mark down

Accumulation generally has 3 sub phases 

Accumulation
Expansion 
Reaccumulation

If you‚Äôre worried about trying to catch a falling knife then you just need to wait for the first leg of expansion and enter in the reaccumulation zone

These accumulation zones are very easily identifiable because they‚Äôre low volatility, low volume, sideways ranges at the bottom of a massive move down 

You‚Äôll know when BTC is in an accumulation phase because 95% of this group will cease to be active or only pop their head in to tell you how much of an idiot you are 

This shows you maximum pain is here and is the perfect time for the big boys to accumulate 

Below is a chart i made at the start of this market cycle showing how you can identify the structure to see where we‚Äôre at

As you can see, we haven‚Äôt even started to enter an accumulation phase we‚Äôre still very much in the ‚Äúbear market‚Äù mark down phase 

You‚Äôre not missing anything 

Relax and make sure you‚Äôve got some capital left over for the supreme lows 

And before anyone says ‚Äùno one can pick a bottom‚Äù

vcry6l,bastion333,15,https://redd.it/vcry6l,None,My theory of why bitcoin is crashing and how anyone could have easily predicted it,"When bitcoin was created, interest rates dropped to an 'emergency rate' of 0.5% and then stayed low for much longer than it should have e.g. the emergency was over but they kept rates low anyway.

&#x200B;

The second part of the picture was very soon after bitcoin launched. Central banks began the new process of quantitative easing, which effectively devalues the currency over time because it creates new money out of thin air.

&#x200B;

The easy money policies of ultra low 'emergency interest rates' and the never before tested quantitative easing lead to investors fleeing cash, looking anywhere to get a good return. Enter bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. This is the same driving force behind the real estate boom.

&#x200B;

When this all started in 2009 there was very little inflation and the expectation was that there was a risk of deflation, not inflation.

&#x200B;

So despite the warnings and constant votes against policy from fed rate setter Thomas Hoenig, who believed that the ultra easy money policies would bring back inflation, the fed ignored him and kept stoking inflation: [https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2021/12/28/inflation-interest-rates-thomas-hoenig-federal-reserve-526177](https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2021/12/28/inflation-interest-rates-thomas-hoenig-federal-reserve-526177)

I recommend reading the Thomas Hoenig article.

&#x200B;

It's no coincidence that bitcoin started another bull run soon after the pandemic started. As a result of the pandemic, central banks once again cut rates to near 0 and began even larger quantatitive easing rounds. Bitcoin and stocks had a long bull run as a consequence of those policies.

&#x200B;

Those policies were probably a mistake. Inflation was probably already primed to return, after the past 10-12 years of easy money. The pandemic lockdowns plus the latest round of ultra low rates and 'money creation' was the trigger that brought inflation back, with a vengeance. I theorised all of this would happen at the start of the pandemic.

&#x200B;

That's the main reason I stayed out of crypto. And when Plan B was accurately predicting the price of bitcoin for several months straight last year, I just knew it was going to end badly. He would be correct the first several times but then it would go badly wrong at the end and people would lose their money. There's a valuable lesson in that, about not investing more than you can afford to lose. And not taking financial advice on twitter.

&#x200B;

In case there is anyone who hasn't figured out the obvious yet, crypto is crashing because the ultra easy money policies of central banks seem to really be coming to an end. If this is the case, the market will suffer also. The market has come to believe the fed will always bail it out, that's probably why it hasn't totally crashed yet. Maybe the market will be right, and the fed will chicken out on ending easy money e.g. ultra low rates + quantatitive easing.

&#x200B;

The way things are looking, interest rates are going to have to go up a lot. And the quantatitive easing experiement certainly has to be finished with. If anything, quantatitive tightening is what comes next. It will do exactly as it says, money will become tighter.

&#x200B;

TLDR: The easy money days of the past 10-12 years are likely gone and they are not likely to come back. If that is the case, it's going be a long crypto winter.",5,btc,2022-06-15 11:04:10

1) It needs to stress that current BCHers were previously BTCers, and some of the earliest adopters of BTC too. We voiced and voiced and voiced our opinions and were left with no other option than to split. 

2) It needs to get the point across that 90% of BTC miners supported segwit2x and that SINCE BTC is **centralized** with node development bitcoin core was able to withhold the change.

3) I think illustrating that increasing the blocksize is what Satoshi literally said Bitcoin should do and maybe quoting Gavin (who satoshi gave the keys too) saying Bitcoin Cash is what he was working on is good material.

Fucking losers... trying to blame roger for a spam attack on the BTC network for months on end, when in reality it was just normal people who were told by the media Bitcoin would make them rich.

At first I was annoyed, as I was always pretty careful in that sub not to mention other coins etc.. but banned for propaganda when they actually reply with propaganda themselves.

It's best I'm banned, as I have nothing positive or good to say to the people in that ponzi scheme fucked up and deluded sub. Bunch of fakes and pretenders who ban merchants for telling the truth.

veelup,big--if-true,27,https://redd.it/veelup,‚å® Discussion,All these Bitcoin companies in the news going bankrupt are the reason BCH lost the blocksize fork until now. Companies took out billions in loans and bet it all on Bitcoin despite its small blocksize. Now they are bankrupt.,"They cant compete. So they resort to censorship on forums. Somehow billionaires and companies with billions in loans all flocked to it and are now majorly at huge losses that they cant offload onto anyone.

Even If Bitcoin doesnt go down, eventually microstrategy for example will have to close their position at huge losses. Margin call is bad for them, but so is just being in a bad trade using billions in loans.

Its just such a simple basic thing to realize that small blocks do not make sense. Big blocks are simple and so obvious. Do we use 1mb floppy disks today? Or massive SSD's?....

Speculators in Bitcoin are waiting for more new companies to offer 20% APR and then use all the money to pump Bitcoin. Its a terrible mechanism and might not occur.

Utility will win in the long run over the ponzi scam methods.

Big blocks actually work and can add utility to the world to compete with FIAT. FIAT has a built in tax called inflation.

Bitcoin-Cash (BCH), has that utility, which will win in the long run. Adoption has occured in places where they actually care about having low fees for regular spending such as in Queensland in Australia and many islands in the Caribbean.

Now we are finally hearing about all the companies who propped up Bitcoin against BCH and made it seem like Bitcoin won.

Now they are all bankrupt and we are finding out besides the massive loans many took out, they also used their users funds to gamble on Bitcoin without their consent.",35,btc,2022-06-17 14:35:22

Miners have no incentive to keep ""really old"" spent outputs.  So they will naturally not keep them.  The blockchain will not grow infinitely as it will always be pruned of old spent transactions.

""old spent transactions"" might be defined by some miners as a spent transactions buried under 3 years of blocks.

Welcome.,"When ""they"" said that Bitcoin was about it's censorship resistance they were lying to you. Cause they are grifters, con man, liars, thieves and crooks. All of them. And they have long controlled the narrative on crypto to steal from you. But Bitcoin Cash is different, we don't believe in getting rich without working our asses off to create true value for the world. Getting rich without working is impossible unless you are banker or a landlord. But banks have utility cause the money they peddle is needed in society cause it's a medium of exchange. Without it no buying or selling, just trading. Landlords are not really needed but even they provide some form of utility. You can live in a house. It's nice when it rains or is really cold ouside to have a warm house.

Crypto does not produce anything but /r/buttcoin drama. 

The ONLY possible value crypto can have is in it's utility as a medium of exchange.

Right now that utility is lower then in 2016 there for the true market cap of all of crypto should be below a 100 billion. That means to get back to reality we have to lose another 700 billion of made up bullshit.

The lightning network does not work, can't work, will never work and is just snake oil being sold.

Ethereum can't scale and proof of stake is not long term sustainable. Even if they could  scale all attempts to do so would be sabotaged anyways.

BCH has the most resilient community, coin, network and ecosystem. Does not mean it can't be taken down. But it's going to be harder then anything else out there. 

So now you are realizing there are crypto houses build on sand and crypto houses build on rock.
BCH is build on rock. Okay well maybe it's clay. But it's not sand.

There is a little water now and everything else is washing away.

But not BCH. Why?

Cause Bitcoin either has value or it does not. If it does not eventually BCH will also be washed away. If it does BCH has more value.

Pretty simple logic reasoning which explains why there seems to be an organic BCH price floor of about 100 to 110 dollars. 

This means that BCH is truly worth a couple of billion dollars. Cause it's the community t hat are collectively saying: I am buying at these prices. And all these people have a reasoning for doing so.

On anything else crypto (except monero) there is just sentiment, not reasoning. 

So stop trying to get rich and come build with us. It's a more fulfilling life and we build something of value there WILL be a well deserved reward. And you deserve a community where if things are shit you can say they are shit without some assholes removing your opinion even during a bull market.

The only reason why /r/cryptocurrency and r/bitcoin mods allow you to shit on crypto right now is cause they are now all short and make more money on reversing sentiment. These two subs are completely useless and you deserve better. You deserve to be taken seriously as an adult. Your questions deserve to be awnsered and you deserve to get some real knowledge that will serve you and your local community in this rapidly changing highh tech enviroment. /r/cryptocurrency and /r/bitcoin are there to DEPRIVE you of knowledge.

The only real coins in this case are the ones that a customer wants to withdraw. The same that happened in the vaults of the ancient goldsmiths lending out more certificates than they had gold. No one is the wiser until a mass withdrawal.

If something like this does happen, then it invalidates the ""21 million finite cap"", as untold amounts of bitcoins could be issued in this way to the profit of the exchanges, basically made from counterfeit bitcoins.

What do you think? Is it possible, and if so to what degree?",10,btc,2022-06-21 03:15:47

vht4r5,SoiledCold5,4,https://redd.it/vht4r5,ü§î Opinion,Merge Mining: A way for Bitcoin Cash to become more secure without any major drawbacks.,"Hi everyone,

I was recently reading an article on how Litecoin's and Dogecoin's merge mine with one another and how both chains are very secure for this reason. I was wondering why can't Bitcoin Cash do with Bitcoin Core. Major Bitcoin Core and Bitcoin Cash pools already merge mine with smaller altcoins and it wouldn't be a big problem adding Bitcoin Cash to that list.

Benefits to the Bitcoin Cash network: 

1. Bitcoin Cash can see over 112+ EH/s added to its hashrate if the top 5 bitcoin cash mining pools started to merge mine. Should be noted these pools already merge mine with smaller coins.
2. With more hashrate 0-conf transactions become safer because the risk of 51% attacks is minimized.
3. With the bear market starting miners are earning less than they usually earn, if they start merging mining with Bitcoin Cash they can see a bit more income since Bitcoin Cash creates 900 new coins daily.
4. With more hashrate exchanges will be able to lower the confirmation amount required for Bitcoin Cash deposits making Bitcoin Cash deposits faster.
5. Though this isn't a known fact, usually when the hashrate of major coins go up we also see the price follow along. ([https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/hashrate-price-bch.html#3y](https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/hashrate-price-bch.html#3y))

I haven‚Äôt ever posted on this subreddit but I‚Äôve been monitoring and reading it for a while and have indeed invested in BCH as a result. 

For me, it ticks all the boxes:

- First mover advantage
- Constant new REAL WORLD user adoption 
- Low fees
- Low barriers to entry

The reason I never bought BTC is I just could not see it replacing fiat. 

Regardless, like any opinion mine could be wrong‚Ä¶ but it could be right. I have little technical knowledge of the platform compared to some, but from a business perspective it makes more sense than any other crypto I‚Äôve seen.

vjgy83,i_have_chosen_a_name,20,https://redd.it/vjgy83,üß™ Research,Here is my theory about what happened on Coinflex but there is still a lot I don't understand ....,"1) I heard that about a week ago 90 million dollars worth of BCH/USD perpetual futures liquidity disappeared from Coinflex.  don't have data on this, maybe somebody has it?

2) Coinflex has always communicated that flexusd is backed by 10% USDC and 90% by short and long positions (a hedge) that as far as I know are not with a counterparty but on their own exchange.  Maybe Mark Lamb can correct me if I am wrong about this but this is how I understood it. These where longs and shorts on various coins. BTC, ETH, XRP, Monero, BCH, etc etc. 

3) It has been communicated to me that a big whale with a really big BCH long position on the perpetual  future BCH/USD market went below the value of his colletoral. He should have gotten liquidated by that has not happened yet. (Marc De Mesel? Mike Komaransky? Roger Ver?) 

4) On all the other markets there are lots of buy orders around 115 USD per BCH but hardly any sell orders. 

5) A whale that a couple of days ago still have 6 million flexUSD on smartBCH has been buying up the same amount of BCH that hop.cash offered as a bridge.  If Hop.cash had a 500 BCH buffer this whale would buy 500 sBCH with his flexusd and use the bridge to exit to mainchain.  If hop.cash had a 100 BCH buffer this whale would buy up 100 sBCH and use the bridge.

6) Because the Bitcoin.com wallet has dropped SLP support more and more people are importing their seeds in to EC and are trying to send their flexUSD slp to coinflex. Some will use coinflex to move it on to smartBCH but others might try to redeem it for USDC. That means the last couple of weeks redemption pressure most likely has been higher then before Bitcoin.com dropped slp support. 


4 and 5 clearly shows me that some whales knew something was about to happen on Coinflex. 4 is whales that are waiting for BCH to get dumped by coinflex. 5 is a whale that knew about the issues and was trying to get as much BCH out as possible at any price. 

So let's see if we can figure out the logic flow.

Somebody sends 1000 USDC to coinflex to mint for flexUSD.

Coinflex takes a 100 USDC and puts this appart. 

Coinflex uses  900 USDC to to open two positions with. 

Let's say the price of BCH is at 500.

They short 0.9 BCH by borrowing it on their own market and selling it for 450  USDC. One of their traders that bought it now holds 0.9 BCH and they hold 900 USDC. They owe a lender 0.9 BCH

They long 0.9 BCH by borrowing 450 USDC on their own market and buying 0.9 BCH with it. One of their traders that sold it now holds 450 USDC and coinflex holds 0.9 BCH and 450 USDC. They owe a a lender 450 USDC.

Now the price of BCH goes to a 100 dollars.

Coinflex now holds:

- 100 USDC

- 900 USDC  from the short that can be used to buy  0.9 BCH with to close the short. They owe a lender 0.9 BCH. The cost price for this is 90 USDC. They now have 900 - 90 USDC = 810 USDC


- 0.9 BCH + 450 USDC from the long that can be used to sell for 90 USDC to close the long. They owe a lender 450 USDC. The cost price for this is 450 USDC. They now have  90 USDC. 



100+810+90 USDC = 1000 USDC. 


Now what happens when they can not close a BCH short and long AT THE SAME PRICE? 


Let's have the following scenario:

The order book for BCH has 10 orders in it. 8 and on the buy side (bids at the bottom in green) and two are on the sell side (asks at the top in red) 

The 6 buy orders are:

1 BCH at 100

1 BCH at 90

1 BCH at 80

1 BCH at 70

1 BCH at 60

1 BCH at 50





The 2 sell orders are


sell 0.1 BCH at 101.

Sell 0.8 BCH at 200

On the buy side there is 450 USDC

On the sell side there is 0.9 BCH.


Now the person that gave a 1000 USDC to coinflex and has flexUSD wants to redeem his flexUSD for 1000 USDC.

Coinflex is now going to close their shorts and long. 

First the longs, they have to sell 0.9 BCH at market price. They sell 0.9 BCH for 90 USDC. No problem there.

Now the short side, they have to buy 0.9 BCH at market prices. they can buy 0.1 for 101 and 0.8 for 200. This cost them 10.1+ 160 = 170.1

They are now missing 170.1-90 = 80.1 USDC.

They now only have 919.1 USDC to give back for a 1000 flexUSD. 


But wait if coinflex borrowes 450 USDC and 0.9 BCH and also has 450 USDC and 0.9 BCH can't they just swap internally?  


Okay but hold on. The yield on flexUSD comes from the interest that coinflex makes by borrowing OUT the USDC to their traders. So does that not mean that coinflex their OWN colletoral on maintaining these short and long positions is borrowed out to traders that want to trade with leverage? 

And there was whale with a huge BCH leveraged long, so does that not mean that this whale borrowed tons and tons of that USDC at least internally? 

So ... for coinflex to close their own short and long positions that back flexUSD they first have to get the collateral for these positions back that they borrowed to a whale with a huge leveraged bch long.  

Okay so what happens when you deposit BCH as collateral on coinflex and then loan against it and WITHDREW the USDC.

Well at the moment that the value of this withdrew USDC is the same as the BCH colletoral it should be sold on the market for USDC so that there are no losses.


And this is what has not happened. Coinflex for some reason had to dump a lot of BCH on the market and they did not. And now the value of this BCH is under the value of the withrew USDC. 

That 90 million dollars worth of BCH/USD perpetual future liquidity at 115 USD per BCH is 782,608 BCH which kind of matches up with the BCH that was send to Binance recently. 


On may 25 the BCH on Binance their hot  wallet was 2000 BCH.

Then between may 25 and June second the balance went from 2000 to 73000 BCH.

https://bitinfocharts.com/bitcoin%20cash/address/19dQkvaH2NGgkGomzZu3qrnqRGCicXwedM


But then lost of people have been buying BCH on Binance, sending it to hop.cash to sell for flexusd at 5 to 11% higher price.... then try to redeem the flexUSD for USDC, send the USDC to Binance and buy more BCH with it to go again.


Anyways it still looks like I am missing a lot here. What am I missing?

TLDR; Coinflex at one point most likely was forced to liquidate a bunch of BCH and other crypto that was used as collateral to get back UDSC so they could honor flexusd remptions but the low liquidity on the market makes it so there is a mismatch between them closing shorts and longs and the difference is the hole in coinflex solvency so they did not liquidate and now the market figured this out and is trying to take advantage and their hole is now even bigger, this would explain the mismatch between ask and bids on the big exchanges that trade BCH and why BCH is currently not going up and down with the rest of the market anymore but keeping in the 110 to 120 range.",49,btc,2022-06-24 05:32:06

vjynxg,thenextsymbol,26,https://redd.it/vjynxg,‚å® Discussion,"recent suspicious chain of events involving CoinFlex, BCH, and FlexUSD. did $90M worth of BCH go missing?","There's been a fair amount of chatter scattered across a couple of threads now about what looks... kind of suspicious to me at this point.

**basically it seems like the BCH that should be backing FlexUSD may no longer be there and someone went and tried to sell it on Binance.** this unsurprisingly caught the eye of folks in r/btc.

**if this $90M BCH is indeed missing, FlexUSD is totally worthless.**

i first stumbled into this yesterday when i was poking around reddit trying to figure out why FlexUSD was de-pegging so hard all of a sudden.  i came across [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/vizg41/on_multiple_exchanges_we_see_1020k_of_bch_bids_in/) about the mysterious appearance of a bunch of out of the money buy side orders appearing on all the exchanges at the same time by /u/big--if--true.

**important note:** reading the threads that touch on this subject it seems clear that some people have unknowingly conflated two separate piles of BCH that CoinFlex is supposed to maintain custody of:

1. **BCH locked up for smartBCH**. the BCH locked into the smartBCH is indeed still visible on chain. SAFU, as they say.
2. **BCH used to maintain the FlexUSD peg.** this pile of \~$90M of BCH that lived in a perpetual BCH/USDC on CoinFlex doesn't seem to be around any more... and Flex USD is suffering.

the conflation has lead to some complacency, because the smartBCH capital is clearly in the wallet where it's supposed to be.  it's just the FlexUSD chunk that seems to be missing.

# THE CHAIN OF EVENTS

as has already been noted in other threads, the fact that all these events happened in sequence is... concerning.

1. [A marketing blitz from CoinFlex promising impossible returns](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/vjql78/4_days_before_insolvency_and_freezing_all/). Seems like it might have been a cash grab, given what came next.
2. [Coinflex halting all withdrawals](https://np.reddit.com/r/Buttcoin/comments/vjjp22/why_coinflexs_halting_of_withdrawals_suggests_far/) yesterday morning
3. Ensuing [rapid de-pegging of FlexUSD](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/flex-usd), CoinFlex's ""stablecoin"" (hint: it's not stable) yesterday afternoon EST, followed by CoinFlex either killing the market or killing the blockchain to stop the price of FlexUSD from falling any further.  (not 100% clear yet on which market intervention happened, but they both have the same effect)
4. [The sudden appearance in the Binance hot wallet of a pile of BCH](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/vizg41/on_multiple_exchanges_we_see_1020k_of_bch_bids_in/idj1nxy/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) that was being sold out of the Binance hot wallaet, slowly but persistently.
5. /u/i_have_chosen_a_name then [pointed out](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/vizg41/on_multiple_exchanges_we_see_1020k_of_bch_bids_in/idj1tx2/) in this sub how fishy it was that the amount of BCH being sold from the Binance hot wallet almost exactly matched how much seemed to have been removed from CoinFlex's perpetual BCH/USDC ... future, or something ... that kept FlexUSD pegged.
6. at the same time there appeared a huge amount of [out of the money buy orders](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/vizg41/on_multiple_exchanges_we_see_1020k_of_bch_bids_in/) for BCH unlike the members of this sub had seen along with a bunch of wash trading of BCH, all of which would have contributed to obscuring the Binance BCH sale that /u/saylor_moon noticed. (see /u/rashaniquah's linked comment below; he did a seriously deep dive on this)
7. The sudden [reappearance of Mr. CoinFlex himself](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/vizg41/on_multiple_exchanges_we_see_1020k_of_bch_bids_in/idka39o/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), Mark Lamb (CEO, CoinFlex), **in this subreddit** doing what looked like diversionary commenting. Or something.  All I know is, whatever he was doing, it didn't look like what he *should* have been doing given that his company just imploded and he had just told all his customers they can't have their money back (for now, but probably ever again). He jumped in r/btc to ponder some stuff about the extra buy side orders being unrelated to the implosion of his company - which i personally would find totally plausible, FWIW - and complete ignored the fact that what people *really* were talking about was the fact $90M worth of BCH had somehow teleported from the FlexUSD backing to the Binance hot wallet and started selling itself.
8. Somewhere after theses posts got started here in r/btc the BCH stopped being sold on Binance. most of it (i want to say 400K BCH? but i can't find the comment) was transferred out of the Binance hot wallet.  that information is somewhere here in r/btc but i failed to dig it up.  it's almost as if someone was monitoring reddit and realized they'd been made by the fine redditors of this sub who seem to cherish and protect the larger BCH market, at which point they retreated from the sale.
9. /u/rashaniquah running some numbers and [finding $18M funneled out of CoinFlex](https://np.reddit.com/r/Buttcoin/comments/vjjp22/why_coinflexs_halting_of_withdrawals_suggests_far/idlmai1/?context=3), which he generously attributed to ""shitty accounting""?
10. FlexUSD, CoinFlex's ""stablecoin"" (second hint: it's not stable) mysteriously vanished from CoinMarketCap at some point. *poof*. note that CoinMarketCap is controlled by Binance, the same market that was being used to liquidate the BCH.
11. rumours i've heard on other social media channels that Mr. CoinFlex is suppressing discussion of the BCH that backs FlexUSD in [CoinFlex's telegram channel](https://t.me/coinflex_EN)... suppressing it or trying to divert it back to discussion of the BCH that is provably locked up in smartBCH contracts. i personally have seen him just ignoring all the hard questions his customers are asking him about their money and promise a statement ""soon.""  #FeelsLikeCelsius

there might be more to the story scattered around social media that i haven't seen; feel free to fill in blanks.  **and also** r/btc **seems to be pretty good at that ""on chain"" style of research.** if anyone has those skills and the time to jump in..

vk71h5,jessquit,16,https://redd.it/vk71h5,‚ö†Ô∏è Alert ‚ö†Ô∏è,Please stop using centralized bridges to smartBCH for any amounts of money that you are not willing to lose entirely,"I've stayed entirely out of the topic of smartBCH other than to say that I agree 100% with the decision to sequester complex smart contract functionality into a sidechain instead of building that complexity into the ""cash payment"" chain.

That said, a message needs to be broadcast that hasn't gotten through.

The purpose of the original centralized bridge (Coinflex) between BCH and smartBCH was intended to help foster development by allowing the rest of the smartBCH infrastructure to boot up while the decentralized bridge was being finished. The decentralized bridge (supposedly) required some simple changes to the base layer, which were made live about a month ago. We're still waiting to see if the decentralized bridge completes.

Now that Coinflex seems at risk, new centralized bridges are stepping in to fill the gap. The centralized bridge(s) should be considered ""live beta"" functionality intended to allow you to move a **small amount** of money into the smartBCH ecosystem so that developers can test the functionality of the things they are building, so that products can be demonstrated to investors, and so that early adopters can try out products before full scale launch.

As long as smartBCH is dependent on a centralized bridge in order to move funds to it, then those funds are **always at risk of being lost or stolen by the centralized bridge provider.** Until a decentralized bridge is available, smartBCH must be considered PRE-RELEASE software. If anyone is describing it differently, THEN THEY ARE LYING.

If a decentralized bridge cannot be developed or for whatever reason is never brought to fruition, then in my opinion smartBCH will have to be considered a dead project and relegated into the dustbin of great ideas that didn't pan out, or simply relaunched as its own coin.

I hope that isn't what happens. smartBCH is a truly interesting platform that might be capable of bringing great things to the BCH ecosystem. I encourage everyone interested in advanced smart contract functionality to try it out **USING NO MORE FUNDS THAN YOU ARE WILLING TO LOSE ENTIRELY** until the release of a decentralized bridge that can protect you from losses.

Unfortunately due to impatience and greed there are people out there launching products on smartBCH as though the system is ready for full scale use. Some of these people and organizations might even be perfectly well intentioned but until there is a decentralized bridge that can protect users from losses these organizations are behaving irresponsibly if they encourage anyone to invest more than they are willing to literally set on fire for entertainment value.

This is probably the only thing I will say about the smartBCH product. I personally came to Bitcoin for the main show, namely Peer-to-peer Electronic Cash, and that will remain my focus. I'm glad that smart architects realized the need to keep risky and complex smart contract functionality off the main payment layer. It is the correct architectural decision and, if a decentralized bridge can be finalized, I have high hopes for smartBCH. It is strong technology otherwise.

**Until then it needs to be treated like a live beta product.**

For any questions about smartBCH, the decentralized bridge, or any dApps, I'll defer to others who know more about it than I do.",56,btc,2022-06-25 04:41:08

This is actually strange and signals that the market movers are scared a large whale could enter the market and buy up enough BCH that their shorts may get squeezed, so they are buying up all the sells and all margin call sells, to take some of their short risk off the table.

* The only way to beat them is to buy BCH at the bottom while they themselves are waiting for sells to close their shorts. It costs them money to keep the price low so they are essentially subsidizing the BCH market price.

* There is a Bitcoin ETF decision to be made by the SEC on July 6, by a company who have stated that if approved will immediately create a BCH ETF, which could cause extreme buy pressure on these shorters. So as we say the 2 weeks are critical.",21,btc,2022-06-26 16:58:56
vlae3u,Dimass92,3,https://redd.it/vlae3u,None,BTC/ altcoin investment,"Hi lads,
First let  me tell my story and then ask an important question.
First time I had entered into crypto I put 500eur in far September 2017.... I had hold it during the winter crash of that year until mid-ends 2021, got a bit more than 3k that time as I got luck of putting it out just when it started dropping. Just to mention that the only investments that worked were btc and ethereum.
Then I made some other investments for really long periods in altcoins (-60%now) and I am not worried about these as the investment was pretty small. Basically 20-50eur in each alt coin.

Here is the question, this year market seems like someone tries go pull down the price before huge economic crisis, here is my question: am I the only one that that this feeling?
I am thinking to put some real money for poor European country (5-10k) in ‚Äúsafe‚Äù coins, do you think now is a good idea?",0,btc,2022-06-26 17:56:02

Soo... who pays who?

Initially thought RogerV invested $30M into CoinFLEX (they were pretty much a no name prior). Now I'm thinking CoinFLEX paid or promised to pay RogerV $30M to ""access"" [Bitcoin.com](https://Bitcoin.com) userbase. Hence RogerV's tweet that CoinFLEX owe him alot of money.

What about the individual negative -$47M position on the Exchange?  RogerV doesn't come across as someone that would be ""day trading"" let alone day trading on CoinFLEX. The ""individual agreement"" between him and CoinFLEX is likely that he deposit BCH to provide CoinFLEX with BCH liquidity (they are the biggest BCH<->sBCH bridge) and in return he gets ""loaned"" whatever the USDC **value  of BCH at the time + he has to pay interest.**

If market goes up or stays the same. Everyone wins. CoinFLEX gets the loan interest and RogerV gets to deploy that loan capital somewhere else.

Looks to me like RogerV also catered for market going down, hence the ""you can't liquidated the BCH position"" clause as this could further cause downward spiral pressure. Things would still be Rosy if RogerV continues to post more collateral.

So why would RogerV stop posting collateral? **Depends on the collateral.**  Not uncommon for whales to be Crypto rich but USD poor (ie illiquid assets). So why wouldn't Roger post more Crypto collateral? Maybe there's writing on the wall. Maybe CoinFLEX business is not sustainable. Maybe CoinFLEX is getting chicken feet and in attempt to recover cost is secretly selling BCH on binance causing price to go down further.  Meaning, the more collateral RogerV post the MORE he'll LOSE. Especially if you are a long term investor.

This is one possible scenario where both RogerV and MarkL tweets are both true.

At the end of the day, who's right or wrong all depends on the individual agreement contract between RogerV and CoinFLEX.

Anyways, I welcome this period of uncertainty. Its brings price lower and allows me to restash by BCH.  Lost half of my BCH stash playing with perpetuals on FTX. Luckily didn't post the other half of my BCH as collateral otherwise would have lost everything. LOL.

I guess I am not surprised, but it was an over-spewing of what seemed like government propaganda.

I provided my arguments to their responses and would have valued a formal discussion, but most arguments in return were Ad Hominem attacks. This is more or less what I expected, but wish internet people would be more open to discussion.

* It is not regulated (This is a good thing, money should not be backed by anything other than universal acceptance. Money should go where the people want their money to go, not where the government wants to spend money)
* It is not backed by anything (Correct, same as Gold, seashells, circular rocks, and any other currency used in the past before currencies have recently been tied to governments. The idea is that it will be backed by the people because they believe in Bitcoin's scarcity, portability, security, durability, divisibility, and acceptability. We are a long way from this of course, purely all speculation at this point)
* It is a Ponzi scheme, the only way to make money is to trade with the other speculators and scammers (NFTs and shitcoins fall under this category IMO. However, Bitcoin only has 2 possible final destinations, one being universal acceptability, and that is why it is possibly an *investment*. Investments are not Ponzis. You are investing in the technology of the future, in hopes that others do the same, *speculation*)
* It uses too much energy (No more than washing your clothes. It is 1,000,000 times more efficient than when it was conceived in 2009, and is worth the energy consumption)
* It is too slow (Layers such as Lighting are adding tremendous speed and allowing for future progress as a near-instantaneous transaction)
* Insufficiently divisible (The satoshi can be divisible by a million, it is written in the source code)
* It's not a currency (100% correct. It is in the infant stages of emerging as a currency, as all currencies have gone through this process. Purely based on speculation that one day it can emerge as the universal currency)

I am not going to speak here though and say Bitcoin is 100% going to succeed, or the answer to the world's problems, but there is no denying that Bitcoin is the most advanced form of money the world has ever seen and that is why it is not a scam. Plain and simple.

These folks however would rather be little government pawns instead of responding logically to my arguments. Instead of attacking the idea, they choose to make illogical comparisons and believe everyone investing in the idea is attempting to make a quick dollar.

vobh5k,EnisEnimon,19,https://redd.it/vobh5k,None,Why I have no sympathy for anyone getting rekt on the crypto markets,"2017 brought a very inconvenient change in the crypto market. USDT (unbacked fiat IOU) has been adopted on all major fiat-crypto gateways, completely hijacking price discovery. Ever since that year most of the price action was completely fake with the sole intention to pump prices to lure in speculators with real fiat and dumping on them, essentially it became a money extortion racket.

In parallel, mainstream media started to cover crypto more and more, but exclusively focused on price movements and predictions, not the fundamental, and only important value proposition: enabling finance without middlemen.

It was tragic to see that the movement stopped making waves due to usefulness (wikileaks/darknets/overcoming banking blockades and similar events) and if you were around as long as me you probably also noticed that all major crypto forums became unbearable (/r/btc is a rare exception) due to the only topics being the fiat price and cringe memes about market sentiment.

Sadly, we cannot blame some sinister entity like tether or blockstream. We can't say that the bagholders were deceived or manipulated. They are the victims of their own greed and stupidity and deserve what they got and will continue to face. These are the same people who truly believe that they can get rich trading stocks and CFDs and in the end mostly lose all their ""investment"".

I've been advocating for crypto use and adoption for more than 10 years now and out of several hundreds of people whom I introduced to this revolutionary technology about 2 of them started actually using it. the rest were only interested in ways to generate fiat from mining, price speculation, seeking out dodgy yield schemes. Obviously, if these people saturate the market, it shouldn't surprise anyone to see the whole thing collapse, it's a huge negative feedback loop and the opposite of sustainability, no matter how many shills on youtube and twitter predict and promise price appreciation.

Back then we always dreamed of ""mainstream adoption"", but in retrospect we were quite wrong, this is the mainstream guys and it is mentally broken and the next wave will be even worse, unless fiat currencies like USD/EUR start to fold.

Personally, I still keep supporting peer to peer money and continue to build stuff, but I scaled back on trying to get normies on board. They'll never see the light before the obsolete fiat systems crumbles in my view.",33,btc,2022-06-30 15:44:31

vpv09f,CarWrrel,3,https://redd.it/vpv09f,None,Reasons bitcoin had its worst quarter in more than a decade,"
The world`s largest cryptocurrency lost about 58% of value in the second quarter of 2022 with other promising cryptos like Concordium, Axie Inifinity and the likes also being affected.  Here are some flashpoints that hit the cryptocurrency industry last quarter. 
 
The stock sell-off has weighed on bitcoin and the crypto market as investors dump risky assets.  The first major episode last quarter was the collapse of the algorithmic stablecoin terraUSD and sister token luna which sent shockwaves through the industry. 
 
A stablecoin is a type of cryptocurrency usually pegged to a real-world asset.  The episode reverberated through the industry and had knock-on effects, most notably on cryptocurrency hedge funds Three Arrows Capital, which had exposure to terraUSD (more on this below. ) Crypto lender Celsius paused withdrawals for customers in June.  The company offered users yields of more than 18% if they deposit cryptocurrency with Celsius. 
 It then lent that money to players in the crypto market who were willing to pay a high interest rate to borrow the money.  Celsius cited ""extreme market conditions"" as the reason for pausing withdrawals.  The issues with Celsius exposed the weakness in many of the lending models used in the cryptocurrency industry that offered users high yields.  Three Arrows Capital is one of the most prominent hedge funds focused on cryptocurrency investments. 
 3AC had exposure to the collapsed algorithmic stablecoin terraUSD and sister token luna.  The Financial Times reported last month that U. S. -based crypto lenders BlockFi and Genesis liquidated some of 3AC's positions, citing people familiar with the matter. 
 
Cryptocurrency exchange CoinFlex halted customer withdrawals last month, citing ""extreme market conditions"" and a customers account that went into negative equity.  CoinFlex claimed that the customer, whom it alleges is high-profile crypto investor Roger Ver, owes the company $47 million.  Ver, who has the nickname ""Bitcoin Jesus"" for his evangelical views of the industry in its early days, denies that he owes CoinFlex money.  CoinFlex issued a new token called Recovery Value USD, or rvUSD, to raise the $47 million so it can resume withdrawals, and is offering a 20% interest rate for investors willing to buy and hold the digital coin. CoinFlex is also looking to recoup the funds from Ver.",7,btc,2022-07-02 16:06:19

vpx11i,thethrowaccount21,4,https://redd.it/vpx11i,‚ö†Ô∏è Alert ‚ö†Ô∏è,Post alleging that Kain_niak engaged in abusive behavior,"Ever since Kain changed his username (it used to be Kain_niak), he also started shilling for monero, which is also a scam. It seems like the monero community bought a lot of r/btc members out because this subreddit was very against monero and they wanted to bribe them to be pro-monero. Kain himself once called monero ""scary shit"", so it makes sense he'd be one of the people they'd bribe.

If you're not aware, monero is full of scams, people getting their wallets emptied, 'web services' that just take your money, etc. Monero itself had a huge 'premine' where a couple people got the vast majority of the early supply for months on end (Vitalik made a post saying he was getting a huge portion of the supply for six months with his self-updated miner) while regular people had an inefficient miner. Fluffypony is facing extradition for scamming 100k out of his former employer using an invoice scam, george donnelly also scammed the BCH (and Dash) community out of 60k USD. 

So it seems that this is how cryptocurrencies are attacked. Not with armies and guns, but with censorship, coercion and flooding the market with corruption and scams. The end goal seems to be to make you feel like 'fiat is safer' while destroying cryptocurrencies. Sorry for your loss.

My reply to the user below has been removed due to a bitcointalk link so I'm copying it here:

>What the fuck? Monero was not premined, and Monero doesnt have DEFI so there arent scams like this that exist

See how there's always people watching and waiting for a 'bad word about monero'? That's how you know they're shills and scamming others. 

Monero was effectively premined because the developers released a shitty miner for everyone else while keeping an optimized miner for themselves, which allowed them to get the majority of the supply during the early launch days. monero also has a very high emission curve, which means that the early days were heavily front-loaded.

Here is monero core developer 'smooth' **admitting that one guy got 60% of the supply for 2-3 months**, which is basically a full on premine.

vpyuxp,Darken-kun,44,https://redd.it/vpyuxp,‚å® Discussion,Bitcoin maximalism is a disease.,"I'm tired of seeing people claiming that BTC is the only true cryptocurrency of the world, and that everything else is just a scam. Ignoring the fact that there are thousands of serious projects on the market that actually do things that bitcoin will never be able to, since they're so resistent to improvements in their own coin. So they're proposing those crypto shouldn't exist, even though bitcoin cannot replace what they're capable of doing?!

They claim that every crypto was created just to enrich its developers, ignoring the fact that Satoshi Nakamoto himself have mined over 1 million BTC alone. He have created the rules of 50 BTC reward per block and its halving and knew the fact that him and the early adopters would have the opportunity to enrich themselves way before bitcoin getting mainstream.

They claim that the fact that bitcoin has never fallen from the first position on market cap proves that it's the best coin, ignoring that 99% of them don't use it as a currency, but to espectulate at its price fluctuation as if they were stocks. We still don't see bitcoin being used by Google, Amazon or Ebay to buy goods and services. It's still resctricted to a small niche of online sellers, over 10 years have passed and nothing has improved.

I don't think there's a perfect crypto in the world right now. And that's exactly why we need as much competition as possible. Bitcoin is slow, has high fees and it's complicated to use for an average person. I mean, wallets are still relying on scanning QR codes in 2022? For real? Couldn't they have already developed a simpler way to make payments, like a native bitcoin credit card that's complatible with the average card machine on the market? Do they really expect that bitcoin will gain mass adoption as a payment system acting like that?!

Anyway, that's my opinion, let me know what you have to say about it, even if you completely disagree with me. I'd love to hear your arguments to have a healthy discussion about this subject.",30,btc,2022-07-02 19:11:37
vqfodc,TheAlbeOne,37,https://redd.it/vqfodc,‚öôÔ∏è Technology,Why Bitcoin should have MimbleWimble,"Satoshi originally designed Bitcoin to be ""anonymous"".

Bitcoin's privacy issues started from the genesis block. Satoshi didn't think of privacy from the underlying protocol, but only focused on anonymity in transactions.

Has same privacy as cash.

Nobody can see what you receive or send.

Bitcoin is pseudonymous.

Transactions are linked forever.

Every Bitcoin address is visible to everybody forever, which is linked to every transaction.

It is trivial to link real-world identities to Bitcoin addresses.

Bitcoin's privacy issue's :

A Bitcoin address and transactions can be linked to real-world identities.

Addresses can be blacklisted.

Addresses can be used to build social graphs.

Transactions can be censored.

Bitcoin addresses, once linked to real-world identities, can be blacklisted by exchanges, e-commerce sites and other Bitcoin service providers.

MimbleWimble solves this by adding a privacy layer, where only non-valuable data will be on the blockchain. Only the sender and the receiver can see the cryptographic commitment. Therefore, only they can know how much money was really sent to each other. Furthermore, the transactions are ""unlinkable"". The sender and receiver are the only ones who know the amounts involved. The amounts are never publicly visible. This not only prevents transactions from being censored, but also from being linked to each other. If you send coins from A to B, and then from B to C, the change from B to C will not be traceable to A. The change is ""blind"" and ""indistinct"". The blockchain does not explicitly state what change happened. Only A and B know. C will never know. The blockchain does not say ""A sent X bitcoins to B"". It only says ""A has sent Z bitcoins that have not been spent yet"". The details of where, when and why are private. Even C cannot tell if A sends money to B or C. The details are ""blind"" and ""indistinct"". This is something that cannot be done with other cryptocurrencies. No other cryptocurrency provides true privacy and fungibility.

BTC does not provide absolute ""privacy"". It is superior to all other cryptos in almost all respects, except for ""fungibility"". It has the same problem as all other cryptos. If BTC is tainted, then all BTC will be tainted. Monero(XMR) does not have this problem. If I send you some dirty dollars, then only my dollars will be dirty. You could still use them as normal dollar bills. None of the other people will know that they are dirty. The same is not true for cryptocurrencies. If a coin is ""tainted"", then the entire coin is ""tainted"". If I believe that a currency is ""dirty"", then I cannot use it. This ""blacklisting"" problem does not exist with Mimblewimble. If I send you some ""dirty"" coins, then only my coins will be ""dirty"". If nobody else knows, then they will not know that my ""dirty"" coins are ""dirty"". They could still use my ""clean"" coins as ""clean"". Only you will know.

The ""cleaning"" is ""indistinct"" and ""blind"". This ""indistinguishability"" of ""clean"" and ""dirty"" is very powerful. It solves the ""blacklisting"" problem of other crypto-currencies. It makes it impossible to blacklist ""good"" and ""bad"" people. It allows people to transact without fear. It allows them to ""hide"" from powerful people and organizations. It protects their freedom. This ""indistinguishability"" of ""clean"" and ""dirty"" is also very useful. It makes it almost impossible to determine what the ""true"" value of a ""coin"" is. This ""indistinguishability"" of ""clean"" and ""dirty"" means that a ""coin"" is ""not worth"" as much as a clean one, even if it is ""worth"" more. Basically, a ""coin"" is ""not worth"" anything. Hence, the ""value"" of a ""coin"" is completely ""indistinct"". This ""indistinguishability"" of ""clean"" and ""dirty"" also has many other uses. It will solve many scaling and privacy problems in the future. The ""indistinguishability"" of ""clean"" and ""dirty"" is one of the main advantages of ""MimbleWimble"". The ""indistinguishability"" of ""clean"" and ""dirty"" makes ""MimbleWimble"" a ""perfect"", ""pure"" and ""fair"" monetary system.

The ""indistinguishability"" of ""clean"" and ""dirty"" is ""money"". The ""indistinguishability"" of ""clean"" and ""dirty"" is ""freedom"". It protects the ""innocent"" as well as the ""guilty"". It allows the ""poor"" to ""trade"" with the ""rich"". It lets the ""weak"" to ""fight"" against the ""strong"". It prevents the ""government"" from ""taxing"" the ""people"". It prohibits the ""banks"" from ""taking away"" your money. It forces the ""corporations"" to ""give"" you the ""profits"" that they make. It stops the ""trader"" from ""cheating"" the ""customer"". It ensures that the ""worst"" ""offender"" does not ""harm"" the ""best"" ""offender"". It guarantees that ""all"" are ""treated equally"".",0,btc,2022-07-03 11:37:24

While it is a network in the sense that it facilitates peer-to-peer commission, it is not a parallel network or one that has its own native cryptocurrency or token, nor its blockchain or decentralized record of transactions. 

Many people come to think that what is used in Lightning are virtual bitcoins, or pretend bitcoins, when nothing could be further from the truth. Lightning is Bitcoin. For these reasons Lightning drives bitcoin transactions used as a payment method, usually in online stores like Exeno (which is one of the most important so to speak).

In short, they argued that Lightning channels are made up of 2 users, who create a Bitcoin transaction by joining their signatures (multi-signature) to establish how many satoshis (fractions of BTC) can be sent or received in that channel, so there is no way Bitcoin and Lightning are different things.",0,btc,2022-07-03 17:03:19

vr0i9a,AngelLeatherist,30,https://redd.it/vr0i9a,‚å® Discussion,I watched the 2 hr long video featuring Roger Ver's statement on Coinflex so you dont have to (Plus some premature opinions ive formed on the matter),"Ths first like hour and twenty minutes or so was all talk of BCH adoption and its usecases. Honestly a bit refreshing as someone who comes from Monero, to see an ally viewpoint articulated in a way that resonates. 

Finally Roger is asked to give his statement on Coinflex. And he basically says, and i paraphrase: ""I signed a nondisclosure agreement with mark/coinflex which i both wish to honor and my lawyers have advised me to say nothing yet."" He also answered a question later, verifying he owns equity in Coinflex. If you went looking for a big statement, sorry, it was small.

After that it was just speculation, the people on the show talking about ""if this, if that"", and asking interesting legal questions about whether coinflex has broke the law, the ramifications of suing, and whether theyve been honest or shady.

Now, on to my opinion so far:

First of all I commend Roger Ver for making the stance in the video to stand for truth, not just take his side. And I recognize the first line of fault belongs to Mark for general mismanagement and seeming to say one thing then do another. With that said, theres an element in me thats causing me to tend more towards Mark's side.

Heres what we know: Roger signed a nondisclosure agreement with Coinflex. Why? Based on what Coinflex has said, he was playing with leverage. Roger does not deny this, although to be fair maybe he can't. So it sounds like he borrowed money to (probably) long BCH, then that backfired with the market downturn.

If this is all true, then why doesnt Roger Ver owe money? It seems like theres a disagreement over small specifics, like Roger is ""throwing the book"" at Mark, being possibly what id call a ""contract nazi"". Roger may be saying ""technically, because x, y, and z, legally i dont have to pay you back the money i borrowed"". Its suspicious to me that Mark got personal, but Roger immediately quieted and lawyered up hard.

Lets entertain a thought. Put your sympathy hats on. Imagine being Mark, putting your full trust and faith in your friend, mentor, and hero (Roger Ver), you let him borrow a ton of your money because you trust and love him,  you dont worry too much about contract specifics because you have full faith in his fairness and integrity, then when you need him most he pulls the rug out from under you, refuses to give you your money back, then goes to The State to sue and attack you for the rest of what you have. Tons of likely crimes have been commited due to naivety, and things are getting real dark for Mark.

Now imagine being Roger. Rich. He decides to borrow money and play with leverage. Why, hes already rich?... And then after being on a best friend basis, he just defaults on his obligation over some technicality. Then hires statists to fight Mark in court. And does all this knowing it rugs the smartbch community. Roger could even fix that out of pocket, could he not?

Okay now lets talk resolution... Mark has the smartbch money, but is holding onto it. Why? Its obvious hes scared, spooked. Maybe he wouldnt be if Roger wasnt going after him. From what we know it sounds like Marks story is at least mostly true. Roger could make a deal with Mark, appease and comfort him, then hed be able to release the funds. Instead Roger has gone legal and Mark went degen sh*tcoining. Both parties are going nuclear for no reason.

In short, thanks for listening to my contrarian, speculative opinion. And i like Roger, his spirit resonates with me. But Roger: Why were you playing with an insane amount of leverage, and why are you employing the State to enforce your claims? This isnt purely defensive, this is equally offensive.

And one final remark, all the people raising pitchforks to each other based on now shut down smartbch apps... Stop. Collateralized assets on smartbch need to be redeemed on smartbch. Stop threatening people like Kain who is stuck unable to redeem his stablecoin with people. How do you expect people to manage this? If they refund everybody (assuming they have the funds) both you need to prove you are you, and they need to prove they refunded you, and it doesnt end there! What if they refund a bunch of people, smartbch goes back up, the tokens get fraudulently exchanged/sold, now theres more people demanding redemptions then coins that exist? Plus its kinda hard to manually process hundreds/thousands of redemptions. This situation hurts everyone, and you cant immediately shift blame to other victims. 

All that being said, i could be very wrong about the intentions of everyone i made a contrarian stance to defend, but ive just got this nasty feeling about this whole situation, like something is just not right. It feels like this situation is probably not what it seems. I dont think its Hero Roger and Villain Mark. Not the other way around either, probably angry Roger and destitute Mark.

I encourage you to be a contrarian too. 

I dont know whats going on with Roger but this isnt his first rodeo with either insolvent partners, bad actors, claims of being scammed, or going to lawyers to fight something on fine print. Roger are you feeling okay? Are you hurting inside? Theres no need to bottle up bad emotion if thats what this is. You are a self claimed anarchist, but i feel like youve been acting less than anarchistly lately.",16,btc,2022-07-04 05:56:01

vrp65c,HermanSchoenfeld,120,https://redd.it/vrp65c,None,Why BCH Won't Succeed,"Hi Guys,

This message is for the good intentioned people in this eco-system.

I've been here since the beginning and I've been in Bitcoin since 2011. Many of you remember me from my failed flip-starter (thankfully destroyed by some petty members here). That's okay, I've failed at a lot of things in my life (in most things that I try in fact), but I have had the odd successes here and there. 

During the flip-starter failure, I had mentioned that BCH was headed out of top-10 and into top-50. This was around the time of the infrastructure reward proposal/split from ABC.  At the time, it seemed unthinkable to 99% of community here but today BCH is hanging on at #30, and dropping.

Today I'm here to predict BCH will drop to top-100, and then soon after sink to top-500.

As a retrospective co-founder of a crypto which was once in top-30 and now top-5000, I've seen this happen on a second-by-second, blow-by-blow basis.

I don't say this out of some hate of this project or pettiness. I say this to help those of good heart and who mean well but who are exasperated with how things are working out. The truth is that your reality model isn't congruent with empirical reality. As a market participant you make decisions based on your knowledge, but complete knowledge is unattainable and thus you are forced to act in ignorance. It is this fact that led you to delusional beliefs (even if well-intentioned) and now reality has caught up to you.

No amount of good intentions or wishful thinking will change this outcome. Hard work can affect it, but that's not enough. It needs to be an extraordinary amount of hard smart-work and you are competing with the worlds best geniuses in this endeavour. The odds aren't good.  

You need to start thinking through your position. What is the main value proposition for BCH? According to most, it is ""P2P Cash"". But what you aren't considering is that this is true for **all other cryptos** as well (even if they don't advertise it). Since the original 2017 hard-fork, BCH never attained leadership of this use-case and was always behind other other cryptos (like BTC, ETH and even LN). Today even those are fading as well as a cambrian explosion of other cryptos and new technologies emerge. 

The original proposition of BCH was ""original Bitcoin"". This did carry some weight but that was since given up on and adopted/squandered by ""BSV"". And it doesn't matter anyway because even ""BTC Bitcoin"" is fading and I predict will be toppled from #1 within 12 months (due to being deprecated legacy technology with an irrational value proposition as well).

So where is the value proposition in this industry? As someone deeply involved in the development of this technology, I can tell you the layer-1 wars (now layer-0) will **never** end. There is now consensus technology being developed by Web3 Foundation as part of Polkadot's eco-system that is even beyond ""layer-0"" (and they too will one day be deprecated).

The technology bar now is so far beyond BCH's gen-1 UTXO blockchain that the question is for how long will you continue to waste your time and energy on a foggy road that most assuredly ends in a dead-end?

DISCLAIMER: BCH may temporarily resurge if/when regulators classify ICO-founded coins as securities (which I'm reliably informed is on the cards). But this will only be a temporary reprieve much like how US Gov stifled motor vehicles to save fading Horse-n-Buggy industry.",7,btc,2022-07-05 04:05:19

Without even delving into anything overly technical, I think that question is still  the dumbest I've been asked so far about crypto.

I like to say that just the mere fact that cryptocurrencies facilitate cross-border transactions makes it superb. And this is besides all of the other wonderful projects that keep being launched on the blockchain. Imagine being able to earn bucks just by moving (move-to-earn) or the fact that you can mint your creatives into an NFT and get to sell on marketplaces such as Solis, OpenSea, mintable and many others.

Like I said, just the basic fact that I can get funds in the form of Bitcoin,  Eth or any other token sent directly from clients around the world makes crypto so useful to me. Some people may not see that as a biggie, but for any freelancer, crypto is damn useful even just as a means of payment.",5,btc,2022-07-05 19:29:21

vsk1eu,OkSeesaw3317,26,https://redd.it/vsk1eu,None,How many here have realized that crypto becoming money is not very realistic.,"Wake up, it's been more than a decade. Nobody in the ""real world"" wants to use crypto as money.

The biggest problem is not even the volatility (and I will talk about that), it's that it's a terrible medium of exchange because almost nobody is using it for real-world exchange. This is something so many here are forgetting, money is only valuable because it is widely accepted as a medium to trade with. It's the network effect that makes it ultimately useful.

The problem with ""cryptocurrencies"" is that not only do they lack this network effect (in the real economy, not in crypto casino land), but there is no real path for them to get there.

It's very similar to trying to compete with big social media companies like Facebook and Twitter. It's nearly impossible because any new social network startup would be mostly empty of users and there is no advantage for anyone new joining in. The first users are actually punished for being first.

The same is true for starting a new currency. First users must hold a currency that is not accepted anywhere. This is why crypto will never become money. You will never get enough people willing to give up real money for crapy ""cool tech"" money that reduces your buying options by 99%. All the tech geeks who want to hold crypto because it's ""shiny shiny"" have already bought it (truth is, it's mostly speculators). The rest just want money that works for paying bills and grocery shopping.

Without first users, there is no path for crypto to reach mainstream adoption. So many in crypto are so blindly ideological that they are incapable of seeing that what they are preaching is of no value to anyone. It doesn't solve any problems and actually creates more problems for those who use it.

I didn't even talk yet about volatility. It's bad enough if your money is not accepted anywhere, it's even worse if you don't know what its value is going to be tomorrow and it keeps jumping around. If you think about it, crypto is actually the worst money that could have ever been designed. It's so bad, that it's almost unethical to encourage anyone to use it.

Lastly, the biggest obstacle is the government. In the completely unrealistic, fantasy scenario where 100,000,000 people in the US are willing to make their lives harder by switching over to ""broken fancy tech money"" that bounces around in value, and is unreliable as payment, you would still need to pay taxes with the US dollar. This would be only one of many obstacles. The government will not outright ban crypto, thay will just keep introducing new forms of regulations that make ""crypto money"" harder to use. In the end, the government is in control here. Crypto is not a government escape ticket.

If by now, you find this all a little depressing, don't be. Crypto as money is still a great story! If you need to sell your crypto and need a new sucker to buy you out, this is a great story to tell him. Don't mention anything I said here. Tell the new sucker that it's going to be the ""*future of money*"" and show him pictures on social of small businesses with a bitcoin cash sticker, and say: ""*You see? Everyone is accepting it! It's going mainstream!*"". The new sucker will be very impressed and excited, and will happily buy your crypto allowing you to exit the pyramid ride and get something way better and more useful in return: **Fiat Currency.**

It's what we all want in the end, right?",0,btc,2022-07-06 07:19:01

Wallet of Satoshi or Chivo, aka banker's Bitcoin, not real Bitcoin. Fake Bitcoin and probably even fractional reserve Bitcoin. Because opening my channel will cost at least 0.001 BTC on liquidity plus, opening the channel and closing with routing fees on top.

I am sure one penny won't be enough to do all that.

**Until the disastrous bear market came, most of the time I don't really care about market cycles because it's a natural path, and you need to know how to handle because this is economics, and everyone should try to control their movements in both good and bad days. But this Bear Market got a different feel and it was a way deserving situation.**

**VC's and centralized institutions attempted to take a big part of investments in crypto, doing risky moves, and killing the essence of getting safe, private and not completely artficial money.**

**Right now different chains are full of controversy due to that, and IMHO SmartBCH took a bit of it, but it's only a small part here considering that we have weeks of controversy around Twitter and Reddit. SmartBCH already came with solutions proving that they care about providing solutions to people who are interested in DeFi products, and at the same time this helped a lot those DEXes who were in a skeptical situation regarding their future.**

**At this point, we have now in the ecosystem teams who are dedicating most of their days in releasing utility and use their funds to build actually decentralized products, And that's where people should look at.**

**BlockNG (big props for giving us a bridge where we can continue our work) Mistswap team which not only has probably the strongest DEX in the ecosystem, but contributes in the release of different stuff (LNS,** [**Sonar.Cash**](https://Sonar.Cash)**, sponsoring competitions, and first bridge in the sBCH ecosystem). We have aggregators from TangoSwap and BenSwap gives us a nice variety of tokens to engage in LP's.**

**And all of this was in a complicated time, just imagine when SHA-GATE comes out, bridges with ETH, DAO's and all of this comes with the most valuable P2P currency we have atm. Better than LN, and it brings the stability L2's needs regarding gas and traffic, forget about excessive reorgs, and launching a node rn it's a unique opportunity considering their price, a real L2 experience.

Back in 2018, specifically from September until the end of 2018, I used to see Roger Ver EVERYDAY on my feed and on YouTube talking about Bitcoin Cash. I used to see Bitcoin Cash posts EVERYWHERE. Twitter, Reddit, friends talking about it, YouTube, and news articles.

Now, 4 years later, (wow 4 years later? time goes too fast) I don't see any of that anymore. I don't see any Roger Ver videos on YouTube talking about BCH anymore. I don't see anywhere as many tweets and articles as I used to see. I don't see 1/1000 of the stuff I used to see about Bitcoin Cash on my feeds.

It feels like Roger Ver has completely given up on Bitcoin Cash.

I am a huge fan, and supporter of Roger Ver. I really am a HUGE fan of him. However, I don't feel like Roger Ver was transparent as to his BTC & BCH holdings.

Roger Ver claims he converted the majority of his BTC fortune to BCH, which is estimated to be at over 140,000 BTC. If he really did that, he would've lost over 900 million dollars due to BCH going down 30x from what it was in 2017.

To me, it looks like Roger Ver never really converted much of his BTC holdings to BCH. I'd take a wild guess and say Roger probably put a light 30-60 million into BCH, but nothing more. Surely not anywhere as much as he claims he has, which would've resulted in a devastating financial loss for him.

So Roger, I hope I don't come across as being too offensive (I'm a huge fan and admirer of you) but can you admit that you've given up on BCH ?",0,btc,2022-07-07 13:01:43

> [BCH came about due to precisely such centralized toxicity emanated by BTC.](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/vsrlcb/btc_is_a_revolution_if_youre_not_outraged_youre/if2w7kz/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf&context=3)



So I have been following bitcoin since 2013 and only started buying in last year.

One of the things that always amazed me was the blocksize wars from 2017. It was incredibly informative to see what happens to bitcoin as an opensource decentral democratic protocol.

It unfortunately took me a while to start taking bitcoin more seriously. One of the biggest issues I've always had with bitcoin is how hardforks caused bitcoin to split into multiple directions. So thats why Im starting this thread. I want to know the truth behind hard forks and I want to know if I should spread my holdings over to other hardforks of bitcoin.

The conversation ended with me writing the following comment:

> But... if that were to be true, then that means bitcoin is still the real bitcoin?

> I mean, the opinions here depend on wether bitcoin should be like how it was described in the original white paper versus how bitcoins function evolved from a decentralized form of money to a decentralized form of value.

> Money has 3 main functions, and bitcoin (similar to gold) sucks at 2 of them.

> 1.	‚Å†Medium of exchange: this is certainly better with BCH and BSV due to the lower fees, but it still sucks due to the second function.

> 2.	‚Å†Unit of account: this sucks for all three. In order for money to evolve into a good unit of account we need something with a stable price. Unfortunately we ditched the gold standard partly due to golds volatility. Its one of the main reasons why the USA decided to switch to a central bank monetairy system. Which brings me to the third function.

> 3.	‚Å†Store of value. This function is lacking for every other commodity or currency out there, besides gold and bitcoin. Afaik these are the only 2 that are good at maintaining and increasing their value over time. Maybe this is the reason why BTC didnt change their 1mb block size (I think). And, if you look at it rather rationally, you will notice that this function will only be fullfilled when the general sentiment of our population agrees on holding and not selling, despite the market downturn. Savehaven assets are like that because of human sentiment. I havent seen this happening with bsv or bch yet.

> If you don't change the protocol in a way that does damage to bitcoins official SEC status as a ""commodity"" similar to gold (said by gary gensler himself) then I dont really have a problem with the segwit integration. It seems like they just streamlined the protocol to scale before increasing blocksize. Afterall, the signature was only important for the smart contract function, but didnt taproot somehow try to implement this later?

> Excuse me for writing this long ass comment, but these are my thoughts right now. If you have any arguments against this then I would appreciate if you could list them

> Edit: that s2x deal, what was that about? Did the core developers break the rules? Was this issue related to miner centralization?",2,btc,2022-07-08 14:51:54

Can‚Äôt we make an algorithm where we pool our savings trustlessly and essentially the program regulates the Bitcoin Cash supply to maintain a certain price. This way we can offer stability to merchants and have a monetary policy where for example 1% of BCH in that savings account gets freed to balance the price, and that same BCH can also be taken away from the market (to regulate supply and demand) 

Eventually we choose our own monetary policy which will allow BCH to appreciate over time For example let‚Äôs say Bitcoin Cash is $1 Million, where 1 mBCH is $1. 5 years from there we can reintroduce coins into circulation and Bitcoin Cash price would be $1.1 Million because of the extra demand from consumers to buy those coins.

1. Everything verifiable on-chain should not be regulated however everything off-chain should be regulated
2. USDC and USDT are potentially the biggest threat to systemic risk for crypto
3. They are not verifiable on-chain, yes they publish and say most is in cash
4. But the crypto way to do it is to simply hash everything on-chain
5. Or expose their treasury end-points on-chain for you to verify instead and this eliminates the risk
6. If you cannot verify everything a crypto claims on-chain then its probably risky

that is even after the recent crash in all crypto assets. yet coinbase still has 2,782x more assets than Coinflex, yet Coinflex faked their volume to pretend they had even more activity than coinbase and other exchanges.

They are a fraudulent bucketshop and their numbers prove it. 92 million total assets for a crypto exchange is not much, yet they consistently faked their way to the top of trading volume leaderboards. 

It makes sense companies doing 24/7 fraudulent wash trading would either gamble away customer funds or just invent reasons to exit scam everyone including smartBCH owners who have nothing to do with their company. They have no users, no reputation, just a no name bucketshop.


Smart BCH is over 12% of their entire exchanges assets, so in short they are liquidating all smartBCH users' assets and giving them to their exchange users. Even though these assets have nothing to do with their exchange. Their exchange has 0 assets so they are clawing all smartBCH assets to give their users 10% of their supposed deposits, which no longer exist.

The growth of the NFT sector has been pretty much unimaginable, starting from zero to become a multi-billion dollar industry in such a short time. I'm however interested in knowing, besides Solis NFT marketplace, if there are other marketplaces where NFTs in .mp4 format can be traded?

This is pretty much a straightforward enquiry about NFTs and the most popular file formats that can be minted into NFTs. 

My findings however show that most marketplaces accept just files in either jpeg or png formats. If this is correct, then it seems that puts a limit on creators who produce audio content such as poetry, movies, music etc.",3,btc,2022-07-11 19:14:20
vwqfw7,YeOldDoc,44,https://redd.it/vwqfw7,üíµ Adoption,Flippening: Lightning Network is processing more payments than BCH.,"- LN:  28.068 payments per day [Source](https://arcane.no/research/reports/the-state-of-lightning-volume-2)
- BCH: 27.609 tx per day [Source (10th of July)](https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/bitcoin%20cash-transactions.html)

The usual disclaimer applies. Payments on the Lightning Network are private and encrypted. The estimates are based on statistics collected over several nodes in January and February 2022. The number of payments have roughly doubled between 2021 and 2022 (+100%), while the transacted USD value has increased by ~+400%.  

In addition, Kraken has enabled Lightning Network for its customers in April 2022 which will likely have increased payment count beyond the previous trend to around ~40K to ~50K per day in July 2022.",0,btc,2022-07-11 19:14:36
vwqpyf,Slanlcker,1,https://redd.it/vwqpyf,None,What kind of regulations do you expect from the Financial Stability Board?,"
While government regulation may end up not being the best for the crypto industry, I guess it would finally have to happen sometime not too far from now. In my opinion, there would be an implosion or self-destruct in the industry if some form of barricade in terms of regulations isn't introduced in a short while. You may ask why? First is the volume of 'unchecked' projects that make their way into the industry everyday. Besides the catastrophic Terra, there are tons of projects such as Chronoly which is involved in NFT watches; Toklok which is a blockchain based social media platform; and several others in move-to-earn and play-to-earn categories.

The incessant hacks, liquidations and the resultant loss of investor funds are issues that also calls for some supervisory oversight of the market. According to the FSB: ""The FSB is working to ensure that crypto-assets are subject to robust regulation and supervision. The recent ""turmoil"" in crypto markets highlights the intrinsic volatility and structural vulnerabilities as well as the increasing interconnectedness between crypto markets and the traditional financial system.""

But guess we'd have to await the recommendations of the Financial Stability Board come October to know what regulations would be put in place which would cover stablecoins and other digital assets.",0,btc,2022-07-11 19:26:15

The lesson here? Premature optimization is the root of all programming evils.,"Thanks to /u/yeolddoc for his informative post showing that the Lightning Network now processes 28,068 transactions per day.

28,068 typical 400 byte 2-in-2-out transactions per day would add an additional 11.22 MB to the blockchain per day; which comes out to an additional 78KB of space per block.

So: five years in, and what did we get for all the energy, attacks, reengineering of the platform, loss of BTC dominance, and splitting of the chain to force payments offchain?  What's the payoff?

**A grand total savings of 78KB per block.**

All of that effort and waste, just for this.

The term for things like LN is ""premature optimization"" -- the undertaking of a massive project and a complete rethinking of the platform, to achieve near-zero results, when the simple, straightforward, original plan would have clearly sufficed.

Either people who are backing LN are crazy, or I‚Äôm not understanding how it works. The more I hear about it, the more I realize it‚Äôs a copy and paste of the current financial system. Let me explain.

I store value in physical gold (call that BTC) in a physical safe (call that a cold wallet). Then I put the amount of value I want to spend in a bank account (call that a hot wallet).

I can then use the bank (LN channel) network to facilitate my gold transfer. But because physical gold is impractical to transfer (high fees on BTC), I convert the gold (BTC) to fiat currency (LN-BTC).

While using the bank (LN channel) if I don‚Äôt like the facilitation of transfer due to fees or regulations, I can move to a different bank (LN channel) that will move the fiat (LN-BTC) for me.

Meanwhile I can at anytime pull fiat (LN-BTC) out of my bank (LN channel) and turn it into gold (BTC) then put it in my physical safe (cold wallet)

**Can the large centralized liquidity hubs such as strike, chivo etc actually ‚Äúprint more IOUs for bitcoin‚Äù ? How exactly would that be done ?**

*Their answer: For any btc to be on the LN, the same amount must be locked up on the base layer so this is a lie.*

AFAIK strike is merely a fiat ramp where you pay using their bitcoin, so after you deposit USD they pay via their own bitcoin via lightning. I don‚Äôt see how strike can pay with fake IOUs through the LN. Chivo I‚Äôve heard has more L-btc than actual btc only because they may not even be using the LN in the first place. So it seems the only way they can do this is on their own bankend not actually part of the LN.

Many even say hubs have no ability to refuse transactions or even see what their destination is.

In the end due to the fees for opening a channel, the majority will go the custodial route without paying fees. But what are the actual implications of that. The more I read the more it seems hubs can‚Äôt do that much (can‚Äôt make fake ‚Äúl-btc‚Äù, or seek out to censor specific transactions, but can steal funds hence the need for watchtowers)

I think this research by u/Cr1N  into bitcoin being removed by Overstock deserved more visibility. The original report by u/H0BB5 at r/cc was censored which for a while made [our conversation here](/r/btc/comments/vxtnti/overstockcom_stops_accepting_bitcoin/)  inconclusive.

From r/btc/comments/vxtnti/overstockcom_stops_accepting_bitcoin/ig0magh/

""
Glad to see someone else noticed. Their support people have either been ignorant, insisting they do accept Bitcoin, or have simply acknowledged it's disabled but don't know why or whether it's permanent or temporary. Since Overstock has been a pioneer in terms of Crypto acceptance, I thought it was a little strange and did some digging.

Their source code still shows the ability to accept Bitcoin and other crypto is there, it's just been toggled off. Their checkout is initialized by some embedded JSON, which shows the various flags that are used to disable rendering of crypto/btc payment options.

https://i.imgur.com/zRHit17.png

You can also see their legacy checkout page by going to ""checkout?ostklgcy=true"" instead of the regular checkout page, which actually displays the crypto option but shows it as ""temporarily unavailable.""

https://i.imgur.com/VhJsRgW.png

So it doesn't seem they have removed the ability as much as they have disabled it. This would be somewhat inconclusive by itself, but a quick google search found an interview with their CEO Jonathan Johnson from *last week*. 

Here's what he had to say:

>JONATHAN JOHNSON: Yeah, we're still holding, or HODLing, our Bitcoin. One thing I monitor is the amount of Bitcoin that's spent on Overstock each week. It's always been less than a percent, a very small percent of our revenue. But during crypto winter, it's really dried up to where almost no one is spending Bitcoin or crypto to buy goods on Overstock. So I think people are-- traders will trade in and out. HODLers aren't spending like they were when Bitcoin was at a higher price.

>BRAD SMITH: If they stopped spending in Bitcoin, is that something that Overstock thinks about sunsetting at that point?

>JONATHAN JOHNSON: No, it's an easy program for us to keep. We like it. It keeps our toe in the water in this space. If it went to 0 for a long period of time, sure, we might turn it off. But I don't see that in the future. I think Bitcoin's taken a pause. And as you know, more than cryptocurrency, we're really bullish on blockchain technology. We have a portfolio of companies. We have a venture capital firm managing. We think tZERO, Bit, GrainChain. These blockchain technology companies have a bright, bright future.

The full interview is here: https://finance.yahoo.com/video/overstock-com-ceo-details-tough-141103848.html

My theory is they're probably doing some maintenance and this period of low BTC transaction volume is an ideal time in which to do it. I imagine it'll be back fairly soon.

Any notion that accepting BTC is prohibitive is generally FUD. Previously they have used Coinbase as their payment processor, who charge a flat 1% fee on all crypto settlements. Credit cards in comparison typically charge the merchant in the region of 3-4%. There's very little downside to continuing to accept Bitcoin.

Edit: **I was wrong.** I spoke again with their chat and they confirm it is permanent. https://i.imgur.com/ctoYMYE.png

If Bitcoin is to succeed, it won't be on a high racketeering fees structure and must be on cheap transactions. It must be with your private keys and not custodians. If the government goes after cash, they will go after cryptos, and any amount of cryptos held with custodians can be seized at any point. It is a possibility just waiting to happen.

Port forwarding is necessary for Bitcoin nodes to accept inbound connections, Fulcrum (Electron-Cash) servers, serving web-sites from PC & setting up a Tor relay. Unfortunately many of us like myself can't forward ports properly from fiber modem. Unlike VPN port forwarding, [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/free) is free to try! PureVPN otoh may involve a 24 month contract. Every Google account with a proper debit card # gets 3 months free with $300 credit. I've only used $22 in 9 days, including VM setup.

Ports 80 & 443 are for HTTP & HTTPS. Ports 8333‚Üí8335 are for [BCHD](https://bchd.cash/) (full node). Ports 50001‚Üí50004 are for Fulcrum, an EC server. Port 22 is for Windows OpenSSH Server. Seeding torrents may require yet another port.

The problem is that it's quite difficult for ppl to figure out how to forward ports reliably using ssh, even if it is free. The above command requires a few things:

1. ""tunnel"" refers to a working VM inside the cloud. `gcloud compute instances create` can be used from **PowerShell**, since the gcloud website is too confusing imo. There might be a firewall rule needed at gcloud's website, though.
2. `sudo apt-get install sshpass` is necessary, after `gcloud compute ssh tunnel` from PowerShell. **sshpass** allows combining everything into a single cmd command.
3. In Win10 go to Manage Optional Features & install **OpenSSH Server**. Optionally if you go to the Windows **Services** app you can check that OpenSSH Server is running properly.
4. Replace WindowsPassword & WindowsUsername with your Win10 login credentials. A more secure, more complicated, option is to create a **secondary** non-admin account for port forwarding (~~always logged in~~). Same sort of thing should also work for local Linux or macOS.

I recently [posted](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoincash/comments/vytl65/batch_script_to_automate_resetting_wifi_in_win10/) a batch script to auto reset failing Wi-Fi adapters. This can be combined a new batch script which reboots the gcloud tunnel & then resets the ssh port forwarding. Copy the following into notepad & save as *MaintainSSHConnection.bat*

    :GoTo

replacing the password & username with your own, & double-click to run. It takes btwn 10 & 15 secs to reboot the Linux VM (maybe 20 is safer). I'm not sure why `call` is necessary.

**Edit**: I originally had 2 scripts here which worked together, but now I've successfully tested *MaintainSSHConnection.bat* on its own, without Admin privileges  nor *MaintainInternetConnection.bat*. Also I've re-ordered the commands because it's more efficient to not always reboot first. If the SSH connection breaks, the script waits until it can reboot the gcloud VM, & then restarts after delay. It's easy to set up a secondary user account in Windows with strong password, & it'll work straight away without logging in, etc.

I'm running a Fulcrum server at [bchd.tk](https://bchd.tk), as well as a BCHD SLP-GraphSearch server. There's a timeout problem with the [bchd-mainnet.electroncash.de](https://bchd-mainnet.electroncash.de) server, so EC-SLP users might need an alternative! Using free gcloud port forwarding anyone can run their own graphsearch server, etc. gcloud could be like gmail for VPN! A Tor relay could also be run on the VM, possibly helping to improve the Tor network.",0,btc,2022-07-15 19:32:59

w17pg0,wisequote,22,https://redd.it/w17pg0,üì∞ Report,The catch 22 of killing Bitcoin,"The catch 22 of killing Bitcoin

1.	We can‚Äôt regulate PoS networks, although they are easily regulatable, because that will provide immediate verification of the PoW networks. This is causing exponential growth in the PoS drift and will make it actually hard for us to regulate PoS networks down the line. What to do?
2.	We can‚Äôt regulate the Lightning Network because if we do regulate those money-transmitting, route-finding LN hubs, we will prove the on-chain use case. This is causing LN to falsely advertise itself as an anon/tor option and is attracting the wrong crowd. It also doesn‚Äôt work so there‚Äôs no point in regulating it.
3.	We can‚Äôt kill TetherUSD because it will kill BTC (and our ability to short BCH infinitely), people will revert back to USING cryptocurrencies rather than speculating on their fiat price and BCH will absolutely shine. We can‚Äôt have that. But Tether is being used by governments we otherwise don‚Äôt allow on SWIFT. We also can‚Äôt have that. 
4.	We cannot define cryptocurrency as a non-commodity because people will use it as cash, so we have to keep that special tax status and collect net gain tax on any transaction. But we‚Äôre losing on collecting ACTUAL cryptocurrency instead of our same old now hyper-inflated currency. How can we combine both when we can‚Äôt?
5.	We can‚Äôt outright ban all cryptocurrency because an all-out ban that quickly fails will make any subsequent banning weightless. Why quickly fails? Because it‚Äôs technically impossible to ban it, or you can only ban yourself from it, but never effectively ban it nor ban others from using it. We have to instead use banning (as a media bang!) to manipulate the market to our liking rather than actually execute said banning.
6.	We can‚Äôt officially adopt it because if people start offering their services for it, offering their produce for it, and using it, we‚Äôre screwed. We then lose on our ability to decide who gets it and who doesn‚Äôt, who gets to keep it and who doesn‚Äôt, and how much we can give ourselves of it. No can do.
7.	We can‚Äôt really create a crypto-like CBDC because it will prove the use-case without having any of the actual electronic-cash hard-money properties (hard-cap, known and automated emission rate, on-chain transparency, up-time, take-down-resistance, etc). 
8.	We can‚Äôt fork it any further because we already sent billionaires after this; we have BCH and from it we also have BSV and XEC and more to come; it just creates noise like the banning-bang we mentioned, but Bitcoin continues unharmed as peer to peer electronic cash right on Bitcoin Cash.
9.	We can try to buy wallets and projects, but many of them are open-source and are not for sale. We bought what we can buy so far, but the biggest issue is that the ones we didn‚Äôt buy are the ones actually being used. We can try to regulate wallets and enforce KYC/AML first and then enforce permission-controls later, but the issue is that only the wallets we bought are implementing it.
10. We can nuke the planet? Hold my beer.",27,btc,2022-07-17 13:43:05

Taking a cue from what is currently happening with Celsius, it has become imperative that you go through the terms and conditions of any project or platform you wish to get involved in.

I have however observed that many don't read through the tiny lines of a project's terms and conditions. If they really do, why would anyone still choose to put funds into Celsius? Knowing that a part of its T&C states that:

In response, I am posting and stickying the entire list of objective facts which it is claimed that we suppress, **to dispel any notion whatsoever that these facts are being suppressed but in fact are widely known, understood, and shared on this sub.**

* FACT: BCH has experienced a continuous decline in price since 2018 (mostly true)

* FACT: BCH has a low adoption rate compared to BTC (mostly true based on # txns and total volume moved)

* FACT: BCH-evangelist Roger Ver was convicted of a felony 20 years ago (in 2002)

It is further claimed that the following are facts, but they are in fact opinions or untruths.  However I will repost them here in the full light of day anyway, because sunlight is the best disinfectant:

* BCH has a low level of development effort and engineering quality

This is an entirely subjective opinion.  In my opinion, BCH has a high level of development effort including 4 distinct full node reference clients, DS proofs, CashFusion, a slew of performance optimizations that enable efficient processing of large blocks up to 200 MB, and many more innovations unique to BCH. More painfully, [it was a BCH engineer who discovered the worst bug in BTC / Bitcoin Core's history](https://cointelegraph.com/news/the-anatomy-of-bitcoin-cores-recent-bug), and instead of exploiting it and wreaking havoc on the ecosystem, made a white-hat report instead)

* BCH mining is centralized

This is an unprovable claim, usually claimed because of the high percentage of anonymous miners who mine BCH.  In reality we can't know how many miners mine anonymously, but in general the same miners who mine BTC blocks also mine BCH blocks.  If you consider the charts for [BTC mining distribution](https://coin.dance/blocks/thisweek) and [BCH mining distribution](https://cash.coin.dance/blocks/thisweek), you'll immediately notice the conspicuous absence of four major SHA256 pools present on the BTC chart but absent on the BCH chart.  Those pools are Foundy USA (22%), Binance (11%), Slush (6%), and Luxor (4%).  Combined they would compose 42% of BCH hashpower, the vast bulk of ""unknown"" mining on BCH.  Considering the substantial abuse levied at mining pools who support BCH it is unsurprising that these pools would choose not to announce their participation in BCH hashpower security.

The player must take a photo of each poster, to show that he has managed to find each and every one of them, through the player will advance the posters will be hidden many more and the locations put in the QR codes will not be so precise in order to give more intensity to the game.

At the end of the game, the user must write to the email that is written on the last poster and this email must send the photo of each of the posters to confirm that the game is complete, in addition to sending your BCH wallet also, once the prize is confirmed it will be deposited immediately.

Tether has deleveraged $17.4 billion from the all-time high of $83.2 billion. But there are still $65.8 billion USDT tokens pumping the price of BTC, with a daily trading volume of roughly the same value. As previously shown, these are mostly wash trades that serve to keep the price up. Tether tokens are backed by very little, and they're not guaranteed to be redeemable.  In the past, Tether just printed more tokens whenever the BTC price went down, whereas now they seem to be cashing out and burning those coins. If they don't print and keep cashing out, it will create a continuous downward pressure on BTC price.

2. **Utility coins that are commonly used for payments will enter wide adoption. Among these are Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Monero (XMR), Stellar (XLM), and ZCash (ZEC).** BCH is already seen in stores and websites and so adoption will just continue to rise up. Monero and ZCash will explode adoption as a reaction to increasing regulation of governments around the world. Stellar will be adopted by central banks and may even be forked to create stablecoins in certain countries.
3. There will be **drastic decline of usage of Ethereum as a blockchain.** No one is using ETH as a currency either. It will become the Netscape of the crypto world.
4. **L2 Ethereum chains will transparently anchor their chains to a fork of Ethereum or may even become their own L1 independent of Ethereum.** Still, dApps works as if they are on Ethereum chain. They will probably mirror how Avalanche implements their C-Chain. Again, no one will rely on Ethereum blockchain 10 years from now.
5. As a reaction, **Ethereum v4 or v5 will follow how some of the L2 chains are doing just to remain in the scene.** There will be a split in the community on whether to call this new Ethereum as still Ethereum or by another name. Most will go with the latter.
6. Most of ERC-20 coins and most of the other blockchains' tokens will only remain as a trading token. No real world use will be done on most of these tokens.
7. **Tokens that are pegged into something will have the highest survival in the trading scene.** There will be an explosion of tokens pegged to something some time 5 years from now. **Tokenization of Things (TOT)** will be rampant (am I the first one to coin this term?). People will realize that it's the only way to make the tokens relevant. However, expect weird ""peggings"" of tokens (e.g. tokens pegged to old stocks of pc parts, tokenization of construction materials, tokenization of toy collections, pegging an EGG token to real and future yields of farm eggs, etc.)
8. Respective governments and financial regulatory bodies will enact laws that will only accept a certain cryptocurrency if that chain provides a way for them to have a backdoor access OR if the implementation of the chain in that country is amenable to deep scrutiny.
9. And so most stablecoins will be heavily regulated. **There will be an explosion of stablecoins 5-7 years from now.** Almost every country will have their own stablecoin or will digitize their cash.
10. Some of the USD stablecoins will merge. It may be possible that USDC will takeover USDT to consolidate their stance as a stablecoin. **The trend will be that the weaker stablecoins will be acquired by the stronger ones.** They will do these to prevent a government ""takeover"" of the scene regarding stablecoins.
11. And related #10, **US will continue to have stablecoins that are privately controlled.** These companies will make sure that the government will not be able to centrally manage the stablecoins. In other countries it will be the government who will centrally manage the stablecoins, including its on-and-off ramp mechanisms.
12. **Ripple's future will depend on the court proceedings happening now.** Until that is finalized, Ripple's future is hazy. This is not a prediction but an obvious thing happening right now. **However, if within 3 years from now nothing is happening, other countries will move on to other blockchains like Stellar, Avalanche, or Algorand to implement their CBDC.**
13. **Some authoritarian countries will tokenize their citizens' social rating.** Each citizen will have a ""social token"" that they can use to transact in that country.
14. Other countries may follow the trend but on a lesser degree (e.g. Tokenization of credit rating, academic achievement, research rankings, etc.)
15. **Quantum computers will still not have the power to break the cryptography of the current blockchains.** Still, most blockchains will implement some quantum resistant mechanism on top of their current chain. Further still, **most new blockchains that will be launched 5 years from now will be quantum-first and privacy-first blockchains.**

The debate over¬†stablecoin¬†regulation largely hinges on whether to treat issuers like banks or money-market mutual funds. The bill being proffered by Waters and McHenry falls more on the side of treating them like banks, not only requiring compliance with federal supervision but also adherence to capital and liquidity rules.

Consequently, the bill would also authorize stringent requirements for the assets used to back a stablecoin. Supposedly, this will reduce the risks of destabilizing fire sales of those assets in a crisis. Other restrictions would include prohibiting non-financial companies from issuing such products and imposing a stricter separation between financial firms and tech companies.

In the U.K., 2009 Banking Act Amended to Incorporate Stablecoin Regulations

As per the bill, Her Majesty‚Äôs Treasury department will be in charge of drafting all regulations pertaining to the payment systems, issuers, and services providers of digital settlement assets (DSA).

As per the bill, the Bank of England will be in charge of establishing the rules that will regulate how DSA service providers function. Meanwhile, the FCA (Financial Conduct Authority) will be permitted to weigh in on regulations and actions that seek to foster the proper function of these entities except under specific circumstances such as those that may threaten to destabilize the UK‚Äôs financial system.

Bitcoin Cash is the Bitcoin that works and that you don't need any central authority to use; it is in fast money, and it works just like Bitcoin did just before 2017. Bitcoin Cash is not a fork of Bitcoin. It is indeed Bitcoin and has Satoshi's coin in its blockchain. It may seem like BCH is a fork of BTC, but it is not.

w504h6,phillipsjk,21,https://redd.it/w504h6,ü§î Opinion,The Tether fraud is worse than it seems.,"Obviously fraud is bad, who is really hurt? Speculators?

The answer is everybody on the planet.

1. Tether is used to signal a false price for the limited Bitcoin Core chain in a hope that once the fork is ""decided"" by the ""market"", Bitcoin Cash supporters would simply give up.
2. But we can't give up without giving up on cryptocurrency in general (neglecting XMR, DASH, etc). BCH outperforms BTC in every way: so the price of BTC can't be allowed to fall below the price of BCH.
3. November of 2017 shit hits the fan. Price of BCH rises to 0.2BTC each. Every major exchange halts trading simultaneously through some combination of excessive load, DDOS, or exchanges over-reliant on BTC pairs just letting things cool off.
4. Now the price of BTC can't even be allowed to fall. Market manipulation happens in earnest: distorting the market.
5. The ""market"" is telling miners to mine BTC to the detriment of everything else. Due to nicehash only paying out in BTC, this has spill-over effects into ASIC-resistant mining as well.
6. This leads to the first [second, depending how you count] video card shortage. I bought my ""white elephant"" quad CPU  machine because I was not interested in bidding for GPUs.
7. Things settle down, and I am able to buy a GPU for a reasonable price. But now hardware vendors know there is a (distorted) demand for mining . They need to put in their order at TSMC 2 years ahead of time.
8. 2019: the large chip buys based on anticipated mining demand (not discouraged by the continued high price of BTC) lead to a chip shortage.
9. 2020: pandemic hits, straining supply chains. Computer demand skyrockets with people working from home. I watch as even the crappiest 15W video cards sell out at my local retailers (was considering buying one, but figured others needed them more).
10. People start to notice that BTC, and by implication all cryptocurrency, is essentially a Ponzi scheme. They start to ask questions like: why does it use so much power if hardly anybody uses it? (I firmly believe such questions would be a lot more muted if BCH was the dominant coin: because it actually has a use-case.)

So in summary: Tether distorted the market so much that they screwed over the global economy; and possibly the environment for the next 50 years at the same time.",31,btc,2022-07-22 03:28:02

You can be right about Bitcoin Cash being the real Bitcoin, but you can be wrong in its timing and, as such, lose a lot of money in the process. When I say that Bitcoin Cash will take over Bitcoin Core BTC, I mean that BCH will have more acquiring power against any other asset, either fiat currency or Bitcoin Core itself, but it won't happen without pain.

I know SHA256 miners can switch between the chain they mine on without much difficulty. So why do they mine so much more on BTC? I can imagine 3 reasons as to why miners do this:

1) It is because blocks are not full and miners don't get enough transaction fees.

2) It is because MEV is greater on BTC. The question still would be why.

3) It is because miners have a reason to prefer one over the other.

Unfortunately I could not find out if transaction fees are considered in the source linked above. If they are not included then this would be an easy explanation since there actually is competition for block space on BTC while BCH blocks are hardly ever full.

MEV might also make sense since it is based on the miners ability to give a transaction higher priority. This is obviously more valuable if block space is very limited.

Or option 3 plays and I just haven't figured it out yet. Maybe it's really about what miners prefer to hold on their balance sheet / what they want their worth to be denominated in.

w91qo5,Joe_Omg,8,https://redd.it/w91qo5,‚ö†Ô∏è Alert ‚ö†Ô∏è,BE CAUTIOUS!!,"Like many on this subreddit, I have supported bch since its inception, I have supported its vision and its decentralization model. And even though the market has not favored us thanks to the proliferation of ponzi projects taking all the attention of new users I still believe in the greatness and potential of this chain.

Likewise I have supported smartbch and have been a part of its community for many months now. We have had a tough year due to the crypto winter and all the coinflex controversy. The last thing I want to see is that this ecosystem continues to be hurt by selfish interests that do not share the vision on which sbch and bch were created.

Even so, this is not the only thing that has happened, we have had other blows but they have gone more unnoticed. Maybe some may not remember you but earlier this year benswap did a sort of rugpull through accumulating assets in the farms of each smartbch dex and then after a while pulling it all out at once and placing it in their own dex. A selfish move, harmful and with all malice aforethought I think. To some extent this is still happening.

Even their developers talk without any restraint about how they don't want to be part of smartbch, so it would be no surprise if one day we wake up and no longer see them anywhere in the ecosystem.  After all we've been through I fear some clueless person here will fall for some promise/contest/event or whatever coming from these developers.

Everything I have said is nothing more than my opinion based on the facts presented this year, I will be happy to read your opinions on this. And remember, I write this with the best of intentions towards the community.

w94e85,SmoothOperator9000,2,https://redd.it/w94e85,None,Does diversification make sense nowadays?,"In 2017 when I entered crypto you had so many ""amazing"" options. At least this is how it looked like. Majority of platform coins have disappeared from top 100: Lisk, Stratis, Ark, Qtum, some are still there but have almost no volume on exchanges left, like Neo. With currencies is a bit different because even tho coins like BCH, LTC dropped out of top 10 they're still challenging for the top spots, the adoption is growing, number of active wallets etc. But then coins like DGB, Nano, XEM, Dash got completely destroyed to pieces and no one even wants to touch them. We can call this phenomenon ""survival of the fittest"", coins with the strongest believers, most adoption and best use case survive the rest get wiped out. 

Now we are in 2022. You may think why is this time different, shitcoins will perform similar to how they performed in all previous cycles. Well let me tell ya, just 2-3 years ago I was able to use Binance without KYC,  same for Gate io, I was able to buy any promising shitcoin below top 100 and was confident if I buy them they gonna go up in value, but now I'm becoming skeptical. This time you may think you got a good deal, but what if you just became a sad bagholder, liquidity drops to zero and your shitcoin becomes worthless?

How many coins are going to survive with all these restrictions being implemented? Maybe top 40 at best.  Some experts will say stick to top 10 or top 20, but I disagree. As I stated above, majority of platforms in 2-3 years get replaced with never ones. So I don't have much confidence in ADA, SOL, Dot etc. Nowadays I pretty much stick with buying BCH and XMR, everything else I consider gambling.",7,btc,2022-07-27 03:57:29

w9nw5m,saylor_moon,30,https://redd.it/w9nw5m,üì∞ Report,What happened at Coinflex? A timeline,"On June 23rd, 2022 Coinflex announced that it was halting all user withdrawals.  Unusually suspicious circumstances surrounding this have transformed this seemingly ordinary insolvency case into an ongoing investigation of suspected fraud.

Timeline of events:

**February 1**

Genesis Trading [raises interest rates](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/si8bug/bch_shorters_are_getting_desperate_and_they_are/) offered to borrow BCH through the Gemini Earn program.  This leads to suspicion that someone intends to short sell a large amount of BCH.

**April 1**

Interest rates to borrow BCH [are again raised](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/ttzarh/after_just_1_month_gemini_yet_again_raises/), now to 5.33%, much higher than other similar cryptocurrencies.

**April 6**

Approximately 462,000 BCH is sent to Coinflex main wallet, mostly from [this address](https://bitinfocharts.com/bitcoin%20cash/address/1FjHwcUf7rptVA7Pa3r3RGcdFaNwVYfCwJ) which had been slowly accumulating BCH for months. Coinflex CEO Mark Lamb later [denies](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/w5beu2/comment/ih8ynhr/) that this came from Genesis, and stated it was deposits from customers.

**May 9**

Over a few days, roughly 462,000 BCH is removed from [Coinflex main wallet](https://bitinfocharts.com/bitcoin%20cash/address/1PJ1rJhedQ5yP8NaCj5J2nAm5pM2hy8pkv)

**May 31**

A large amount of BCH is [deposited at Binance](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/v1lgmx/binaince_accumulating_about_1mln_bch_on_their_hot/), much of it from Coinflex.

**June 13**

Celsius Network halts withdrawals, triggering panic selling of many crypto assets.  Much of the BCH that had been [deposited at Binance](https://bitinfocharts.com/bitcoin%20cash/address/19dQkvaH2NGgkGomzZu3qrnqRGCicXwedM) is sold at this time, causing an especially large price decline in BCH.

Speculators are seen taking advantage of low prices by [buying large amounts](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/vbmq49/on_coinbase_the_majority_of_trades_are_purchases/) of BCH, often more than a [million dollars at a time](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/vizg41/on_multiple_exchanges_we_see_1020k_of_bch_bids_in/).  However, there is very little BCH for sale at any exchanges other than Binance, and [arbitrageurs](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/vdkplz/on_coinbase_kraken_gemini_bitstamp_there_are_buy/) continuously withdraw from Binance to sell at other exchanges.

**June 18**

18,000 BCH is withdrawn from Coinflex and [mixed with Cashfusion](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/w0d9jg/coinflex_loot_now_being_cashfusioned/).

An additional [10,928 BCH](https://blockchair.com/bitcoin-cash/transaction/0ad32ab73ac6fb5db51bbb0a32fcecf6f48d5e1378f5ad317d84a4ab58633b34?i=0) is then withdrawn and mixed, for a total worth approximately $3.5 million USD at the time.

**June 23**

Citing ""extreme market conditions last week & continued uncertainty involving a counterparty,"" Coinflex [halts all withdrawals](https://coinflex.com/blog/coinflex-update-on-withdrawals/).

Coinflex [later explains](https://coinflex.com/blog/coinflexs-solution-to-resume-withdrawls/), ""a long-time customer of CoinFLEX‚Äôs account went into negative equity, meaning the Individual‚Äôs account currently holds a negative balance.""

**June 24**

Coinflex CEO Mark Lamb [repeatedly denies](https://twitter.com/Cryptadamist/status/1541904986531037186) that Coinflex is [selling BCH at Binance](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/vizg41/comment/idka39o/).

**June 28**

[Rumors](https://twitter.com/FatManTerra/status/1541778973511884802) begin to spread that the customer is Roger Ver.  However, Roger Ver was not short selling, but had a long position.

Roger Ver [denies](https://twitter.com/rogerkver/status/1541822377461415936) owing money to Coinflex, and claims Coinflex owes him money.

Coinflex CEO Mark Lamb [says](https://twitter.com/MarkDavidLamb/status/1541831697787928576) ""Roger Ver owes CoinFLEX $47 Million USDC.""

**July 2**

Doug Polk, who Coinflex had a marketing agreement with, [claims he was deceived](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/vps8o1/doug_polk_full_statement_on_coinflex_situation/).  Coinflex had told him that assets were fully collateralized, which was untrue, and that Roger Ver was ""just an investor"" and not involved in the operation of the company.

**July 10**

Despite withdrawals ostensibly being halted, [100,000 BCH is withdrawn](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/vvitgf/coinflex_selling_more_bch/) from Coinflex, of which [68,000 BCH](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/vvitgf/comment/iflyvw0/) is sold at Binance. Mark Lamb [continues to claim](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/w5beu2/comment/ihc3juh) that Coinflex is not selling at Binance, and that these are ""withdrawals from our users, to Binance.""

**July 14**

Coinflex offers [limited withdrawals](https://coinflex.com/blog/update-july-14-2022/) of 10% of account balances if users agree to their new terms.

**July 22**

Coinflex CEO Mark Lamb states that Coinflex does not intend to [file for bankruptcy](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/w5beu2/comment/ih77xej/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3).

wac8gv,YeOldDoc,30,https://redd.it/wac8gv,üá´ Misleading Title üõë,Lightning ‚ö° Tutorial: 13 easy steps ü§ì to receive without custodian or prior funds.,"**This post remains being labeled as misleading, even though it clearly describes how to receive via LN without a custodian and without having prior funds. Nobody could explain who the custodian in this scenario is supposed to be (there is none) and at which point prior funds are required (they are not). Still, the misleading label remains. So much for being uncensored, r/btc.**
 
***

There is a recurrent misconception in this sub often caused by FUD, that it would not be possible to receive funds via the LN without

- putting the same amount of funds in the wallet first or
- owning already at least enough funds to pay for the channel opening.

With this easy tutorial of **only 13 steps** I'd like to explain how **everybody with basic technology skills** can receive funds on the LN **without owning any prior funds** and in particular **without using a custodian** or **trusting the wallet developers**.

All you need is your smart phone, basic technology skills and a cup of coffee. Are you ready? There is also a [detailed video tutorial of the steps](https://twitter.com/yeolddoc/status/1552646526610063360) or you can simply follow these instructions (make sure to not skip a step):


- **Step 1**: install LN Wallet [Breez](https://breez.technology/)
- **Step 2**: generate a LN invoice and have the sender pay it
- **Step 3**: take a sip of your coffee, you are done. There is no **Step 3**.
- **Step 4**: you can immediately spend the funds anywhere you like while with other crypto
- **Step 5**: **you might have to wait for confirmations**, for example exchanges must be very diligent when crediting deposits, 
- **Step 6**: because they **risk losing a lot of money** when a chain reorg happens.
- **Step 7**: the risk of longer chain reorgs increases with low hashrate. bch for example requires 170 blocks to reach the same PoW as Bitcoin, which is why many larger exchanges like **Kraken**, **nexo.io**, **CEX.IO** and others make
- **Step 8**: **you wait between 10 to 16 confirmations** to credit a bch deposit, which causes a delay of 1 to 2.5 hours
- **Step 9**: Breez is open source so you can [**compile the source code yourself**](https://github.com/breez/breezmobile) and 
- **Step 10**: if you want to, **specify which server to connect to**. on the other hand the popular bch wallet
- **Step 11**: made by bitcoin.com is closed source, so **you don't know what happens to your keys** and 
- **Step 12**: they will only connect to their own servers, so with them
- **Step 13**: **you need to put in a lot of trust and hope that it works and no funds are lost**
 
**That's it. Congratulations, you have now received your first ever satoshis via Lightning. You have likely noticed that you did not receive the full amount that was sent, but that Breez has deducted 2000 sats or 0.4% from the first incoming transfer in order to pay for the channel opening.  Next time, you'll receive the full amount. Have fun using Lightning!**

****

Update: How does this magic work, you might wonder:

When we tell the app to receive e.g. 10K sats the app notices we don't have a channel yet. It will then create **two** invoices with the same secret preimage only we know:

- one for 10K issued to the sender and paid to us via a not yet created (let's call it ""virtual"") channel between us and our future channel counterparty (Breez) and
- another one for 8K (10K - opening fees), which is issued to (and has to be paid by) our future channel counterparty (Breez).

Now you likely have two very good questions:

1. How is the 10K payment supposed to find a route to us when the only channel we have is still virtual and hasn't been confirmed or gossiped yet?
2. What is the purpose of the 8K invoice (Breez->Us), do we get 18K total?

We solve the first question by including in the 10K invoice an instruction to route the funds via our future channel counterparty (Breez), so that the funds will take the same route as if the channel had already been established.

When the sender of the 10K makes the payment and the Lightning Network tries to route the funds as instructed via Breez's node, Breez's node will pretend to ""sleep"" when it is their turn to forward the payment via the virtual channel to us (note that it can't claim the 10K for itself because they don't know the secret preimage that only we know). It can't sleep for long, because otherwise the LN payment will fail. Now this happens:

Our future channel counterparty (Breez) opens a channel with us over let's say 1M sats (depending on how much opening fees we were willing to pay) - 1M sats on their side and 0 sats on our side. Our wallet can verify that the opening tx is valid and has been broadcasted (but it won't be confirmed for another ~10 minutes and we are in a hurry).

So where are we now? The 10K payment is currently still in transit because Breez node is still sleeping but they also can't claim it cause they don't know the preimage. And we have a channel with nothing on our side but at least 1M sats of inbound liquidity, but it's only in the mempools and not yet confirmed.

Final steps: Breez pays the 8K invoice to us via the unconfirmed channel but in order to receive it, we need to tell Breez the preimage in return. Breez can now use this preimage in the still pending payment of the 10K to ""prove"" to the previous node in the route that it forwarded the payment, which will shift the balance in Breez's channel with the previous node by 10K to Breez's side. As a result, they can only receive 10K if they send us 8K before.

So now we have a channel that we and our counterparty treat as if it was already confirmed and nobody else cares. We can verify it is valid, has sufficient fees, no RBF flag and that it has been added to the mempools (at least with regard to the nodes we query about it). At this point it is similar to the pros and cons of traditional 0-conf tx which will *likely* be confirmed in 10 minutes. In fact it is a bit better than 0-conf, because we can **immediately** spend the 8K via the LN or use a submarine swap to retrieve it on-chain without requiring any confirmation. If we do that, even if the opening transaction would be orphaned or double spent or fees would rise abruptly, we wouldn't have lost any funds. (In comparison, a traditional, failed 0-conf will make every child tx based on it fail too). 

But, should Breez decide to go rogue and attack by double spending the opening transaction, the wallet would notice but wouldn't be able to do anything about it and the funds still on our side of the channel would be lost. So while this is not risk-free, it is certainly of low risk because

- spending the received funds removes risk completely
- risk vanishes after 1-3 confirmations 
- typically only smaller amounts involved (send small funds for opening, larger funds after confirmation)
- public proof of Breez's double spend will damage reputation and thus future fee earnings

There you have it. Receiving funds without a custodian and without owning prior funds. And since I know the LN FUDsters here: Thieves are not ""custodians"" because they can potentially steal your money. You also don't need to trust ""thieves"" to not steal your funds.",0,btc,2022-07-28 15:02:05

* **SmartBCH is 99.9% insolvent**
* **CashTokens are at least a year away**

**If you're a BUIDLer on Bitcoin Cash, this is FAST approaching hopelessness** üò≥

I just watched Mark Lamb's latest AMA.   
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R62Q4TN-QE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R62Q4TN-QE)

It is abundantly clear that 12 months is the most realistic timeline for any resolution of the SmartBCH Treasuries and a restoration of the $BCH <=> $BCH bridge.

**Where is the SmartBCH core team?**

I'm fairly disappointed that not a single person from the SmartBCH team responded to the Bailout Plan that I proposed in their official GitHub repo   
\-> [https://github.com/smartbch/smartbch/issues/64](https://github.com/smartbch/smartbch/issues/64)

But I KNOW the team is still working hard. They just released SmartBCH v0.4.5 ([https://github.com/smartbch/smartbch/releases/tag/v0.4.5](https://github.com/smartbch/smartbch/releases/tag/v0.4.5)) a week ago. And just 2 days ago, the team released a new batch of SHA-Gate2 CashScript covenants [https://github.com/smartbch/cc-covenant](https://github.com/smartbch/cc-covenant) *(so they're presumably still active on GitHub)*

**But there's a Problem!**

I'll start with the fact that I've seen little to no actual ""work"" (ie. commits) shown in their SHA-Gate repos. This isn't inherently a problem, but it's still a lil sus .. Then there was an immediate red-flag when I saw they are using `bitbox-sdk`. This library was abandoned 2 years ago; and still utilizes now defunct REST APIs. So it's quite clear that this ""FRESH & NEW"" code doesn't work! *(or at least has never been tested by anyone from their team)*

Imho, the core SmartBCH team just doesn't have what it takes to build a ""decentralized"" bridge, even though they continue to promise one will ""eventually"" be delivered. From DAY 1, their focus has always been on SHA-Gate, and no one has EVER mentioned how the other HALF (the $SBCH side) of the bridge will be handled. There currently sits approx. $3B in $SBCH assets that absolutely NO ONE seems to be talking about, smh..

[https://sonar.cash/address/0x8c4F85ec71C966e45A6F4291f5271f8114a7Ba15/transactions](https://sonar.cash/address/0x8c4F85ec71C966e45A6F4291f5271f8114a7Ba15/transactions)

**And where are the SmartBCH developers?**

A few big names have already announced plans to migrate cross-chain. And what hope is there to attract NEW developers to the ecosystem? As a result of what I'll refer to as Bridgegate 2022, the HackSmart hackathon (scheduled for end of June) was indefinitely canceled.

[https://hacksmart.org/](https://hacksmart.org/)

**Realistically, what are SmartBCH BUIDLers supposed to do with an insolvent blockchain??**

If it was the desire of Mark & Co. to destroy the hopes and dreams of a nascent Bitcoin sidechain and everyone who believed in it, then they have succeeded by leaps and bounds. Congratulations!! This is a vivid reminder of the time (back in '13) when Bitcoin Core developers slashed the OP\_RETURN from 80 bytes to 40 bytes and effectively killed ALL development of ""colored coins"" (later known as SLP).

*If this be the will of the Crypto Gods, well then so be it, but my journey continues...*

For anyone who hasn't already done so, I'd love some feedback on my SmartBCH Bailout Plan   
\-> [https://sbx.cash/bailout](https://sbx.cash/bailout) 

and certainly appreciate any contributions to the MVP campaign   
\-> [https://flipstarter.sbx.cash](https://flipstarter.sbx.cash)

Based on their performance over the past year, I absolutely maintain hope that Wang Kui and his team will deliver a miracle that brings a path forward for the future of SmartBCH. But after a month of nothing from the BODAO, very little action from SmartBCH devs, and (imo) nonsense code solutions from the core team ... I'm not holding my breath ü•∫

Fortunately Bitcoin enables pure financial sovereignty: that means I have final authority over what happens to to my money. There is no authority who defines what my Bitcoin are. My Bitcoin aren't defined by a majority, or an institution, or a standards board, or a government.

My Bitcoin are defined by the rules that I choose to enforce. 99.99% of the world can decide Bitcoin should be something different from the Peer-to-peer Electronic Cash System that myself and the other OG Bitcoiners invested in, but if I don't consent to that change, then my Bitcoin remain unaffected.

The system I invested in was a Peer-to-peer Electronic Cash System, where any two willing parties can make casual hard-currency transactions with no need of an intermediary, where fees are always negligible, where the first-seen version of a transaction is generally considered to be the valid transaction, and where blocks get bigger as the economy grows. The system I invested in was supposed to be upgraded with larger blocks via a hard fork block size increase before the block size limit became an economic inhibitor. The system I invested in was **cash.**

BCH represented the liberation of the Bitcoin project from its attackers: the naysayers who claimed that the system as designed by Satoshi Nakamoto was untenable, that it wouldn't scale, and that it could only work by reintroducing financial funds-routing middlemen and the inherent loss of sovereignty that comes with them.

Today is the 5th anniversary of the liberation of the Bitcoin project and the continuation of the original project, which others call ""Bitcoin Cash"" but which to me will always just be ""Bitcoin.""

One thing I have noticed is on a lot of exchanges if you look at sell orders and market depth someone is opening large fake sale orders that is making the market depth chart look way off like there is a ton more selling pressure then what is really taking place. These orders only open for a few seconds and then close and open again clearly a bot. This is the same for a few other coins but not stuff like BTC or ETH. 

The problem I have with the price is I believe it should be much much much higher because the coins in circulation would be much less then BTC because you have people that probably moved coins before splitting so they are lost forever plus any coins that were mined before BTC that were lost would also be lost on the BCH chain.

As a regular user of BCH, I would like to share this post with everyone to add to the growing knowledge and experience of BCH users around the world. I hope we get a good discussion on this topic and read some of your comments related to your country's use of Bitcoin Cash.

**Cryptocurrency Landscape in the Philippines**

In the Philippines where millions are unbanked, cryptocurrency seems to be a panacea until you realize that there are only two on and off ramp exchanges that are approved to operate by the central bank of the Philippines (Banko Sentral ng Pilipinas). These are [Coins.ph](https://Coins.ph) and PDAX (Philippine Digital Asset Exchange). There may be others that I don't know but it does not matter as only these two have a usable and currently operating mechanism to buy, sell, and trade cryptocurrency to another cryptocurrency and fiat.

Of course you can always use a peer to peer hand off money from someone you meet online BUT crypto-fiat trading is way more secure with an approved exchange. [Binance does not have a license to trade in the Philippines](https://news.coincu.com/97198-binance-getting-license-philippines/) and for now serves only as an escrow app for peer to peer exchange aside from other features like liquidity pools, swaps, etc.

Among the cryptocurrencies, BTC, BCH, XRP, ETH and its various ERC-20 tokens like AXS, BAT, DOT, MANA, MATIC, SAND, to name a few, are available to [Coins.ph](https://Coins.ph), while the same list is available via PDAX with the addition of ADA, AVAX, SOL, and XLM.

Both of the approved exchanges works using a mobile app which serves as a custodial wallet. You can convert fiat (Philippine Peso only) to cryptocurrency and vice versa via these apps without additional fess other than conversion rates fees between crypto and fiat.

**Payments Using Cryptocurrency in the Philippines**

Between [Coins.ph](https://Coins.ph) and PDAX, only [Coins.ph](https://Coins.ph) allows you to pay cryptocurrency to others using QR Code, crypto address, or to a cellphone number of a [Coins.ph](https://Coins.ph) user.

If the receiver or the merchant is a [Coins.ph](https://Coins.ph) user, payment is fast because [Coins.ph](https://Coins.ph) will act as a liquidity pool exchange for any of the supported cryptocurrency vis-a-vis Philippine Peso. Funds will reflect to the other account almost in real time without the need for confirmation time.

If the receiver or merchant uses a non-custodial wallet, paying using cryptocurrency will be subjected to the respective blockchain's confirmation time and gas fees. And this is where BCH shines among the rest.

Since 2018, I never encountered any brick-and-mortar business that accepts cryptocurrency here. There are online businesses that accepts cryptocurrency, and I did had a business before the pandemic where I accepted cryptocurrency. No one paid me in crypto within 3 years of making it available as a payment option even with 10% discount.

Adoption of cryptocurrency in the Philippines is growing but it is still a super minority that focuses on trading.

**Bitcoin Cash as the Most Usable and Accessible Cryptocurrency**

From my experience, I never used BTC using [Coins.ph](https://Coins.ph) because the transfer time is too long and the fees can go up to $1.50. My average BTC confirmation time is 30 minutes. Contrast that with BCH where the highest fee is just $0.01 and the confirmation times is 5 minutes on the average.

While XRP is available in [Coins.ph](https://Coins.ph), I can only receive funds but not send due to unresolved bug. Of course no one can use ETH and its related tokens because gas fees are stucked at $15-20.

This leaves the Philippines with only one usable and accessible cryptocurrency for payments and transfers - Bitcoin Cash.

**How About MoneyGram and Stellar?**

Recently, MoneyGram partnered with Stellar to make USDC transfers available to the Philippines and to convert it to Philippine Peso seamlessly during cash-out. It uses Stellar as the network to make these transfer almost in real time. However, fees are still higher compared to cryptocurrency transfers. The last time I tried, $100 will cost approximately $5 of fees plus any conversion rates fees.

Also, there's a KYC needed that includes an identification card and home address validation.

This is definitely not in the spirit of cryptocurrency despite using Stellar's blockchain technology. But for those who are very familiar with MoneyGram and trusts it as a remittance partner, it may soon be the preferred way of transferring USD in and out of the Philippines.

**Adoption Challenges**

I saw other BCH users doing their own campaign in their local vicinity. I wanted to do the same but given that we can only off ramp BCH via these 2 exchanges without incurring higher fees from other methods, it's very difficult to promote BCH without mentioning the other two exchanges and not sounding like a salesperson for them.

How can I say to them that they need to create a BCH wallet and address, accept payments, then have the hassle of transferring it to [Coins.ph](https://Coins.ph) then convert it to Philippine Peso at a lower price due to conversion? There is no incentive for them.

Literacy about cryptocurrency in general is also low, with some sectors and localities not even have basic understanding of using these apps altogether. Internet access is also a problem in other localities.

And the fact that most are unbanked, moving any money in the digital space is a challenge and centralized only to the two exchange I mentioned above.

**Final Words**

Despite the challenges and limitations, Bitcoin Cash seems to be the only viable solution for those who want to use cryptocurrency to pay and transfer cash. Given it has the head start of being usable and accessible, any adoption campaigns for cryptocurrency in the Philippines should include Bitcoin Cash.

People may not fully understand all the blockchain and cryptocurrency dynamics. They may only know Bitcoin among others. But by the time they use it for payment and see the fees, or even experience how slow it is first hand, they will gravitate to use the next recognizable cryptocurrency - Bitcoin Cash.

weqtfz,1bch1musd,32,https://redd.it/weqtfz,None,Reminder: Lightning is a PERMISSIONED network.,"Opening channels requires counter party approvals.

To pay Merchant via Lightning you must first have their approval to open a channel.

Can you imagine an ordinary Merchant opening channels and keeping track of banking accounts for every single one of their customers?

The likely scenario, the Merchant would only seek approval to open channels with big LN HUB.  To access the merchant you need to go through the LN HUB.

Here's the catch: You also need approval from LN HUB, for channel creation, to then access their network of merchants.

LN HUB would be entity with large funds and liquidity (more commonly known as BANKS). At best your ass is gonna get KYC. At worst, you are on a blacklist and not allowed to participate in any commerce.

Doesn't this model not remind you of the current Credit Card system?",45,btc,2022-08-02 23:40:39

wezqr1,abracaduma,6,https://redd.it/wezqr1,None,let's talk business,"*thought*
--
each cryptocurrency is like their own startup/company and the employees are the coin holders. anyone can join, add value, and participate in profits.
&nbsp;

- what is our mission?  
- how are we doing?  
- forward thoughts
&nbsp;

*mission*
--
our mission is to bring more economic freedom to the world. we do this by offering a p2p electronic cash system which is fast, simple, reliable, low cost, and decentralized. as adoption of our product (BCH) grows, the likelihood of it becoming the new global reserve currency grows. this takes power away from money-printing, centralized, corruptible governments and gives it to the people (decentralized, un-corruptible).
&nbsp;

*how are we doing?*
--
like any company, we can measure bottom-line success by tracking market share growth against competitors (fiat/other crypto). currently seems like we're struggling in this area, but there are indications of strong underlying growth (merchant adoption, BCH adopted as legal tender) which should pave the way to increasing market share over time.
&nbsp;

*forward  thoughts*
--
focusing on worldwide adoption seems like the right approach. i think another effective way to gain market share is to onboard  influencers. i was surprised Elon Musk didn't end up joining the BCH camp since i thought his interests aligned a lot with ours (furthering humanity). im pretty sure if he did join, it would've been the catalyst for BCH to overtake BTC. but i wonder if we could onboard other people/groups that could have the same effect?
not sure how we would onboard them or if it's even possible. maybe there's someone really smart out there that can figure this out.  
any strategies you can think of? who are some good candidates that also align closely with the mission?",8,btc,2022-08-03 07:10:53

for BCHN & Core (after making a back-up of the executables & `cd` to their directory). For [BCHD](https://github.com/gcash/bchd) (& maybe BTCD?) build using

`go build -ldflags -s`

*bchd.exe* comes out **17 MiB** instead of **24 MiB**. I'm testing its grpc at [tinos.ml](https://tinos.ml).

`strip *` can be run inside Linux, or in Windows I downloaded the *posix-sjlj* [release](https://github.com/niXman/mingw-builds-binaries/releases) for mingw64, & then appended its extracted *bin* directory to the *Path* environmental variable (from Start Menu type *advanced system settings*).

At first I was disappointed by the results following official build instructions for BCHN ([here](https://gitlab.com/bitcoin-cash-node/bitcoin-cash-node/-/blob/master/doc/build-windows.md)) & Bitcoin Core ([here](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/build-windows.md)), but eventually I realized they were missing the `strip *` command. BCHN gave a strange warning when running it, but that [issue](https://gitlab.com/bitcoin-cash-node/bitcoin-cash-node/-/issues/278) is apparently resolved with the  `-DCLIENT_VERSION_IS_RELEASE` flag. Without stripping, the *bitcoin-qt.exe* can be **415 MiB** instead of under **31 MiB**.

Core also has native Windows build [instructions](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/tree/master/build_msvc) which I haven't tried yet. So far I've only been able to build **BCHD** natively in Windows. I haven't been able to build BCH Unlimited yet.

In this technology appeals to anybody for experimentation come join us and let's have  some fun.

After my Bitcoin cash search game, which was pleasantly received by the community and I thank you for it.

I have taken on the task of designing and planning this new project.

What will be the basis of this? It will consist of 6 banners, which will be of a considerable size and attractive to the public eye, these will be positioned in 6 important points of my city.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/kt0unlao5zg91.jpg?width=700&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4a4daff8e974fb3bf9b7bb68b6c1286710d5aae7

These banners will be divided into 4 dynamic and simple steps as you can see.

These steps will motivate anyone who sees it to:

&#x200B;

1. Download their Bitcoin Cash Wallet.
2. Know and learn more about Bitcoin cash.
3. Be part of our core communities on Reddit.
4. Know BCH sub-projects and invite more people to be part of this project.

The points where these banners will be positioned are places where hundreds of people are treated daily, so the expectation with this project is very great.

1.45 BCH are necessary to carry out this project, so once I manage to collect them, I will start this project.

As with my previous project, I will make a post showing the results.

The first one is this one. https://etherscan.io/address/0x88e6a0c2ddd26feeb64f039a2c41296fcb3f5640

It's the Uniswap V3 pool of USDC/ETH, it currently contains [110 million USDC](https://i.imgur.com/bYbnmqc.png) and the equivalent in ETH. 

They do the same with the remaining 9 biggest liquidity pools of USDC/ other asset. Sushipswap USDC/ETH, bankor USDC/ETH, and also other USDC pairs like USDC/USDT etc etc.

What happens next?

Let's go through all the possible questions:


1) Does Circle just push these new addresses when they upgrade their USDC contract without thinking about the consequences? 


[Here is how that looks like on chain.](https://i.imgur.com/F89hijh.png)



source: https://etherscan.io/tx/0x692c4c53bde8008fcc1f770d9b7cb99202a7b8b23540611b90589c0e0d90b5e5 

2) What is the difference in USDC their contract between putting an address on the blacklist or a CA?

3) What happens when Circle pushes something like 0x88e6a0c2ddd26feeb64f039a2c41296fcb3f5640 in to the USDC CA's blacklist? This is USDC/ETH on Uniswap v3

4) Can liquidity providers still open up their LP tokens and get their ETH back or does the error on the USDC side prevent that? 

5) What happens to how the price of USDC/ETH is displayed when all the USDC is frozen?

6) How do price oracles like CHAINLINK deal with this? Will they report wrong prices. 

7) What kind of cascade effect could this possibly have in the Ethereum DeFi ecosystem? 

8) How much money could Nancy Pelosi and her husband make with this and how much risk. 


9) Does Circle even care? Anytime the US Treasury tells them to freeze USDC they are basically telling them to destroy an IOU for real dollars which means Circle is now richer. They have bancking that can't be claimed anymore with the corresponding IOU, since that IOU has been frozen.",0,btc,2022-08-11 13:03:28

So if we assume both BTC and BCH are of equal unit value, their fee would be equal at 1 sat/byte, which is around 0.00000236 BTC/BCH (and sometimes less in BTC, as it uses SegWit to cut down on fee). Not going into details on SegWit, there's a claim Roger made when Tone said ""no one uses BCH"", that ""anyone can see the number of transactions on the network"".

That's it, it's simple. You accumulate now and through this whole bear market into projects that are sure to be here in the next 3-5 years, be patient and wait for the next bull cycle. It absolutely doesn't matter if the bottom is in or not, we have another 2 years of fantastic accumulation, don't miss out because you're trying to time the bottom, it never works out

On a technical analysis side of things we are currently hanging out around the 200 week ma, this historically is the absolute best time to accumulate crypto

Don't let these shills and scam artists on youtube make you capitulate because they're telling you that the big crash hasn't happened yet. These same people were shilling absolute shitcoins in the bull market and dumping on there followers, now they're influencing you to sell when we at the 200 week moving average which is historically the best time to buy? 

I'm making this post as I feel the space can get really loud in bear markets and it can influence the common crypto investor into selling there bags trying to time the next big sell off or bottom that may never come. Scroll out, we at the 200 week ma, just ignore the noise all the fud and DCA.

 take advantage of this time. Don't be stupid with your money and buy shitcoins or leverage trade, just buy solid projects and hold for a few years. Remember this volatility is the price you have to pay for those mega gains

wqnwc7,Kushal_dodwani,5,https://redd.it/wqnwc7,‚å® Discussion,Using the power of compounding while investing in Bitcoin," Recently I came across this new strategy called Crypto SIP (For users in India) and this is the information that I gathered about this strategy.  The price mentioned in this is only for example purposes.

Given all the available avenues for crypto investments, people often overlook a simple and effective way to earn better returns‚Äì a¬†[Crypto SIPs](https://blog.coindcx.com/product-features/crypto-investment-plan-cip/)(CIP).

Unlike other investment strategies, CIPs allows you to earn potential compound returns and work towards gradual wealth creation. Here‚Äôs how CIPs are structured:

* You assign a specific amount to be invested at designated intervals. For example, 2000 INR  into Bitcoin (BTC) every week.
* Depending on the price of BTC on a particular week, the assigned amount buys up whatever it can. One week it can be 0.5 BTC if the price is 4000 INR and next it can be 2 BTC if the price is 1000 INR
* Over time, the average expenditure will be lower when compared to the portfolio gain since you buy more when the price is down and less when the price is high.

So, when regular investments are made at designated periods, returns accumulate much faster and lead to compounded portfolio growth. A better way to explain this would be using the ""Defiadda calculator"" for BTC investment:

* Investment Amount: 2000 INR
* Investment Frequency: Monthly
* Investment Period: 3 years
* No. of Investments: 36 
* Total Invested Amount: 72,000 INR
* Portfolio Valuation after 3 years: 1,73,079 INR

Using the returns you can continue to grow your portfolios. For instance, you can put investment returns into your crypto wallet. That amount becomes the balance for more regular investments. 

I would love to know what you think about this new strategy. Let me know in the comment section.",0,btc,2022-08-17 12:37:03

So to answer the question in the title of this article, I would say that technically I have quit Bitcoin Cash, and I did it at least ten months ago, just before SmmartBCH had its issue with the centralized bridge operated by CoinFlex. And I will add that my decision to move on to other projects is because I want to experience and practice on different networks and that experimenting didn't go according to plan, and now I am forced to prolong my stay. But eventually, I will move on and tell you about it once I have a new adventure.

Read the full article by following the Twitter link.

Ethereum has been in the spotlight lately because they are going to change from proof of work to a proof of stake (PoS) algorithm, developers are getting things ready, and they are supposed to make the change around Sept. 15, 2022, if everything goes according to plan. The hope for this change is that transaction costs on the network get cheaper, that DeFi tools continue to develop in the PoS chain and that users continue to flock to the ETH network so that holders benefit from transaction fees and the utility the network may provide. But not everything is perfect in this world, and at times, you must read the fine print to find the details.

Bitcoin Cash could have the same opportunity once high transaction fees show their ugly face in the future, on-chain transactions go beyond $50, and the LN reserve fee becomes unbearable by any regular user that doesn't have at least 0.03 in liquidity.

ww10lt,wtfCraigwtf,9,https://redd.it/ww10lt,None,Ruminations on ETH Proof of Stake fork (possibly offtopic),"So I've been catching up on ETH's London hard fork and the state of their transition from Proof of Work to Proof of Stake. The debate between those two methods of maintaining consensus, decentralization, and censorship resistance has been done to death, so I won't rehash that here. However, in light of the US government's recent spazzout on the Tornado Cash smart contract, the security of ETH PoS fork is looking grim. Large entities are staking billions worth of ETH in anticipation of the PoS fork, and most of those large entities are known. Since there are hardly any anonymous validators, those nodes will be vulnerable to government mandates. Vitalik asked on Twitter how many validators would comply with government blacklist demands, and 66% of validators said they would comply!

ETH is already known for blacklisting coins, the current chain rolled back the DAO hack transactions in 2018. Everywhere now I see ETH address blacklists for Scam ICOs, hacked and stolen ETH, and various other nefarious transactions. Obviously it's good that scammers got stopped, but this is showing that ETH is not censorship resistant. Vitalik and the ETH devs have the power to block transactions, and the fact that ANY person has this power means that ETH cannot be trusted. Proof of stake blacklisting by validator nodes will officially make the ability to censor part of the ETH ecosystem. Vitalik is pissed about this, and he even says ""validators who censor transactions should have their stake burned"", but that may not make a difference. Unless Vitalik really does have benevolent dictator power...

wy0gqb,oscar_salas93,75,https://redd.it/wy0gqb,üçø Drama,Main reasons why I am leaving Bitcoin Cash (A general and final response to my previous post complaining about getting banned).,"I felt the responsibility of doing this post to clear a couple of things. 

Main things I want to straight up clear:

* **I don't think** r/btc **is doing censorship. I've heard of some people complaining about it; however, in general terms, I think this subreddit allows a decent amount of freedom.** 
* **I don't have anything against the core BCH team; I actually supported them during the fork (BCHN) and have been working with them on various projects related to Bitcoin Cash over time.** 

As you may know, I am Oscar, and I used to be a Venezuelan BCHer, which means my favorite coin was BCH in terms of usage during (mostly) 2017-2019/20. However, just to keep things as clear as possible, I was never over-invested in BCH; I always held a portfolio with percentages of different main coins (BTC/ETH/AVAX... etc) because I always had the mindset not to lay all eggs in one basket. **So no, this is not about price action at all.** If that were the case, I would have left long ago.

***So why are you leaving BCH?***

**I will start talking about the least important** but last event that happened that made me decide to go off from this project finally.

I got banned from an official sBCH channel for pointing out my opinion on a subject (Basically calling sBCH a dead chain which is an objective truth). And by the time I posted my opinion, I was getting attacked by four users, finally leading to my ban for no practical reasons and just subjective reasoning. This was disappointing because Bitcoin Cash was a coin that had strong ""community"" values against censorship in general. I want to clear up that being banned on sBCH for me is practically being banned from a main BCH channel, even if it is an L2 discussion channel. ***Why?*** Because many of the people asking for the ban and the mods themselves (or part of them) have too much influence among the general BCH community and will probably gain more over time, even if they don't manage to fix the messy sBCH project.

For me, this was the last thing I was going to endure with Bitcoin Cash. 

**The other reasons:**

* **Lack of investment in marketing and proper branding.** A lot of people might see this as a non-important point, but marketing and branding are main things to care about, especially if you are trying to reach the general public. The only project that actually did a little about this was [Bitcoin.com,](https://Bitcoin.com) for obvious reasons. Aside from that, just a few projects really cared to give a good image and a proper user interface for their users. 
* **Too many forks.** BCH proved that crypto might end up forking itself into infinity. And even if BCH probably won't have more forks now (hopefully), it already forked its mcap x3. This doesn't fit good for small/big investors as they might be scared to buy a coin that could potentially fork in the future.
* **Adoption of BCH might look ""fine"" with the pro-BCH island city, but in reality, is not looking good anywhere else.** This comes from someone who had three major projects in Venezuela to promote BCH. The first one was a platform to allow people to exchange BCH for fiat (InstaBitcoin), the second was a website to look for jobs which I took the role of CEO and made it what it was today (CoinGigs), and finally, I was running events and talks in my city onboarding merchants around the city. For reference: [https://news.bitcoin.com/over-200-venezuelan-taxis-discover-the-benefits-of-bitcoin-cash/](https://news.bitcoin.com/over-200-venezuelan-taxis-discover-the-benefits-of-bitcoin-cash/)  
However, in Venezuela and many other countries (first-hand data I got), BCH adoption is lacking. All those merchants that used to accept BCH only did it for a short-term benefit (getting paid by the BCH users going for the meetups) or directly getting some people to pay the merchants to place stickers and try to accept BCH as payment.   
Sadly, today most of the merchants have already left BCH as a payment method and are using Binance P2P platforms to do payments (which basically works similarly to Zelle). All people in Venezuela are accepting crypto through Binance and no on-chain txs. In Binance, they could change it instantly for USDT, or the user could swap their cryptos to USDT in order to pay. With the Binance method, merchants basically remove the hassle of holding assets/coins that change the price every minute. For the merchants, it was a matter of weeks or months before removing the BCH stickers due to: **Lack of users paying daily, volatility, and a non-friendly user interface and experience to trade BCH into fiat.** In Venezuela, I tried to fix that with InstaBitcoin (and did fix it for a while until we ran out of liquidity).  
TLDR: **Binance/L2s won the adoption war. Bitcoin Cash probably won't get used because of its over-complicated user interface and user experience for avg Joe.**
* **As Vitalik said, decentralization is not absolute, it's a matter of degrees.** In this aspect, we could honestly say Bitcoin (BTC) is winning because it has the bigger amount of hash backing it up against attacks. However, if we consider developer(s) control over the protocol (even if that power isn't absolute), it replicates into all the other cryptos.   
In short, BCH, BTC, ETH, and most (if not all) cryptos have a major development team or a major node developer. The node developer with the biggest amount of miners and exchange supporting it will win and will take power to decide what's going to be the next update. There's no such thing as democracy or not even a fair system of changes here, it's just war to see who can convince the real players to get the support needed. Today Blockstream controls BTC, BCHN controls BCH, and Viltalik controls ETH, and all three could change (for example, just like BCHABC did get replaced), but the resources to do the replacement are only possible with the right connections. Is not something anyone can do, and BCH got lucky at this point to have all the necessary influence to prevent ABC from keeping control over the protocol. In another case, where people with a lack of resources wanted to take control of the node for honest and good reasons, it would have failed completely, leading to a minority fork.
* **Market conditions for BCH are at the worst stage ever.** This only partially affected me even if, at some point, I generated a profit (especially with the last recent pump). However, the constant price downfall is one of the main reasons why BCH won't get adopted compared to BTC or ETH long term. Investors and business owners aren't interested in holding a coin that will go down in price constantly, and sadly, in this case, it's not particularly because of random market conditions; it's because of BCH's own fault. **To be specific: Constant forks, public figures that used to support BCH betraying it, CoinFlex rug pull due to unprofessional company management and corruption, plus lack of incentives to actually use and hold BCH (and everything said before adds up to this point).** 
* **Darknet and deep web: There's no BCH adoption there.** This point should be self-explanatory, but the fact people don't use BCH to buy stuff on the darknet and deep web and rather use BTC and Monero is a big red flag. If we expect people to find BCH utility, the first group of users that should be adopting it are those markets. However, there's no market from what I was informed and checked myself that actually used BCH as a payment method. This, for me, is the biggest red flag, as the people that should care about this product **don't care because, for them, there are better options.** Could be price action? Or could be non-anonymous txs? Heck, even ETH is used there, and people rather mix those coins with Tornado. Bitcoin Cash fusions aren't getting positive metrics from what I know, so from both sides, BCH is not a compelling product. **Maybe fees aren't everything in this adoption equation.** 
* **The EVM experiment is dead.** And some people might not agree with me, but let me give you a short story: I have experience with EVMs, and I worked with projects on AVAX, sBCH, SOL, and ETH. From the EVM perspective, and in general, terms, having a chain with no backup at all is a tremendous warning itself. But the fact the peg hasn't been fixed for over 2 months is incredibly insane. So yes, don't expect sBCH to survive this without starting from 0, trying to regain the trust that won't come back thanks to CoinFlex. The EVM experiment is dead and won't come back. I am not being pessimistic, if you believe otherwise, you are being over-positive, and I would sadly tell you to stop the religious following on these groups/scammers that rug pulled you. 
* **Main BCH figures get tainted every time, the last one: Roger and Mark Lamb (+ many of those people that got thousands of dollars from Flipstarter and never finished anything).** And yes, people will probably be kicking Roger over the next few months if Mark is right about his lawsuit. Which is a potential truth at this point (and no, this doesn't mean Mark is good, Mark is a corrupt scum no matter the outcome). About the Flipstarter part, we could safely say we were wrong about the investment method; **Flipstarter wasn't a good way to give money because it gave no responsibility to the project owners. And yes, to be transparent, I ran a Flipstarter in the name of CoinGigs, which was successful, and also completed all the promises listed in the donation window.**   
***Note: I left CoinGigs and gave all the power to its previous owner, and since that, the project has been completely abandoned and unused with no updates at all. I did my job, upgraded it, and left (modern user interface, side-shift integration/multi-coin usage, marketing with low-budget and much more).***
* **Many of the OGs left, and after the CF drama, probably all of them.** 

And that's it. Those are the reasons why I am out. I hope you know to understand why the ban was the last punch for me. 

For a positive endpoint, I want to say that **I think BCH is still a good project with a good heart, but sadly it's not going well and most likely won't grow more from this because of all the points I mentioned before. And they'll probably repeat in the future. The BCH community betrayed itself when it gave all the power to such an important product (sBCH) to a DEX (CoinFlex).**

wy67gl,ShortSqueeze20k,32,https://redd.it/wy67gl,ü§î Opinion,Main reasons why I am NOT leaving Bitcoin Cash,"""SOMEONE should post a pro BCH thread so others can see the other side of the story"" -me before making this post. 

First, the most important distinction to understand is PRICE vs VALUE.

**Price** is the amount paid for acquiring any product or service.

**Value** is the utility of a good or service for a customer.

We as Bitcoin Cash supporters know the **value** of BCH, non supporters only know the **price** of BCH. Accumulating when price < value is ideal. When price = value you can still accumulate, but the largest portion of gains come from accumulating when price < value. When price > value take profits. 

It is my belief BCH is significantly in the price < value category. Here are some reasons why.

1) Developer happiness: For the first few years after the BTC/BCH split there were very public disagreements between developers and stakeholders resulting in 2 internal splits. Compared to back then, developer happiness is much higher today. I've heard a few devs mention this. There are public discussions happening in various places (https://bitcoincashresearch.org/, twitter live chats, youtube network discussions, telegram cashtokens) and the tone is productive, actual collaboration is happening. Compared to Amaury rage quitting a live video discussion and Craig Wright's ""you split, we bankrupt you"", the atmosphere today is basically the opposite of the past. BCH supporters understand the heartaches BCH has been through and how it is different today, but no way the haters on social media know this. Has the increase in BCH's value from developer happiness been priced in yet?

2) Actual improvements to layer 1 are happening: For the first few years after the BTC/BCH split, hardfork upgrades were about fixing issues rather than improving BCH. BCH spent years fixing the difficulty algorithm to get block issuance to reliably be 1 block per 10 min on average. Remember when huge amounts of hash switched between BCH and BTC and BCH was finding a block every minute? A new address format to help with coins sent to the wrong address? Unrecoverable segwit address fix? Replay protection? These changes were needed but they were fixes, not improvements. Compare those past fixes to recent and upcoming improvements to BCH like: Removing the unconfirmed transaction limit, 64 bit math vs BTC's 32 bit math, native introspection, double spend proofs, native tokens, joint-execution decentralized exchange. These are actual improvements to BCH's value that only people who don't ignore BCH updates know about. Have these been priced in yet?

3) Bitcoin Cash actually works as marketed: Bitcoin Cash is peer to peer electronic cash for the world. It promises to be basically free, basically instant, reliable, and uncensorable AND IT ACTUALLY IS. Even through all BCH's troubles it still works as intended. We all know about BTC's fee problems but the majority of other coins have also promised basically free/cheap transactions and have been unable to deliver. I won't get into it here, but this scalability issue has a lot to do with BCH being a UTXO model rather than an account model (like ETH). When's the last time you heard someone talk about scaling issues between UTXO and account models? They only talk about scaling account models without knowing UTXO scales much better. The problem here for BCH is that adoption has been low and transactions per day has been falling so the scalability of BCH is currently hidden, for now.

4) Bitcoin Cash is still seen as a different class of cryptocurrency by regulators. Recently Canadian crypto exchanges imposed a 30k CAD annual limit for cryptocurrencies. These new rules do not apply to BTC, ETH, BCH, LTC. [source](https://www.cryptotimes.io/canadian-crypto-exchanges-impose-30k-cad-annual-limit-for-altcoins/). Companies too [paypal?](https://newsroom.paypal-corp.com/2022-06-07-PayPal-Users-Can-Now-Transfer-Send-and-Receive-Bitcoin-Ethereum-Bitcoin-Cash-and-Litecoin#:~:text=We%20are%20thrilled%20to%20announce,of%20crypto%20on%20our%20platform.).

5) Coinflex. The Coinflex drama caught me off guard, totally didn't see it coming. Putting the drama around Coinflex aside if we are to believe the current information provided then a massive amount of BCH were sold that were intended to be 'long', increasing sell side liquidity temporarily. In addition there is a lot of FUD around the situation as many BCH supporters lost a lot. **Yes the Coinflex situation is bad but the situation is mostly reflected in the price of BCH, not the value of BCH.** SmartBCH still exists and a reasonable person should see it has potential. BCH isn't betting everything on SmartBCH and BCH is decentralized so they can build on BCH if they want. 

6) St. Maarten cryptocurrency legal tender regulation. While this regulation is for all cryptocurrencies, BCH supporters know St. Maarten is a hotspot for BCH adoption. The St. Maarten parliament member (MP Brison) pushing the regulation joined a few BCH live discussions and gave various examples of why he supports BCH. He really gets it. He even mentioned his intention to give BCH supporters a first look during the November BCH conference in St. Maarten.

&#x200B;

I saw the other thread where the creator of flipstarter has one for himself, and really liked the way flipstarter works in general. 

&#x200B;

I created a flipstarter for our own employees for crypto for the homeless as a result!

&#x200B;

One thing you may not know is that we have many employees - all working completely without pay. We all enjoy/love the project to death and work on it because it is a passion project and something to call our own. I pledged from the very beginning that none of the funds would be used for ANYTHING other than food/goods for the homeless - and I intend to keep it that way for good. However, we've had many people suggest to us that we should at least create new wallets meant for the employees, so that if any supporters did want to support them - there was a way. That is the purpose of this flipstarter. Completely not required for us to operate since we have zero costs/overhead - however I think the employees do deserve at least meager support for the massive amount of time that they've put in, and will continue to put in!

My point is this - if BCH is about increasing adoption and creating a 'circular economy', shouldn't setting up a non-custodial, PayPal style BCH donation button be an easy thing to do by now?

I'm relatively tech savvy so I can set up a simple Wordpress site but finding a way to set up a seamless bch payment processor which actually lets you log the payments and maybe take reference info etc, is... not forthcoming.

The best option I've seen is [prompt.cash](https://prompt.cash) but it's not obvious to me how I can set up a payment gateway where the user sets the amount themselves (i.e. make a donation). All the options seem to be for fixed amounts i.e. for an e-commerce website.

There's also [paybutton.org](https://paybutton.org) where you can set up a donate button easily but there's no way to log the payments or get any email notifications when a payment is made etc...

x2jecv,Fun_Assistance_1696,13,https://redd.it/x2jecv,üêª Bearish,Do you think BTC will surivive after CBDC is here?,"I don't think so. BTC is meant to be a currency but so is CBDC. So it comes down to which one is better as a currency and that's CBDC.

CBDC is better because it has the same level privacy which FIAT has.... which is terrible privacy but it's infinitely better than no privacy at all which is the problem with BTC. 

If you get your salary paid in BTC, then your boss will know which one's your address and will be able to know ALL your addresses, it does't matter if you send to another wallet, your boss will know all wallets that belong to you. 

And the tools for analyzing the public ledgers are going to become more advanced and user friendly later, so your boss will likely not even need you to give your address, he'll just be able to look you up, typing your name into some public database and get all your wallets.

So what happens if you go to Vegas for a weekend and visit a strip club. Then you get fired from your job because it's visible in the blockchain.

It's not just your boss, it's also anyone can look you up. They can see all your savings, how much money you have, what you're doing with them. Your friends will know all about the sex toys you buy, your mom will complain on all the beer you buy, and your neighbor might get worried about why you're seeing a psychiatrist so often and I think we will all have to see a psychiatrist when we realize that WEF won the war against crypto currencies.

I just don't think most people will be ok with that extreme privacy issues BTC is going to have when/if businesses start accepting BTC.

That's why everyone will want to use CBDC as their currency.

And that's just one of the many problems which crypto have against CBDC. Those corrupt politicians can do anything, higher taxes for those who use BTC instead of CBDC for example. And no one wants a highly volatile currency like BTC anyway. 

BTC is going to just be for investing, but the whole selling point of BTC is gone when CBDC comes, so it might not make any point to invest in BTC any more.

Goverment will have direct full control of CBDC and indirect full control of BTC (and other cryptos like ETH as well). It's only privacy coins like Monero which can resist their control. BUT Monero will also be useless because yes it's a great currency that can't be stopped, we can use it to send money anonymously but no businesses will accept Monero if/when it's illegal and it's already illegal in a few countries.

This whole BTC is a decentralized resistance against oppressive governments, it's freedom money bla bla is all bs. BTC can't resist anything.

Mixers will get sanctioned as well. Tornado Cash already was and the dev was arrested.

WEF and CBDC have basically already won. They are just one move away from check mate. You will own nothing and you'll be happy! Crypto lost and we're going back to slavery. Please change my mind if you can.",0,btc,2022-08-31 17:28:38

Today, I‚Äôm not only proud showing off Bitcoin Cash‚Äôs (or Bitcoin as it should have always been) transaction fees, but also:

-	Native OP codes which enable unprecedented non-account-based smart contracts and oracles

-	Cash Fusion and the true enabling of cash-like fungibility

-	SmartBCH (even though I still dislike its current centralized topology) and what it enables and empowers creators in issuing their own SmartContracts and tokens: My barber is planning to expand his shop by issuing a SmartBCH token and then offer the holders a part of his future revenues!

-	Flipstarter and the decentralized nature of fund raising. We saw first hand how the bank accounts and fund raising efforts of the Canadian mandates protestors were frozen. FlipStarter forever changes this.

-	The multitude of Decentralized exchanges  available for SmartBCH and BCH - From the amazing indexers which allow you to trade across all these exchanges to the amazing Pok√©mon game and lottery on BenSwap. The creativity is endless.

-	BCH.Games and the other amazing casinos and lotteries leveraging the insanely fast 0-confirmation transactions and the eventual near-free on-chain transaction. Absolutely ground breaking applications of an otherwise a very straightforward working-Bitcoin implementation.

-	AnyHedge and the amazing applications of native oracles and on-chain contracts enforcing externally-determined outcomes. This will literally redefine industry standards when it comes to options, futures and other derivatives trading. 

-	True Decentralization: Decentralization of mining clients, Decentralization of development teams, Decentralization of mining, Decentralization of Development Roadmaps (CHIPs), Decentralization of everything. Every other coin fails this test, and this is how BTC was captured and throttled by a company who then sold their solution (Liquid) to a problem which otherwise wouldn‚Äôt exist had this team hadn‚Äôt centralized decision making around themselves.

-	Censorship resistance on the community and ideology level: Every Bitcoin Cash participant and community member actively resists censorship and advocates for dialogue. From rBTC to Read(dot)Cash to memo(dot)cash to Twitter spaces: All non-trolling opinions are welcomed and all constructive discussions and criticisms are welcomed. 

-	Decentralized Payment Processors such as Prompt(Dot)Cash and others. Absolutely phenomenal in merchant on-boarding and in allowing conventional commerce an easy on-ramp to the peer to peer electronic cash universe.

-	True resistance to any take-over attempts driven by a mature understanding of the Bitcoin Peer to Peer electronic cash use case: Teams were kicked out when they tried to fork segwit into the code (BTC) in order to sell off-chain rent-seeking solutions , then again when they tried to copyright Bitcoin (BSV), and yet again when they tried to tax Bitcoin (ABC/XEC), and it will reliably happen over and over again thanks to Bitcoin‚Äôs built-in game theory incentives and equilibrium.

-	Amazing Protocol-level development and on-chain scaling research: From the amazing work General Protocols do in creating native development frameworks and protocols, to the amazing scaling work by people such as Andrew Stone (XThinner) and Peter Rizun. 

-	Amazing on-chain unstoppable tools: From decentralized voting with voter(dot)cash to Cash IDs

-	And the list goes on and on.

just like there are risks to losing your money if its cash under a mattress lost to a fire regular users also have to deal with potentially losing a lot of money if they send to the wrong address, lose access to their device, or something else happens. 

are there any options out there for custodianship as a service? ideally with features such as some combination of

1. the owner has the ability to withdraw their funds without permission of the custodian(maybe some strategy that includes the owner holding the wallet recovery phrase?)

2. a streamlined process to have your savings with the custodian while easily being able to move spending money to your phone whenever you want

3. an option to prevent your funds from being used in fractional reserve banking and pay a fee for custodian services

this is just brainstorming though. i know its ironic looking for a good custodian service and on the other hand telling users ""not your keys not your coins"" when they get lost on an exchange, but hopefully there are services out there that can mitigate risks associated with holding the keys yourself without completely losing control of the money",6,btc,2022-09-04 19:56:55

I blame myself but I really wanted this project to work and wanted to support its developers.

The BIGGEST single blow came from the $20,000 I put into sBUSD. A user in this form was the creator of this ""stable"" token and used this message board FOR MONTHS to shill his token saying it was, ""The most stable,"" and ""The safest pair \[sBUSD/wBCH\] on SmartBCH."" Of course these were lies he used to push his token onto this community.

For a long time I thought maybe this user was good intentioned but perhaps a little inept, but those hopes were dashed when I learned the true nature of what he had done. The ""scam"" was that he sold his stable coin (sBUSD) as ""the most stable"" because all he needed was incoming funds he could hold on to, he then used his users funds to buy a different extremely high yielding token and kept the APR income for himself, earning 10-25% APR on his users money that he then withdrew and kept for himself. When the underlying scam his scam was depending on fell apart he ducked and ran, offering to ""buy back"" 5% of his users sBUSD for only 50% of its face value (at least that was the deal he offered me, that, ""or nothing"").

I later learned that he had managed to take out at least $300,000 of users' funds he kept, ""for me and my family I now need to care for..."". IF this user had ANY intention of even trying to pay back his customers he would have asked users to get in touch who wanted to ""cash out"". For ONLY $200,000 he could make all of his users whole again \[1\], but of course he doesn't want to even talk about this because he doesn't care, he was never even going to try and make people whole. In short he has more than enough money to pay back his users FROM PROFIT OF THE TOKEN, but he chooses not to.

x847vl,TinosNitso,10,https://redd.it/x847vl,None,"Formula to calculate half-life of BCH Hedge, paying monthly txn fees + interest rate (Hedge rate), incl. Python code. $10 halves in 27 years, paying 0.2%/month.","`HalfLife = log((A‚ÇÄ/2+Fee/r)/(A‚ÇÄ+Fee/r))/log(1-r)/12`

`An = (A‚ÇÄ+Fee/r)(1-r)^(12n)-Fee/r`

    from math import log
    def HalfLife(A0,Fee,r): return log((A0/2+Fee/r)/(A0+Fee/r))/log(1-r)/12
    def An(A0,Fee,r,n): return (A0+Fee/r)*(1-r)**(12*n)-Fee/r

where `A‚ÇÄ` is initial Amount ($ or BCH), `Fee` is the total txn fees per month, `r` is the decimal monthly interest rate, & `An` is the amount after `n` years.

[Here](https://www.blockchain.com/bch/address/pz23yseh358gcjqjwafxu75umemmnprf2yjf2e8rp7) is an AnyHedge Contract address whose history consists of making & exiting a Hedge. It's under 1kB, so `Fee` is **0.11** cents if that's all which is required every month. Some months may require multiple Hedges though if a stop-loss is triggered (protection against faulty price or scam oracles).

But what rate `r`? Assuming Bitcoin Cash being used as a BTC Cash payment system achieves the lowest possible rate, maybe 0.2%/month (`r=.002`). That's 2.4% p.a. to cover the BCH Bulls' trading expenses. A Bull could sell half his BCH for BTC & go 2x long on the other half, earning 2.4% p.a. yield. But maybe people Hedge en masse if BCH/BTC is obviously about to go down. Every market-take requires paying a spread, btwn bid & ask, & so 2.4% p.a. may not be sufficient. Maybe 0.5%/month is more realistic, & it's variable. Above 2%/month is considered usury, unless it's a Hedge-rate.

Speaking of $ is a little misleading, but what could be most popular is a BCH Hedge to BTC (**S**tore-**o**f-**V**alue) using $ as the Unit-of-Account! The wallet value does whatever BTC's price does, but we count it in $, even though it's all on BCH's blockchain. BCH can be thought of as a **H**edge-**t**o-**V**alue, the **V**alue **H**edged **t**o everything else.

What is a reasonable amount? $1, **$10** & $100 have half-lifes 16, **27** & 29 years. So $10 is a reasonable Hedge, but $1 isn't necessarily enough to cover the 0.11c fees. However if BCH price went up (e.g. 10x) the minimum amount would 10x too. To calculate in Electron Cash console:

    HalfLife(1,.0011,.002)
    HalfLife(10,.0011,.002)
    HalfLife(100,.0011,.002)

To check the $10 half-life, enter

    An(10,.0011,.002,26.7)

Unfortunately BCH currently doesn't support Hedging with variable maturity, imho. I've been [discussing](https://bitcoincashresearch.org/t/op-get-current-block-height/533/8?u=tinos) the issue over at BitcoinCashResearch. A new OpCode, `OP_CHECKBLOCKHEIGHTVERIFY` (with 6-conf lock, OP\_CBHV) would guarantee Hedge can Exit whenever they want without Bull's signature.

I doubt AnyHedge will achieve mass-adoption without a new OpCode. If BCH could enable grocery & fuel money to be Hedged to BTC (or XAU, etc) then maybe. However without OP\_CBHV a smartphone would have to keep re-Hedging every few hrs & the person has to predict a few hrs in advance to disable the auto-re-Hedge. Also, a multisig escrow is inconvenient because escrow+vendor have to keep signing each re-Hedge since a shipment could take any amount of time. We can't write a BCH Script which determines the block-height of the blockchain without a new OpCode. AnyHedge might still work if the Bulls are always online to **auto-sign** the Hedge-Exit (to pay for groceries instantly, etc). Like a LightNing channel, a trusted counterparty should be required.

Instead of the BCHN full node wallet Hedging to BTC the way it should, CashTokens could enable it to hodl some official BTC CashToken (yield bearing?). The wallet isn't necessarily valid if its value isn't linked to BTC. That's if it's mining Bitcoin, using the same PoW. It deserves Bitcoin's actual value.

If Satoshi wanted to fork his own chain, surely he'd Hedge the new full node wallet to BTC. His whitepaper seems consistent with Bitcoin being both a **S**tore-**o**f-**V**alue & a **H**edge-**t**o-**V**alue. BCH can enable Bitcoin's true value to be spread to the masses in a decentralized way. It's an alternative to the LightningNetwork which may be cheaper if the Hedge rate is low enough. Only BCH/BTC price oracle/s would be needed by the nodes.

An analogy is if a USD balance at PayPal were only ever representative of PYPL shares, + Hedge to USD. If PYPL goes down, more shares are owed, with final settlement in PYPL - sold at the stock exchange. It'd be a way for PayPal to avoid banking directly - the stock brokers handle that. But there could be a monthly rate paid to the PYPL Bull. üòâ",4,btc,2022-09-07 12:45:49

This is pennies. BCH is scarce AF. People will react to the supply scarcity when its too late.,"total BCH blocks per day: 144

currently 	6.25 BCH reward per block, totals 328,500 new BCH that can be purchased/mined per year until April 2024. That totals only $32 million dollars at a $100 price per BCH.

After April 2024 halving there will be 3.125 BCH per block, totaling: 164,250 BCH per year for 4 years. Which at $100 is only $16 million per year of new USD that can be purchased/mined.

These numbers are so cheap, that even one wealthy individual could afford to simply buy up every BCH ever mined.

xcmrvm,wtfCraigwtf,25,https://redd.it/xcmrvm,‚å® Discussion,Thought Experiment: Consequences of a Government ban on Proof of Work Mining,"There have been rumblings about banning proof of work mining for years. Just today we see [another policy paper](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/09-2022-Crypto-Assets-and-Climate-Report.pdf) from the White House Office of Science and Technology proposing a PoW ban. A PoW ban would have immediate and drastic effects on crypto mining in the USA. Much of the world's mining farms moved from China to the USA after China banned mining. In the event of a mining ban, large crypto mining farms in the US would suffer huge losses, and would likely go bankrupt. Smaller miners would go underground and try to spread out their power consumption to avoid detection. Mining pools would relocate to bulletproof jurisdictions to avoid doxxing their clients or getting taken offline. Node operators might even implement measures to avoid takedowns and surveillance. 

However, on the whole, a mining ban could be GOOD for crypto. It would decentralize mining much more, and cull the herd to those willing to risk prosecution to sustain the network. Hashrate would drop massively, and difficulty would adjust, resulting in a tremendous increase in mining efficiency. Power utilization would be cut 100x or more. Pool use would increase dramatically to shelter miner IPs and location.  Countermeasures against government shutdown such as protocol encryption (isn't it shocking that BTC P2P traffic is still not encrypted?), obfuscation, and port randomization would rapidly deploy, and crypto P2P networks as a whole would become more robust. Price of coins would drop quickly as people rushed for the exits, but cost of mining would also decrease rapidly.

Is BitcoinCash Price Manipulated by Miners?

If comparing BTC hash rate 234E-BCH 1.2E -> 195%

and BTC price $2000-BCH $118 --> 169%

You will find it almost the same ratio.

It shows that.

Miners only need to maintain a small hash rate on the BCH network to be profitable.

They do not need to increase hash power on the BCH network, but still have a mining advantage.

&#x200B;

Therefore, every time the price of BCH increases,

BCH miners will mine more, and immediately sell to the market.

That can give them higher profits.

The kicker is, this wallet has already sent a transaction via BTC, so the public key is exposed on the BTC block chain already.

I filled out [btc.com](https://btc.com)'s google form, but from what I can tell, that service is no longer active, and the ability to redeem these coins was removed and added back again in 2019, and I assume still active?

It's just my humble opinion that he was a young, intelligent guy who happened to misjudge the risks & consequences for making some incredibly foolish decisions. Making foolish decisions doesn't make you a criminal -- it makes you human:

If you have any other thoughts, please share!

&#x200B;

1. The BItcoin Cash Community is exactly part of the forked Bitcoin Community.

They are good people, they know exactly what it takes for a coin to succeed.

\--> That is very lacking in the projects out there.

&#x200B;

2. Ecosystem.

The vision of Bitcoin Cash is centralized and p2p transactions.

In recent years, merchants are increasing the number of people accepting Bitcoin Cash.

However, the price drop is a concern for traders.

&#x200B;

3. Technology:

Bitcoin Cash has changed a lot from the corner version.

Good thing I see, it needs to change to adapt.

Example: 0-Confin, Algorithm Hash Difficulty Moderation

&#x200B;

4. Regulation and support for big players.

Major US retail bank allows customers to deposit BitcoinCash. Paypal..... Accepts Bitcoin Cash.

Canada allows citizens to buy Bitcoin Cash without limits.

\-> This is exactly the platform to help Bitcoin Cash scale as needed.

Everything is available, just waiting for Network Effects.

&#x200B;

5. Most importantly, the price is very low.

Low prices are the driving force for the sharks to gather and raise prices.

\--> I do not support this view, but it is the current fact.

It should also be seen as crucial to driving Bitcoin Cash's price increase in the future.

Let's look back at the history when Bitcoin Cash price was $74 (when Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin SV split). Everything is uncertain.

But then the price went up to $1650",12,btc,2022-09-20 00:54:50

xjmg9h,Apprehensive_Net_387,45,https://redd.it/xjmg9h,‚ùóWOW,Bitcoin Jason (guy behind u/BitcoinCashCity) deeply involved in fraudulent scheme that sole $722M USD from investors,"Earlier I was browsing the website for the [Bitcoin Cash 2022 Conference](https://bch-22.com/#about) in Saint Kitts + doing some background research on the various speakers and I have to say, it looks to be a great line-up! Unfortunately I stumbled across some questionable things relating to the speaker who goes by the name Bitcoin Jason and I think it's in the best interest of the community to know who we are associating with and allowing to represent Bitcoin Cash on the world stage. Jason is behind the account u/BitcoinCashCity that has been responsible for merchant onboardings in **the city of Townsville** (insert Power Puff Girls meme here). This seems harmless enough but he only came onto the scene recently and I was curious about what he was doing before all this. 

A Google search for Bitcoin Jason lead me to his [LinkedIn page](https://imgur.com/a/GHkbSnt) (unable to archive but I took a screenshot) where I learned that his real name is Jason Vause. This is where I really started going down the rabbit hole. Googling Jason Vause took me to one of his Twitter accounts and it was here that I discovered he was a [promoter of Bitclub](https://archive.ph/yfNOo). For those of you who don't know, Bitclub was a notorious crypto ponzi scheme that defrauded investors of [over $722 Million USD](https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2022/03/24/former-cpa-pleads-guilty-to-helping-bitclub-architect-launder-funds-in-722m-ponzi-scheme/). Many of the ring leaders and promoters of this fraud, that destroyed the lives of countless innocents, are thankfully now in prison. Anyway, in the [Instagram post](https://archive.ph/XaXKv) he linked to you can see that he shared a website called www.bitclubnetworkaustralia.com. This URL is dead but again I Googled 'Bitclub Network Australia' and I found both a [live website](https://archive.ph/c0x6S), which still appears to be soliciting investments from unsuspecting victims, and it's associated [YouTube channel](https://archive.ph/DGxwV). Straight away you will see Bitcoin Jason's face appearing on one of the video's thumbnails. The content of these videos is nothing damning, they are just tutorials for some crypto exchanges. But if you watch [this particular video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgtrlVnaGE8) it opens with the Bitclub Network Australia logo and he says ""Jason Vause here on behalf of Bitclub Network Australia"". On [another video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6YKyq8w5lo) you will see that he is wearing a polo shirt [that bears the Bitclub logo](https://imgur.com/a/9Py6pJh). At this point Jason seems to have been deeply involved in the Australian arm of Bitclub, and dare I say appears to have been the one leading the operation as he is the only person featured in these videos. 

Further searches for ‚ÄòJason Vause‚Äô and ‚ÄòBitclub‚Äô unearthed more Twitter accounts belonging to Jason, the first being [@AussieOptions](https://web.archive.org/web/2/https://twitter.com/AussieOptions). This is clearly Jason because it is frequently posting his Bitcoin Cash City videos and there are pictures of him and links to his Instagram page. Previously this account was used to [refer victims](https://web.archive.org/web/20220919004201/https://twitter.com/search?q=%40aussieoptions%20bitclub&src=typed_query) to his Bitclub YouTube channel. The second Twitter account uses the alias [@ParkStreetBoy]( https://web.archive.org/web/20220919004558/https://twitter.com/ParkStreetBoy), which pictures Jason and he [posted frequently]( https://web.archive.org/web/20220919004705/https://twitter.com/search?q=%40ParkStreetBoy%20bitclub&src=typed_query) about Bitclub. He also has a [Tumblr page]( https://web.archive.org/web/20220919004538/https://homelesspreacher.tumblr.com/) which has a collection of Bitclub related posts. The one thing that all these social profiles have in common, is that they linked to Bitclub YouTube videos that are now removed from public view on the Bitclub Network Australia YouTube. Quite clearly, Jason has removed these to conceal his dirty past. Although he failed miserably as he left a massive evidence trail that I have now uncovered. 

From everything I outlined above, we know that Jason Vause was heavily involved in Bitclub at least between July 2017 through to December 2019 when the scheme was [shut down](https://www.justice.gov/usao-nj/bitclub) by the U.S. DOJ and they [arrested](https://coinrivet.com/cryptocurrency-rocked-by-massive-bitcoin-fraud/) some of the ring leaders. At this point it seems that Jason pivoted his focus to Bitcoin Cash, which he was exposed to and gained an interest in when [Bitclub switched from BTC to BCH](https://web.archive.org/web/20180201225141/https:/news.bitcoin.com/six-months-later-bitcoin-cash-support-continues-to-grow/). Based on Jason‚Äôs merchant onboarding skills, it would appear he‚Äôs quite the salesman. But he acquired these same skills while he was profiting off the victims which he lured into the Bitclub fraud. For that, I do not believe he should be given any respect by us or a platform at the BCH conference hosted by u/sunnyskn. BCH has already been badly impacted by thieving scammers like Craig Wright, Amaury Sechet and more recently Mark Lamb. We cannot continue exposing ourselves to this level of risk, which always ends in disaster and further damages the reputation of BCH.",57,btc,2022-09-20 22:18:44

Edit 2: I am talking about top-level posts. Expressing opinion and emotion in the comments is fine, again, assuming you're abiding by the basic rules. Pro-tip: ""In my opinion"" are three very helpful words.

Do you have actionable, concrete evidence of someone doing something wrong within the Bitcoin community? Do you want to help prevent people from being harmed by an ongoing scam? Are you able to lay out the evidence dispassionately, without breaking any Reddit ToS or rbtc rules?

Then your content is welcome in this sub.

Is this a personal issue and not something that directly affects the greater community? Is this about something that happened years ago and not an ongoing, present danger?  Do you have many claims but little evidence? Are you emotional and exaggerating? Are you going to break the rules? Should you be in a courtroom instead of a chatroom?

Your post will be removed without a warning.

Does your post kinda cross the lines from A to B? Is there anything remotely suspicious about the account that created it?

It's probably going to get removed too.

As mods we are not and cannot be responsible for litigating the facts of any dispute. This places us in a serious bind when it comes to accusations of personal wrongdoing. If we allow accusations to stand, then we may be helping the attacker to harm the other party. If we take down accusations, then we appear to be protecting the other party or complicit in a wrongdoing.

As a general rule, the anti-harassment rule comes into play. If the post appears to be primarily a public service announcement, it may be allowed to stay up. If it appears to be primarily a witch hunt, it must be removed. If it's unclear, then it must be treated as a witch hunt.

Hopefully this provides clear guidelines for any future posters with axes to grind. We don't want to be in the position of enabling scammers, but we also can't be in the position of allowing targeted harassment. If you have something to say, make sure nobody can construe it as harassment.

(similar to how Dall-E is changing the art world like how Amazon put nearly all the shopping malls in America out of business)

I have been told the following from some guy on discord and I would like to know if it is true:

> **Discord guy:** Something about how segwit makes BTC less secure

Can someone tell me what he is talking about in 2 sentences maximum? I'm not dumb enough to believe that the BTC devs would willingly and/or knowingly make their version of crypto less secure. Was the guy on discord pulling my leg or do the BCH people truly believe this? 

My next question is regarding what ""protects"" the uniqueness of BCH? What if half of the ""big names"" within the BCH community (such as Roger Ver) have a fight with the other half of the BCH community (and the dev team is split 50/50) and two new BCH chains are created? 

I'm aware of the BSV split and also the guy with a weird name's split. Amaury Sachet? I think his fork was called Bitcoin Cash ABC but my memory is horrible so don't quote me on that. 

Let's pretend that something like the BSV split happens again but it perfectly splits the BCH community 50/50 evenly rather than 80/20 (as I'm under the impression that only 20% of the ""big names"" in BCH were in favor of BSV and they took 20% of the community and eco-system with them). 

If I made any mistakes in this post in the history of BCH, please forgive me. I'm a Mormon musician with an autistic child and that is what my post history will tell you. I'm not a crypto person at all. (although I wish to become one)

I am a fan of BTC also because I really like ""bitusher"" on the bitcoin beginners forum. He is either God or an AI because he always leaves an ***extremely*** informative answer within 1 hour every time I post a question there (or several questions). However, I hate ""Theymos"" so badly that it cancels my admiration for BitUsher. 

What I like about the BCH community is they are the side of logic and reason. The BTC community (by contrast) is the side of ""muscle"" where if you say the wrong thing, they will come after you or try to ruin your reputation. I'm a Godly person and I will always support the side which has the ""moral high ground"" metaphorically speaking (which BCH currently holds):

I have a lot of questions and I am sure many in Bch community do also. Even though I am a creditor a I have not been paying  much attention to the facts of this unfortunate event. I basically wrote it off as a loss and lesson learned. But lets hash this out...

1.) Who belongs to this group of ""large creditor group"" that has done the negotiating for all creditors?

&#x200B;

2.) Who is the SmartBCH Alliance? How do we even know they can be trusted. Who made them the beneficiary of the SmartBCH share. Coinflex? 

3.) Why is Coinflex short more than what they say Roger owes? I know the reason coinflex has given is because of flex liquidations. How do I know this is true?

4.) Why was 100,000 BCH allowed to be withdrawn after withdraws were closed?

5.) Why should I trust what Mark Lamb says? It seems to me a lot of shady transfers occurred leading up to the gating of withdraws.

&#x200B;

A lot does not add up and pretty much must be taken on the word of Mark Lamb. I have have a deep feeling in my gut that something is amiss.

xqckrj,TinosNitso,3,https://redd.it/xqckrj,None,Emulating OP_BLOCKHEIGHT using OP_OUTPOINTTXHASH (or SegWit). American style contracts may be possible.,"It should be possible to emulate `OP_BLOCKHEIGHT` using `OP_OUTPOINTTXHASH`. A price Oracle could sign the price of an asset (e.g. gold), along with the block-height (or timestamp) & (shortened) **TXID of the Contract**. The initial prices can be encoded in the Contract itself. If a new block is found & the price changes by more than 0.005%, the Oracle broadcasts a change in the Contract's TXID, ideally without changing its P2SH address. The Oracle signs nothing if they can't broadcast a change in TXID, or else an old price could be used later on. This way we may not need an OpCode for block-height.

Shortening the TXID to **20B** could reduce data-usage (32B shouldn't be necessary). `<20> OP_SPLIT OP_DROP` seems sufficient (first or last 20B of TXID), but `OP_SHA1` is 3 Bytes less. Instead of repeating it 5 times to verify 5of8 data-sig-messages, it can be `OP_DUP`'d in Script.

SegWit could work in a similar way. Both counterparties predict like a hundred (or thousand) changes in the Contract's TXID, at various sat/B. SegWit can enforce a covenant by brute forcing every possibility. Then the Oracle can change the TXID predictably. There'd also be a 5-week (or 8-week) timeout-clawback which is pre-signed 2of2, following any chain of TXID changes. It's conceivable to use SegWit for Hedging, instead of OP\_CTV (`OP_CHECKTEMPLATEVERIFY`). Instead of just signing the asset price, the Oracle (e.g. mining pool) could form part of a 2of3 (or 5of8) escrow service, based on `OP_RETURN` Hedge contracts (e.g. 10x Hedge to gold, paying 2%/month on 10\*Principal, with 0.1%&0.1% Open&Close fees). Arguably the `OP_RETURN` scheme could be best, since the monthly interest rates could be lowest for BTC-Hedging, to the point where txn fees could rise dramatically if it's popular. A Coin which is a Store-of-Value ought to have the best rates. Mining pools could compete on offering Smart-Oracle escrow services if miners demand `OP_RETURN` smart contracts, to cater to Hedge Funds.

The `<M>` & `<N>` in MofN MultiSig can be blinded & kept **secret** if both counterparties cooperatively Exit. I doubt TapRoot would help.

u/bitcoincashautist [mentioned](https://bitcoincashresearch.org/t/op-get-current-block-height/533/12) there could be a clock covenant, over at BitcoinCashResearch. However the approach I'm describing doesn't necessarily involve OP\_CLTV (except for a 5-week **clawback**).

One issue with the emulation concept is it could conceivably be ""aiding & abetting money laundering"" if a well-known Smart-Oracle uses their only PubKey to repeatedly sign the price of gold along with North-Korean TXIDs. One idea is to sign a separate (clock-like) dummy Contract TXID, which may be [invoked](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/w11r7s/emulating_op_eval_using_bitcoin_cash_native/) using `OP_UTXOBYTECODE`. If all contracts use dummies, it might simplify the Scripts. `OP_BLOCKHEIGHT` looks simpler & cleaner, where the Oracle can just publicly sign a price every 10 minutes without bothering with any TXIDs or covenants. However invoking `OP_BLOCKHEIGHT` can't be [dsproof protected](https://reference.cash/protocol/network/messages/dsproof-beta) (many confirmations may be required for all subsequent payments in a chain).

Oracles might use 5 minute **moving average**s, since on-chain Hedging could cause price manipulation at Centralized Exchanges, but not necessarily for 5 whole minutes.

American-style & European-style Hedging is different because with the latter the Hedge can't Exit before maturity (set maturity only). If Hedges need to be able to Exit whenever they want, the Oracles can sign prices along with TXIDs which change as the block-height changes. It'd cost less to Exit sooner, since the effective **premium** should go up with block-height.

One potential issue with using 5of8 price feeds is that the Hedge could Exit using 5 prices which are slightly in their favor, conceivably at 100x leverage. **10x** leverage is safer than 1x, since only 10% as much money need be risked (similar to a 10% stop-loss).

A P2SH **Script** for a 5of8 escrow could look like:

    2of2              (Cooperative Exit)
    1of2+5of8         (Smart-Oracles judge dispute)
    2of2+1of8+Return  (Smart-Oracle changes TXID of contract)
    Timeout           (5 week clawback)

The Hedge might always pay the txn fees of TXID changes. The Oracles involved could form part of a **Smart-Validator-Network**. Like how smartBCH has validators, the `OP_RETURN` contracts in BTC could have validators, too.

**Edit**: BCH can't handle compound interest (`OP_EXP`), whereas BTC `OP_RETURN` contracts could easily handle that.  
One perspective is that the P2SH or P2WSH unlocking Script is like the **Bailiff** in Court, whereas the `OP_RETURN` script is the **Judges**. The judges are capable of higher level judgements. It's like ""layer-1.5"", somewhere btwn layers 1 & 2 (if layer 2 is RSK or Blockstream's Liquid, then using nothing but an `OP_RETURN` is different).",0,btc,2022-09-28 13:20:03

Edit: **USTerra went bust in late May 2022.

xru73k,gotificial,28,https://redd.it/xru73k,‚å® Discussion,"I think that Do Kwon is civilly responsible but criminally not guilty, what are the Americans' thoughts on this?","As a South Korean lawyer (not attorney), I would like to present an opinion.

It is true that Do Kwon made a mistake, but at least under Korean law, he is not criminally guilty. To Do Kwon, two charges can be examined: one is a violation of the Similar Receipt Prohibition Act(SRPA) and the other is a violation of the Capital Markets Act(CMA).

First, we look at the SRPA.

This law applies only to money(fiat). That's, it does not apply to coins. It is therefore clear that he does not violate this law.

In terms of  the Capital Markets Act(CMA) ,

South Korean prosecutors are sticking to the law. In other words, they argue that TerraLuna under the CMA corresponds to ""investment contract securities(ICS)"". But this part is controversial. To start with the conclusion, this is an unauthorized change in interpretation. In more detail,

The interpretation of a law or a provision can change with changes in times or situations. For example, if an act was explicitly or implicitly judged to be legal three years ago, but it is necessary to define the act as illegal according to the change of the times, it is possible to change this interpretation. However, even in this case, it is common to go through changes to existing regulations. At the very least, the Supreme Court undergoes an explicit procedure called case change. It is directly contrary to the principle of Nulla poena sine lege (no penalty without law at the time) to determine that past acts are retroactively illegal without going through such amendments to laws or changes to precedents. Therefore, Do Kwon was legitimate based on the law at the time of the act.

The Ripple lawsuit has already been filed at the end of 2020, but, since then, South Korean prosecutors have not regulated or prosecuted any of the South Korean DeFies. They didn't even launch an investigation. In other words, Defi was legal at the time and was not classified as securities. That was the law of the day and also the reality. Unlike the United States, South Korea has its own legal interpretation as an independent country. According to this, TerraLuna does not belong to securities. This is exactly the same as TerraLuna not violating the SRPA. If TerraLuna is to be classified as a securities, in the case of Korea, a statute law country, it is necessary to revise the law and clarify it.

There is a grand principle of law. An ambiguous law is null and void. Article 4 (6) of the CMA did not regard coins as securities (investment contract securities) or at least it was ambiguous on that point. Therefore, in order to include coins as securities in the future, there must be an amendment to clarify the laws and regulations, or at least an explicit case change of the court.

Nevertheless, why did the Korean prosecution issue an arrest warrant for Do Kwon even in this obvious legal interpretation situation? The reason is simple. This is a reason anyone can easily understand. The reason is because the issue has become too politically large. If the prosecution does not indict Do Kwon, it should be subjected to huge public criticism. It's just this. There is no other reason. If this was a small case, there was no possibility that an arrest warrant would be issued to Do Kwon.

The South Korean prosecution should promise to investigate Do Kwon without detention when he returns to Korea. This is a case in which an arrest warrant was issued for the benefit of the prosecutor (to avoid criticism from the public) against an innocent person (which, of course, does not mean that he is not civil liable). If the prosecution says it will investigate him in custody, there is no reason for Do Kwon to return home. The prosecution also knows that it is ashamed of itself. Most lawyers have the same perception. However, the emotional public opinion of the ignorant people is making Do Kwon wander abroad. In order to solve this problem, it is appropriate for the prosecution to promise an investigation without detention and only to take measures to ban departure. If the prosecution does not accept this, Kwon Do-hyung may refuse to enter home. This is not against conscience.

If the Korean prosecution guarantees the investigation without detention, it is desirable for Do Kwon to enter Korea and stand trial. South Korean judges are not fools. It can be seen from the recent provisional disposition case of Lee Joon-seok. South Korean judges are reliable. The current arrest warrant was issued by the court, namely by the judge, not because Do Kwon was guilty, but only because he did not respond to the summons. It is only a reason that has nothing to do with guilt or innocence. In short, only the prosecutor needs to change his mind. If the prosecutor insists on an arrest investigation until the end, this can be a justifiable reason for the Do-kwon not to respond to the summon.",0,btc,2022-09-30 06:28:03

xteoqy,Turbulent_Mind9075,40,https://redd.it/xteoqy,ü§î Opinion,Why Nexo is here to stay OR Too much FUD ado about nothing,"Over the last week we all saw Nexo being catapulted with news and FUD, which, strangely enough to a lot of spectators or bad actors, left it unscathed. Here's a set of explanations as to why I believe it was so. The attacks on one of the few stable lenders after June followed as such and I will delve into separately:

1. The[ New York Attorney General vying to sue Nexo over not registering as a security because of its earn product and 7 other state regulators issuing C&D letters](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/09/26/eight-states-file-action-against-nexo-crypto-lending-platform.html) of the same product. -[ Yet Nexo doesn't offer its earn product](https://nexo.io/blog/nexos-stance-on-us-state-regulators-cease-desist-letters-regarding-our-earn-product) in the US and announced the[ purchasing a bank a stakeholder](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/09/27/crypto-lender-nexo-acquires-minority-stake-in-occ-regulated-summit-national-bank/), so what's the deal and why it is interesting for the whole of crypto?
2. Bad actors or FUDsters - the same ones who were virtually 100% certain Nexo was insolvent - using the opportunity to claim or promise Nexo's insolvency. - Will cover every point and why it was manipulative and cherry picked. (links excluded deliberately, though you will easily find Dirty Bubble or Otteroooo)
3. Cointelegraph[ pretty-much copy-pasting said FUDster's claims](https://cointelegraph.com/news/nexo-risks-50-drop-due-to-regulatory-pressure-and-investor-concerns) of $NEXO 50% drop with little substantiation and later strangely[ insinuating that a withdrawal from MakerDAO](https://cointelegraph.com/news/nexo-labeled-address-withdraws-153m-in-wrapped-btc-from-makerdao) was a sign of said insolvency. - Yet $NEXO hasn't shown many signs of dropping. As for MakerDAO, Nexo thereafter quadruple the deposit and even took out a small pocket sum of stables to make fun of the claim

TLDR: Apart from the first point, which is also interesting to the extent of bizarre and worth looking into, the rest is just cherry-picked argumentation, manipulated and twisted, as it ought to be to engender good FUD. But it didn't work and whoever is interested in looking into why, you may read into this and we may comment.

&#x200B;

1. On the strange case of NYAG and 7 other state regulators' actions against Nexo.

**The Legal conundrum** The eye-catching bit to anyone one who's looked into such cases is that the allegations rest on one of Nexo's products and no other, nor it's general practice. We're talking about the earn product, which is not available in the US. For those of you who have never had any stake in a TradFi fund, here's a layman explanation why regulators would have an issue with any earn product: when you buy into a TradFi fund before that you get a booklet of a hundred or more pages explaining how it functions and makes money, so you can assess risks beforehand. In the US for crypto this is not regulated - there is no legal framework for how such booklets should look like and what parameters / structure they should follow obviously because it's not TradFi - it's crypto. So what we're dealing with is institutions that have decided to take actions to halt the earn products before such regulation exists, without having the law stating how it should exist to claim it's been broken. This is one of the main legal conundrums. Hence, the bombastic claims by NYAG Letitia James of defrauding, well, they're just that - overblown. We can somewhat explain them because she's campaigning for reelection and clients of other lenders such as Voyager and Celsius have fallen victim to their bankruptcies. Nexo FYI obviously didn't go bankrupt and its clients' funds remained safe throughout the recent crash, so it does kind of seem like it was the only lender to go after. Regardless, the important point here is that there is still no law, nor a court ruling (a precedent), that states how a crypto earn product should function. There is only a[ SEC guidance](https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2022-26), which is an interpretation of a 1940, law attempting to bridge crypto to the current framework. It is since the existence of said guidance - February this year - that Nexo halted its earn product by its own decision.

**So why the hell did 8 states' regulators take action against Nexo? - The political conundrum** One supposition is the elections in November for Governors, who appoint regulators, and for the AG in NY, who carries the same responsibility. A glance shows that those actors are anti-crypto. For example, while Leticia James (D) claims ALL crypto platforms must register as securities (which is ridiculous without a legal framework for crypto that virtually all NY Democrats oppose), California Governor Newsom outright vetoed the crypto bill voted by the California State Legislature exactly a month ago, with the lame argument ""it's too early"". So apart from the legal conundrum described above, we find a political one too. The paradox is we have anti-crypto Governors and AG, who claim they want to defend people against fraud, while preventing the very legislation that would secure against it. The supposition is that they're defending, for better or for worse, TradFi. This makes most sense for NY - just imagine all those investment bankers and brokers having to compete against the better yields that the nascent crypto market already provides to so many people, after having complied with so much regulation. A conundrum it is, but TradFi can't have its pie and eat it too, ti cannot have crypto sidelined as a competitor because of lack of regulation and deny that regulation also. The issue here is who falls victim because of this. Well, it's not only those who have fallen victim to bad (or irresponsibly risky) actors like Celsius, but also those who are limited from benefiting to good (or stable) actors like Nexo.

**So is there any legal substance for actions against Nexo in the C&Ds? Theoretically, yes. In practice, hardly and in reality, innovation suffers. Will it hold in court? - Unlikely** Ideally of course it'd be great for all of us to get a booklet on how we earn through crypto CeFi or even DeFi, that follows rule of law and is scrutinised by a checked third party. Theoretically the substance behind the actions is that any earn product that makes use of the depositor's fund should always have been registered as a security. However, crypto being inherently different, to the extent of even being neglected to this day as ""real finance"" by many in the institutions, as well as requiring it's own legal framework and regulation... well, it is like the very institutions which were meant to take it seriously years ago failed to do so and are catching-up too late. The does have legal significance. For the layman, imagine you start an innovative business with a smart model and you grow it over five years, adhering to all **applicable** (because it's innovative) regulation and on the 6th year you get told you broke the *spirit* of the law, while no institution took care to fix the law to make it applicable the changing times nor to even try to conform you to the existing law early on. The legal significance lies in the importance of **precedent** in Anglo-Saxon law. Since there is no law, nor court ruling (a previous precedent), but only an SEC guidance as of February 2022, to which Nexo complied, it can hardly hold that even that interpretation would be applicable retrospectively to accounts that earned interest on deposits before the guidance. This is more of a civilisational conundrum, a mix of both how fast we're developing vs. how fast tech and crypto is vs. how fast political & state institutions can catch up to the changing times. **What clearly differentiates Nexo for me, compared to its previous and current competitors, is all the signs of a clear understanding of the challenges in front of crypto. It is the first lender to buy a bank (for its banking license btw), all in the endeavour to bridge the gap between TradFi and Crypto by exploiting the every legal opportunity.** Just FIY, it is because of this same endeavour that they're the only lender in the space to have some sort of[ audit, as via Armanino](https://real-time-attest.trustexplorer.io/nexo). And when it comes to transparency it is of great importance to note that until there is a legal framework and regulation, requiring extreme transparency and/or insinuating lack thereof means automatically 'scam' is more related to shorts or other bad-actor action in crypto. In this sphere, until there is regulation one ought to judge a company by its attempts to be as transparent as possible **in action (not in 'speak'** like Mashinsky\*\*)\*\* without giving away its whole business model (because that would render in non-competitive).

**2. On FUDsters' claims for insolvency**

Before, in June, they were based on insinuating the domino effect and trying to panic people into a bank run. Nexo had no exposure to AC3, to GBTC, to Luna, to risky DeFi protocols dependent on the bull run and dogmatically abstained from uncollateralized loans. Logically it survived the crash with assets exceeding liabilities. What was attacked by FUDsters now therefore was the fact its assets exceed liabilities. They did so latching onto the fact that the Kentucky's 13th article in the C&D stated Nexo held 96% of its token and if you were to remove the them, the liabilities would exceed. The manipulation was essentially in that they ""forgot"" the fact that the 96% of $NEXO on the platform comprised both of what Nexo owns and of what all of it's customers own. Almost every Nexo client is a $NEXO hodler because having 10% of his wallet in $NEXO means he gets best rates for earn and credit - it's a utility token, it's market valued and is worth just as much as any other asset under management by Nexo. Cheap manipulation. There's more defudding to be done, where my prose sort of ends and I'll just post my notes.

Note how other utility token are held on other platforms:

* Binance holds \~90% of the total supply of $[BNB](https://etherscan.io/token/tokenholderchart/0xB8c77482e45F1F44dE1745F52C74426C631bDD52):

* CDC holds > 85% of the total supply of $[CRO](https://etherscan.io/token/tokenholderchart/0xa0b73e1ff0b80914ab6fe0444e65848c4c34450b):

On insinuation that Nexo‚Äôs situation is the same as the one that toppled Celsius. FUDsters claim that when a company faces hard times and people start withdrawing their funds, the token collapses and the company becomes insolvent. While they‚Äôre not wrong principle, they are in fact. Nexo must have experienced heavy outflows during the period of Celsius‚Äô bankruptcy. While multiple platforms halted withdrawals and imposed withdrawal limits, Nexo had none of said issues. This was possible due to the proper risk management that they practiced - only over-collateralized loans, no exposure to LUNA, 3AC or GBTC, fully de-risked their DeFi positions early in the bear market and had significant liquidity on hand. Also the latest info from Nexo, which was posted on Twitter from a customer, states that $NEXO tokens represent less than 10% of the total AUM and even without them their assets still exceed total liabilities. I saw one defudder calculated that even if the massaged number by the FUDsters were to be true, liabilities would exceed assets only by 18% by their own numbers, which is miles aways from insolvency, even though it obviously won't be good news and would make investors/depositors weary.

Insinuation that because Nexo owns all crypto against which it loans/liquidates, it owns all its own tokens as claimed above and also all its clients' bags in case of insolvency, so you'll be screwed in case of insolvency.

Well this is FUD par excellence and probably the stupidest argument I've heard. It was meant to appeal to the scare they could end up like Celsians did. But the same applies to CDC, BlockFi and Nexo clients. Not your keys, not your crypto is the truest banality in the sphere. In case of insolvency everyone is screwed to begin with and it's only outside of crypto that you have the security of some govenment institution or insurance and it depends on the country. While there is no legal framework all lenders use the formula of contractual transfer of funds in T&Cs to secure loans and if necessary liquidations.

For example[ Abra](https://www.abra.com/terms-of-service-us/)‚Äôs T&Cs state:

*Consent to Rehypothecate. Except where prohibited or limited by applicable law, in consideration for the interest earned on your Wallet, you grant Prime Trust and Abra the right, without further notice to you, to hold the digital asset held in your Wallet in Prime Trust or Abra‚Äôs name or in another name, and to pledge, repledge, hypothecate, rehypothecate, sell, lend, or otherwise transfer or use any amount of such digital asset, as principal, agent or otherwise, separately or together with other property, with all attendant rights of ownership, and for any period of time and without retaining in Prime Trust or Abra‚Äôs possession and/or control a like amount of digital asset, and to use or invest such digital asset at its own risk. You acknowledge that, with respect to assets used by Abra pursuant to this paragraph, (i) you may not be able to exercise certain rights of ownership and (ii) Abra may receive compensation in connection with lending or otherwise using digital asset in its business to which you will have no entitlement.*

Similarly,[ CDC‚Äôs](https://crypto.com/exchange/document/lending-tnc) T&Cs state:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/yqgt4xdt7br91.png?width=904&format=png&auto=webp&s=f9f62c45523f1fe5b8f9a83962236cac8e425c71

Insinuation that Nexo's token is illiquid, even less liquid than $CEL (comparison insinuating doom). FUDster uses data for $NEXO‚Äôs 24h volume on Sept. 26 and claims that $NEXO‚Äôs trading volume is less than 1% of the token‚Äôs total market cap.

Nexo is a utility token - it‚Äôs meant for holding a lot more than trading. Actually this is why up until a year ago the dividends for Nexo were paid out yearly, i.e. it was meant to resemble equity via its smart contract. Similarly $BNB is also a utility token, however it has way more incentives to be traded or used as payment. Besides its utility within the BNB chain ecosystem, as Binance is the biggest exchange, the BNB token can be used on a number of platforms related to payments, entertainment, traveling, etc. For example, users can pay in BNB through Coinpayments, Coingate, Monetha, Coinify. They can also use it at Trip.io, Travala.com, Decentraland, BitTorent, etc.

Second, the same holds for the majority of utility tokens out there. For example, $BNB‚Äôs 24h trading volume to market cap on the same date was $252,974,909 to $44,725,198,716 or 0.57%. Similarly, the ratio for $[CRO](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/cronos/historical_data#panel) on the same date was $29,351,200 to $2,920,302,450 or 1%. $[FTT‚Äôs](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ftx-token/historical_data#panel) ratio was 0.74%.

Insinuation that Nexo is dodgy and trading volume may be even lower, because it is traded on ‚Äúhighly questionable‚Äù exchanges, among which he mentions MEXC Global, BKEX Exchange BingX, and Dcoin.

To be honest, it‚Äôs the first time I even heard about the existence of these exchanges and I certainly doubt that Nexo has partnered with them about a listing of $NEXO. Those exchanges likely decided to list $NEXO of their own accord. That's to be confirmed by Nexo also. -[ BKEX announcement](https://twitter.com/BKEXGlobal/status/1275763002709401600) \- not retweeted or even liked by NEXO

\-[ MEXC announcement](https://twitter.com/MEXC_Global/status/1547989208710926337) \- not retweeted or even liked by NEXO

\-[ BingX announcement](https://twitter.com/BingXOfficial/status/1489259761329934337) \- not retweeted or even liked by NEXO

Plus, no announcements made from Nexo‚Äôs website and official Twitter. At the same time, when Nexo was listed on[ Binance](https://twitter.com/Nexo/status/1520047874607882240) and[ FTX](https://twitter.com/Nexo/status/1470769385837060103), for example, the company made official announcements on social media and on its website.

3. On Cointelegraph reposting everything by FUDsters

If you've come to read everything this far, then a [glance at Cointelegraph's article would make you cringe](https://cointelegraph.com/news/nexo-labeled-address-withdraws-153m-in-wrapped-btc-from-makerdao), imo. Somewhat renowned, it was strange that Cointelegraph rehashed the above FUD points but instead of substantiating them, underlined a withdrawal of \~130M $WBTC from MakerDAO as spot-light proof it was failing to meet running business costs. How this is related to an alleged 50% drop in the token's pice, also stated in the article, is still a mystery. In fact it was, to my astonishment, the first time I see **Cointelegrph** or Coindesk or any other crypto **media speculate on a token's price in percentage pints, and to 50%**. But it was there. Shortly after being posted on twitter it created no discussion, but got some $NEXO token holders and some objective thinkers, not least in our **telegram chat NEXOnians,** to write in incomprehension. Hours later I was glad to see Nexo's response. Perhaps an Eastern, Balkan, Israeli, Southern American or Southern States FU to the whole media speculation, which was in action. - Contrary to the news, a deposit of $530m in WBTC on MakerDAO  by the smae wallet with three withdrawals in DAI, one of [$DAI 66,666, one of $DAI 88,888, and one of $DAI 101,01.01.](https://etherscan.io/address/0x8fd589aa8bfa402156a6d1ad323fec0ecee50d9d#tokentxns) for everyone to see...

xtzy0w,TheWorldofGood,40,https://redd.it/xtzy0w,ü§î Opinion,I came back to BCH and here‚Äôs why,"1. Bitcoin Cash is not going anywhere and it‚Äôll probably last decades more if not hundreds. It‚Äôs also listed on almost every exchange there is along with BTC and ETH. 

2. The Bitcoin.com wallet is and has always been the best wallet I‚Äôve had so far. The transaction speed is instantaneous quite literally within a second from Coinbase wallet and anywhere.

3. The price is the best at this moment. 98 percent of my crypto portfolio is now in BCH. Sure it can go down more but it will eventually go up sooner or later and I believe we are at the lowest price point right now. The rewards are greater than the risk.

4. The price can go up 100x, 200x, or even more due to its smaller market cap than BTC, which is already 300 billion dollars roughly. So at the best case scenario, BTC can go 10x or maybe 20x but that‚Äôs still unlikely in near future. BTC will probably go up to 5x or 8x best case scenario. If you look at the potential of upside, BCH wins hands down. 

People say that BTC‚Äôs past performance is greater but thats because BTC was a smaller market cap crypto back then. Not anymore.

5. The BCH community is great! This subreddit alone is a proof that BCH community cares about true progress and freedom without censorship.

6. We have Roger Ver on the team :) i think he‚Äôs the most trustworthy person in crypto if you ask me.

7. Tipping is great with BCH. Just install the Bitcoin.com wallet and link the address to Reddit.

8. A lot of developments are being made even now. BCH can also be used for other purposes than a fast reliable currency for everyone.",64,btc,2022-10-02 21:09:32

This issue is not a simple one. Many solutions and portal sites also have their own payment systems. They charge in advance and users pay with that charge. It is for the convenience of payment. Through this, it is possible to reduce bank fees that occur every time. It is essential.

The currency created by the needs of an autonomous organization can never be stopped. As I have already said, it is right for only the state to have the right to issue money.

xvbf6z,gotificial,4,https://redd.it/xvbf6z,None,The Basis of Money," Someone told me as follows. While writing an answer to it, I decided to post it here because the content of the article was prolonged.

**""If you can only create a token representing 100 joules by sacrificing 100 joules, then you cannot go corrupt in that token.""**

The basis for the existence of money is necessity, not cost. And the necessity is an appropriate money supply/stock.

The above sentence is difficult to understand immediately unless you are an economist.

There was a primitive tribe on an island in the South Pacific. They carve a stone roundly and drill a hole in the middle. That's how their currency is issued. They don't have numbers or letters. Therefore, the face value of the stone is determined by the size of the stone. Because they can't carry a very large stone currency, they put it on the street and shout loudly,

""I made this!""

Inform people that it belongs to the shouter. The same goes when the ownership of the stone currency is changed.

One day a hurricane hit the island. A big wave swept the big stone currency down into the sea. However, even in the sea, the stone would still exist, would not have been destroyed, and it could not be said that it was an accident due to the owner's carelessness, so the stone currency was still recognized as owned by the original owner. The stone currency was used as a means of transaction in the same way as in the past.

This is the essence of money. The islanders have an appropriate amount of total money(stone currency) supply. They also know that stones are worthless. Can't eat. They have as much stone currency as they need for the transaction. If someone is blinded by money and mass-produces stone currencies, the overall value of stone currency will decline. That is, money inflation occurs. As such, the value of the stone has no relation to the cost of stone manufacturing and is only determined by necessity. So did the gold at first. What initially determined the value of gold was its scarcity, not its cost of production. It was a long time later that production costs affected the value of gold.

Bitcoin's value is not due to its production cost. There is not even a ""necessity"" at the moment, as there is no particular shortage of global currency. It's just a waste of money economically. This is the same for at least all other coins, and frankly, I have to confess that it is the same for the coins I am developing.

But I admit Bitcoin is the only exception. Because its purpose is admirable. Internationally, they tried to prevent the ruthless issuance of dollars that pursue national priority, and domestically, they opposed printing money in the direction of pursuing the interests of vested powers. In other words, Bitcoin has an ideological value. And that value is definitely a necessary value.

Unfortunately, Bitcoin has a fatal limitation even though it has good intentions. That is the fact that the rigidity of prices has not been taken into account. Even if this was considered, there would have been no particularly suitable way.

When the economy develops, the corresponding amount of money supply is required. If the economy is to be operated with only a fixed amount of money without increasing the amount of money supply, the price must fall quickly and appropriately in accordance with the speed of economic development. In other words, Adam Smith's invisible hand must work extremely precisely. But this has already proved impossible. That is the issue of the famous price rigidity. Adam Smith stumbled upon this very obstacle.

Furthermore, even if the invisible hand works extremely sophisticated, it alone cannot achieve an economic paradise. This is because there is a terrifying monster called a monetary exit from the entire economic system. This includes not just the exit of money, but also the escape to all means of value storage. The event that this monster caused was the Great Depression.

*"" ‚Ä¶ Thus if currency notes were to be deprived of their liquidity-premium by the stamping system, a long series of substitutes would step into their shoes ‚Äî bank-money, debts at call, foreign money, jewellery and the precious metals generally, and so forth. ‚Ä¶ (Excerpt from NOTES ON MERCANTILISM, THE USURY LAWS, STAMPED MONEY AND THEORIES OF UNDER-CONSUMPTION, J.M. Keynes, The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money)""*

What will happen to Bitcoin's future with these limitations? This problem needs to be observed in two aspects. One is its survival aspect and the other is its purposeful aspect.

First of all, in terms of purpose, the economic theoretical limitations to Bitcoin are too big. Therefore, it is unlikely that Bitcoin will become a key currency.But just as gold was not a key currency and could still survive, I agree that Bitcoin survives permanently as digital gold.

Finally, I add one more thing. It is such a shame that Satoshi has set his holdings tremendously. If he had zeroed out his holdings or set them at a very small amount, the ideological value of Bitcoin would have been more than 10 times.",6,btc,2022-10-04 10:26:03

Bitcoin Magazine ran an op-ed ostensibly written by Bukele about El Salvador's adoption of BTC as legal tender. He makes some very good points despite BTC's precipitous price drop.

 

* Financial elites have many reasons to poo-poo BTC in El Salvador, ie. FEAR
* During 2021, El Salvador's economy grew 10.3%, or by $4 billion
* $50 million in *unrecognized* BTC losses is barely a flea on an elephant's back
* Other countries will likely adopt crypto as well (ie. Russia is wavering as we speak)
* Tourism is up 50% in El Salvador, which could well be related to BTC adoption
* Crime in ES has radically decreased, and Bukele has 4x the popularity rating of any G8 president

They discuss how statechains can enable privacy, how to onboard BTC Lightning users, and look at the interface of Mercury Wallet.

Read our notes below to learn more.

# Background

* In the past, he worked as a TradFi developer for banks.
* In 2012 started to get into BTC.
* Went full-time around 2016.

# Statechains on Mercury Wallet

* Mercury Wallet produces statecoins in which BTC can be put in and then transferred.
* An address with two private keys is created, where one private key is with the user and one with the recipient.
* To transfer it to another wallet, the recipient should create a statecoin address in Mercury.
* There is cooperation between the sender and statechain server to tweak the sender‚Äôs private key and generate a new private key for the recipient.
* With the two private keys, you‚Äôre creating one public key which exists on the BTC blockchain.
* There is a 3-month time limit during which statecoins can be sent back and forth.
* Mercury is non-custodial and the users can always pull their funds out.

# Mercury Wallet Interface

* The deposit button allows users to create a statecoin.
* Withdraw button allows taking your BTC back to BTC main chain.
* Privacy Score in the pop-up window means how many times the state coin has been swapped.

# Criticism

* Some people don‚Äôt like the hardware security module (HSM) that the team is using.
* To avoid the risk, the team has hard coded the 3-month period.
* Every L2 has a reduction in trust compromises.

# Regulatory Concerns

* Different lawyers have different views.
* The team is trying to copy what others are doing.
* They don‚Äôt have custody, they don‚Äôt charge for using the swaps, and they charge only for using the statechain entity.
* FinCen released a report in 2019 stating that non-custodial mixers are ok to operate.
* Custodial mixers are in control of the funds and you need a money transfer license.
* The team has plans to protect themselves.

# Thoughts on Fedimint

* [Fedimint](https://twitter.com/fedimint) is different, it‚Äôs similar to [Liquid Network](https://twitter.com/Liquid_BTC).
* Mercury is fixed UTXO, which means that you can‚Äôt break the statecoin into little pieces.
* The next step for statecoins is to integrate with BTC Lightning Network.

# Mercury Use Cases

* Mercury currently has around 16 BTC going through the system.
* Statecoins could be used for Discreet Log Contracts.
* The team is working on being able to onboard Lightning users.
* In some ways, Mercury is better than [Wasabi wallet](https://twitter.com/wasabiwallet), in some ways it‚Äôs not.
* Mercury is not doing any type of coin join, it‚Äôs doing coin swaps, which means that the exchanges can‚Äôt see anything. The downside is you might get a dirty coin.
* The team wants the project to be seen as an L2 project rather than only a privacy project.

xy1rvv,Fun_Assistance_1696,2,https://redd.it/xy1rvv,‚ùì Question ,About btc circulating supply and price calculation,"BTC circulating supply is now 19 billion out of the 21 billion cap.

Is it possible to calculate how much the price of btc will go up until it hits the 21 billion cap? I know there is some complicated math you can do about circulating supply, market cap, price etc, it's all connected to each other, so I think it's possible to calculate this I'm just not sure how exactly but I know this: 

Market Cap = Current Cryptocurrency Price x Total Amount of Coins in Circulation

I don't think we need to do any math about after it hits the max supply because that's over a 100 years into the future so we won't be alive then.

But with the previous formula, market cap isn't something that increases by itself, it's increased only if circulating supply or price increases. If we do some algebra:

Current Cryptocurrency Price = Market Cap / Total Amount of Coins in Circulation

This means price doesn't increase by itself, only if market cap or circulating supply increases but we already saw that market cap doesn't increase by itself. 

So only way for price to go up in value is if circulating supply increases? Is that right or wrong? It just doesn't seem like there's that much supply remaining when we're at 19 out of 21 billion already. Plus it's going to take more than 100 years to reach the max supply. Such as that it remains the potential as a world's reserve currency and king of digital gold, instead of some other blockchain taking that role, or some other tech, like I read something about some poeple working on a coin that is worth energy, not made with energy like btc but actually worth energy, although maybe that's WEF behind it, I think it sounds familiar to what I've heard their plans are with social scores, scary.

But I think there's probably more to it this just this simply calculation. There's supply and demand as well. I'm actually really bad at math so hopefully there's someone who's good at math who has this figured out and can ELI5. How can I calculate price potential of BTC within next 1-10 years?",0,btc,2022-10-07 15:16:18

BTC is digital gold because it's limited to 21 million and it takes a lot of work to mine BTC. So BTC is mostly valued for the amount of time it takes to mine and the energy spent doing it.

In the future we will have more energy available, so the energy spent mining btc now will be insignificant.
A great amount of people in the world will have access to computer and we'll also have much more powerful computers, so the time it took to mine BTC will insignificant with the new tech available to everyone.

So at that time, the only value to BTC is that there's a limited supply. But anyone can create a blockchain or any other kind of tech and make it limited.

So maybe what is more important than anything is the use case for BTC. But other blockchains like ETH, ADA, XMR have much better use case because of the smart contracts. BTC is just digital gold.",0,btc,2022-10-07 18:42:18

xyy9ap,hosseinzoda,14,https://redd.it/xyy9ap,None,Stablecoins are directly competing with cryptocurrencies,"## [Introduction](https://read.cash/@Hossein.Zoda/stablecoins-are-directly-competing-with-cryptocurrencies-559895f8#introduction)

At the core of it, cryptocurrencies and stablecoins are being  operated with public ledgers which is holding the record of who owns how  much of the token. One thing to note is that the value of these tokens  comes from their users.

The main difference between them is the issuance authority. A  cryptocurrency like BCH has no one issuing authority except miners who  will get rewarded for producing a new block in a predictable timeline,  I'm not going to get on why we need that, The reader is free to search  more about this design. On the contrary stablecoins have one issuing  authority which is also responsible for maintaining the value of the  token to one dollar.

This one key difference changes the power structure quite a bit. And I  believe stablecoin should not be regarded as neutral tokens with no  influece in the crypto market. The operators of these tokens have the  power to invest in another business as long they are able to maintain  the peg of their token to one dollar. And apparently they are doing  that.

In this article I will try to make the case that the current major  stablecoins are in direct conflict with the cryptocurrencies that are  intended to be used as cash.

## [Comparisons](https://read.cash/@Hossein.Zoda/stablecoins-are-directly-competing-with-cryptocurrencies-559895f8#comparisons)

The following are the common arguments for BCH as cash.

1. BCH is a well-known crypto token with liquid markets
2. It has fast settlements
3. It's easily accessible
4. Low fees
5. Limited supply

At this time USDT is ahead of BCH  for the first three arguments. It has deeper liquidity with near-instant settlements, Fees are low enough for average users and also It's more accessible. The only advantage left for BCH is the limited supply.

And I don't think having a token with a limited supply is a strong  enough advantage for competing with stablecoins as money. If things  continue like this, BCH may turn into yet another speculative asset to  speculate on.

## [Stablecoins should be considered as a form of investment](https://read.cash/@Hossein.Zoda/stablecoins-are-directly-competing-with-cryptocurrencies-559895f8#stablecoins-should-be-considered-as-a-form-of-investment)

As the current major stablecoins shown us, They are willing to invest  some of their assets up to a point that it will not hurt their core  business.

Basically stablecoins are very liquid form of investment vehicle with  zero benefits to token holders other that the ability for you to redeem  your money.

And if you look at it, They are investing selectively, For example  Tether would lend USDT to exchanges, Which is mostly used to speculate  further in the crypto market. And guess what majority of these  investments are not going to further the goal of using cryptocurrencies  as a means of payment.

## [Conflict of interest](https://read.cash/@Hossein.Zoda/stablecoins-are-directly-competing-with-cryptocurrencies-559895f8#conflict-of-interest)

Tether and Circle are openly advocating for their token to be used as  a medium of exchange. So basically it is not in their interest to  invest in things that will further the goal of using cryptocurrency as  money.

And that's why I claim it is against your interest to invest a  significant amount of your wealth in cryptocurrencies and stablecoins at  the same time.

## [Conclusion](https://read.cash/@Hossein.Zoda/stablecoins-are-directly-competing-with-cryptocurrencies-559895f8#conclusion)

The rise of stablecoins has significantly reduced the usefulness of  cryptocurrencies as money. And the convenience of using stablecoins has  diverted investments away from using cryptocurrencies as money. Which is  a big problem for those who would like to see cryptocurrencies to be  used as money.

I believe there's a solution for this problem. There should be a  marketplace for selling stable token liabilities which is designed to  further cryptocurrency adoption.

And that is my goal as a software developer in the next six months. My  next article is going to be about my vision on how we can change the  power dynamic by raising awareness and providing solutions for those who  want to see this happen.

xz1zed,ReveloIntel,0,https://redd.it/xz1zed,None,Unchained Podcast Summary: What Does SBF Think About the Current Crypto Market?,"[Sam Bankman-Fried](https://twitter.com/SBF_FTX) is the founder and CEO of [FTX](https://twitter.com/FTX_Official), a digital asset exchange.

In this episode of the [Unchained Podcast](https://twitter.com/Unchained_pod), he is being interviewed by [Laura Shin](https://twitter.com/laurashin), a journalist, and Unchained host. They touch on many topics, including stablecoins, the necessity of regulation, and even Sam‚Äôs political views.

Read our notes below to learn more.

# Thoughts on Crypto Markets

* BTC is going to be responsive to the general macro environment.
* Changes in interest rates are driving the market.
* Relative to stock markets crypto has stabilized.
* Regulatory environment clarity would have the biggest impact, particularly in the U.S.

# TradFi Markets

* Sam‚Äôs guess is that crypto and TradFi markets will evolve towards each other.
* Some of the most compelling applications in blockchain are in market structure.
* There is a limit on how much money retail is allowed to make with the current market structure.
* This can be fixed with clear, unambiguous settlement that‚Äôs fast and cheap, which blockchains provide.  


# Stablecoins

***Sam gives 4 categories of stablecoins:***

1. Fully backed stablecoins (e.g. USDC): A crash in these currencies shouldn‚Äôt happen.
2. Backed by debt instruments, but not exactly treasuries (e.g. USDT): In volatile times they might slightly drop. It‚Äôs a fine product but it should be disclosed that there is some risk.
3. Traditional algorithmic stablecoins (e.g. [Maker](https://twitter.com/MakerDAO) in the past): These are only somewhat stable. These should have very clear disclaimers of possible de-pegging.
4. LUNA: It‚Äôs a common misconception that it‚Äôs backed by Terra tokens while in reality it‚Äôs backed by the ability to mint new Terra tokens. Very unstable and it should have clear disclaimers because it might, and did go to zero.

# Thoughts on Institutional Leverage

* [Voyager](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/06/27/three-arrows-capital-crypto-hedge-fund-defaults-on-voyager-loan.html) is going through bankruptcy because of unpaid debt from Three Arrows Capital (3AC).
* 3AC took on that debt three weeks before its collapse.
* This is similar to 2008 when there were non-transparent systems, large leverage, etc.
* On-chain protocols don‚Äôt have this sort of problem because there‚Äôs transparency about borrowing and lending.
* There was more risk than Voyager‚Äôs customers understood, therefore, having disclosures, transparency, and more diligence is crucial.

# Risk Management

* [FTX](https://twitter.com/FTX_Official) team is working closely with [BlockFi ](https://twitter.com/BlockFi)team to understand what‚Äôs the best way to measure and manage risk.
* One thing would be to understand the nature of the counterparties, distributing the risk between many of them, taking actual collateral, and being careful about what that means.
* Being ready to margin-call people when necessary is important.

# Talks With Regulators

* It‚Äôs urgent to have a regulatory regime for crypto in the U.S.
* Some regulators do understand that the parts of the crypto world that get hurt are the parts that are least crypto-like (less transparency etc.).
* He is having a lot of discussions with lawmakers and his team wants to be helpful in any way they can.
* Lawmakers want straightforward constructive engagement.
* The priorities are stablecoin regulation, marketplace regulation, and token registration.

# Financial Regulation

* People get distracted by talking about more regulation vs less regulation, which is not the most important question.
* More important is the question of whether the regulation is fit for purpose.

# Decentralization vs Centralization

* FTX is a centralized company.
* The product they are building is a centralized product in a decentralized space.
* There are things that are more efficient if done by a centralized entity.
* However, [FTX](https://twitter.com/FTX_Official) is integrated with blockchain rails, with other centralized and decentralized players, and it is a part of the space.

# Alignment With the Democratic Party

* It‚Äôs policy, not politics that Sam cares about.
* No one issue is going to give a clear readout as to where Sam‚Äôs political affiliation lies.
* Crypto has been a somewhat bipartisan issue.
* Sam is looking for politicians who are doing good policy work in general, not specifically crypto-related.

# Alameda Research Concerns

* FTX has oversight and they are regulated in many jurisdictions.
* FTX marketplace is agnostic (they don‚Äôt care who sends an order apart from KYC).
* Sam is no longer working on [Alameda](https://twitter.com/AlamedaResearch), he doesn‚Äôt trade for it and is not involved in the day-to-day management.

# The Merge And BTC‚Äôs Narrative

* The merge happened in a very clean way which is impressive.
* BTC is the digital gold and it‚Äôs the most trusted and institutional, which is a different role from ETH‚Äôs core high trust smart contract blockchain role.
* BTC now is the only remaining major PoW coin.

# Macroeconomics

* FTX is keeping its reserves in cash.
* They want to be in a position where they can offer products that people want given the highly volatile and uncertain macro environment.

# What to Expect From FTX

* FTX is raising funds for deal-making.
* They are looking at companies that would make sense for them, including companies with in-depth regulatory know-how.
* They want to acquire great teams and businesses that have great user bases.
* FTX has a proposal to change the way derivatives are cleared which would make certain TradFi intermediaries obsolete.
* Working with Regulators to provide spot and futures from the FTX U.S. entity to Americans.

And for laser-eyed BTC believers, the adoption or lack thereof of LN is irrelevant. Digital gold is like a religion to them, and they will remain maximalists regardless of LN adoption.

It is no longer 2017. The most activity and growth right now is in defi and smart contracts. These will gradually make BTC less and less relevant, but they have the same effect on BCH. The implosion of SmartBCH was much more devastating for BCH than the languishing of LN ever will be for BTC.

The intense focus on LN is just a sad distraction from this fact. BCH is not competing with LN, it is competing with stablecoins and smart contract platforms.

xzy9uw,STP_VEGAS,10,https://redd.it/xzy9uw,None,Block Wars,"I've read about the block wars, but since then numerous people have onboarded to bitcoin, probably without really exploring any other coins.  There is so much pro-bitcoin media out there, a huge community, that it is near impossible to get an objective perspective.  I am happy for bitcoin and the lightning network being able to increase transaction speed, but I really feel that 2nd layer tech defeats the purpose of the decentralized nature of this new money.  I also see that bitcoin's slow ass speed is a major hinderance and. although the LN can increase this speed, it's 6 degrees of separation technology can't be used on a cell phone (yet) causing users of mass adoption to have to flock to trusted services, completely defeating the peer to peer nature of bitcoin.  Add to that, the wonderful Bitcoin media community - Nat Brunel, P & Q, Nic Carter, etc - are so busy rubbing each other's backs and promoting a big machine (while offering up a variety of informative interviews) that I can't help but wonder what the real end-game is for their Bitcoin.  
I've explored a few other coins, BCH, ZEC, LTC, ETH and I am very happy with one and another is a close second, but I still need more transactions under the belt, while the other two have been written off by me as far as currency usage is concerned, as they are either too clunky or too expensive to use.

Reason for me is simple: I‚Äôm tired of crypto. I don‚Äôt want/need 20 more different tokens, I just want a digital currency which I can use to pay, receive, and save. The other day I was thinking about it and it is pretty clear to that in a hundred years, if humanity still exists, BCH will still be around as well. I can‚Äôt say that with certainty about USD, EUR, GBP, or any other government issued currency, and I don‚Äôt feel comfortable with having my money in the hands of a bank. I‚Äôve been around for a long time and have experienced almost any crypto out there (in the top 200 at least), none of them come close to BCH in terms of ease-to-use. Also, I feel comfortable with BCH actually trying to scale to a point where anyone can use it‚Äôs base layer without it being a privilege for the rich. This is the bitcoin I fell in love with in the early days, and I still love today regardless of price. On top of that, I have enchanted privacy (cashfusion) and (EVM) smart contract usability (smartBCH, and soon CashTokens). So why would I even need anything other than? For me they serve no purpose, and I am tired of speculating in these markets. I just want to enjoy life and spread the good news of BCH.

Thus it's no surprise that massive bugs keep impacting the Lightning Network on a fairly regular basis. This week a large multisig Taproot BTC transaction caused hundreds of Lightning nodes to fork from the main chain. According to my reading, a bug in btcd prevented those nodes from accepting a 998 of 999 multisig transaction created by Burak ([https://twitter.com/brqgoo/status/1579216353780957185](https://twitter.com/brqgoo/status/1579216353780957185)).

Finally, here is the LN bug: [https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/issues/7002](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/issues/7002)

If Lightning is this fragile with hardly anyone using it, imagine trying to serve millions or billions of people with it. Once again we are reminded that Segwit was never needed and introduced massive code bloat and technical debt to BTC. Now Taproot is showing its ugly side, and once again the BTC Core devs are rearranging deck chairs on the Titanic.

Of course this will not be the last time that LN poops the bed, this multisig bug is likely the tip of a giant iceberg of Segwit/Taproot/btcd bugs. Also it may have opened a new attack vector, 999 signatures on a transaction will create large CPU overhead to validate.

So I decided to walk to the walk and go fully-FOSS, and utilize our top-notch design chops to bust out a wallet the FOSS community could be proud of.

Stack Wallet has a built-in third-party exchange (our business model), never pushes your keys off device, backup system for all of your wallets, and much more, with many more features on the way.

We're still in open beta, though we should be leaving that status within a week or so. Please give us a try and tell us what you think, how we could improve, or what features you'd love to see!

Visit our [website](https://stackwallet.com), check out our [Twitter](https://twitter.com/stack_wallet/) for giveaways, news, and updates, and download us on [iOS App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/stack-wallet-by-cypher-stack/id1634811534), [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/datasafety?id=com.cypherstack.stackwallet), or add us on F-Droid ([instructions here](https://fdroid.stackwallet.com)).

y4fca3,Xanather,19,https://redd.it/y4fca3,‚öôÔ∏è Technology,Announcing Bitcoin Core++,"Hey all, I can't post this in /r/bitcoin since it would likely get shut down immediately. I've been around this community for a long time so I'm aware of the situation.

I've been spending some time on a small Bitcoin Core patch that requires a hard-fork 99% BIP8 versionbit activation via bit 27.

The rationale of this patch is that Bitcoin's 1MB non-weighted limit will inevitably become outdated as time passes because technology, need I say more...

I wanted to give users and miners the option to signal for larger blocks over time while still preferring to use the main-chain and have absolute minimal risk in introducing a regression by keeping the changes small.

I'm looking for other developers experienced with Bitcoin Core to help flesh out this small patch: [https://github.com/bitcoin-pp/bitcoin/pull/1](https://github.com/bitcoin-pp/bitcoin/pull/1)

The idea is to keep the patch up-to-date with Bitcoin Core indefinitely and as small as possible.

The patch does not go into specific of how the block-size limit should be increased, but rather removes it altogether. The idea is that a formal BIP gets merged in to formalize the new size before the fork occurs once super-majority consensus is approaching.

Due to how BIP8 works, Bitcoin Core clients will alert of unknown rule before the hard-fork occurs (last 9% of the threshold).

I will be maintaining this patch for the indefinite future. I don't expect it to get activated within the next decade but I would like to build some trust around this patch for when the time comes that the 1MB non-weighted limit is seriously outdated and Bitcoin Core's hard-fork patching process becomes a major blocker. I'll create another post here and elsewhere once its been properly reviewed and ready for main-net use and auto-generation of binaries is available.

Edit: This isn't being well received as I thought. I feel most people are skimming over the details.

If you find yourself having needing to integrate with the BTC network, but want a lightweight patch ontop of the reference client to make it known you're not happy with the 1MB rule but don't want to fork the network then that's what this patch is for. Version bit 27 likely will never be used, and has an indefinite window. Older clients which signaled support for such a thing are long dead and outdated. I'm not trying to fork BTC again...",1,btc,2022-10-15 05:17:23

y6dx3j,TheWorldofGood,10,https://redd.it/y6dx3j,ü§î Opinion,The name that is Bitcoin CASH and I hate it,"It might be just me but I really dislike that Bitcoin Cash is often associated with Bitcoin Core or more commonly known as THE Bitcoin.

My first impression on Bitcoin Cash (BCH) was ‚Äúwhat is this? Is this a copycat of Bitcoin (BTC)?‚Äù Then I learned more about it and found out that BCH is much superior to BTC in every way and is the true Bitcoin.

But what I know now doesn‚Äôt really matter because most people don‚Äôt have the time nor the interest to do their research into Bitcoin to find out the fact that BCH is the real Bitcoin.

What that means is that BCH will always live in the shadow of BTC and there will always be a misconception about BCH being a copycat of Bitcoin although it‚Äôs not true.

Perhaps in the future, people will accept BCH as a functional peer to peer cash instead of the broken ‚Äústore of value‚Äù BTC. But will that happen for sure? It‚Äôs hard to tell.

What I do know is that the name ‚ÄúBitcoin Cash‚Äù is absolutely not a great name or a brand. Imagine if Toyota‚Äôs name was ‚ÄúMercedes Car‚Äù. That would create a massive misunderstanding and bias against the great car company even though their cars are great in quality.

Another thing to point out is the fact that you have to explain the difference between Bitcoin Core and Bitcoin Cash to new comers. They have to be informed that Bitcoin Cash is not Bitcoin Core and vice versa. Why? Because both have the name ‚ÄúBitcoin‚Äù in it.

I think BCH is great and it should be successful if the world embraces cryptocurrencies as a spendable currency system. But as long as BCH has the name ‚ÄúBitcoin‚Äù in it, there will be many confused people and negative biases against it.",0,btc,2022-10-17 15:23:53

y6kh6d,ReveloIntel,0,https://redd.it/y6kh6d,None,Summary: Is BTC.b the Key to Enabling BTC DeFi?,"BTC.b is a recently added BTC token native to the [Avalanche network](https://twitter.com/avalancheavax).

**In episode 23 of the** [**DeFi podcast**](https://twitter.com/DefiPodcast), hosts [JF Saine](https://twitter.com/DefiPodcast) and[ Jared M](https://twitter.com/M0xrrissey) welcome Michelle Tian, a product manager at [Ava Labs,](https://twitter.com/avalabsofficial) who has a background in strategy, credit, and structured products.¬† In this podcast, she explains what having native BTC can enable on the AVAX network.

Read our notes below to learn more.

# What is BTC.b?

* Native BTC that has been bridged from BTC network to AVAX network.
* BTC handles UTXOs (condition specifying currency remaining after a transaction is executed) which is why BTC wallets are HD (hierarchical deteriministic).
* AVAX core wallet has simplified the process so that the transaction is sent into one wallet for the user, rather than multiple as would be the case on a bitcoin wallet.
* BTC bridging only available on core wallet.

# Intel SGX

* Intel SGX is hardware technology that creates trusted execution environments.
* These execution environments function off-chain, preventing other parties from having access to minting or burning of tokens.
* Instead, 6 of 8 bridge nodes are needed to approve any transaction.
* AVAX uses collateral checks so that more tokens can‚Äôt be minted than what is available on the AVAX bridge itself.

# Warden System

* Bridge has 8 nodes run by wardens including: [Ankr](https://twitter.com/ankr), [Blockdaemon](https://twitter.com/BlockdaemonHQ), [Chainstack](https://twitter.com/ChainstackHQ), [Protofire](https://twitter.com/protofire), [Avascan](https://twitter.com/AvascanExplorer), [Bware Labs](https://twitter.com/BwareLabs), [Halborn](https://twitter.com/HalbornSecurity?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor), and Ava Labs.
* 6 of 8 groups have to agree on a transaction for the smart contract to actually mint or burn tokens.
* These independent companies listen for incoming transactions to validate and verify so they can send to off-chain enclave.

# AVAX Bridge

* Most bridges are very smart contract reliant.
* AVAX bridge has very limited smart contract use on AVAX side, none on ETH side.
* AVAX bridge contracts similar to [Open Zepplin](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/erc20) ERC-20 smart contracts.
* 4 audits have been completed in the year since the bridge has been around.
* Security features include bridge monitoring, collateral checks, 24-7 on call engineering support, [pagerduty](https://www.pagerduty.com/), and [Yubikey 2FA](https://www.yubico.com/).
* Team has also implemented a bug bounty program.
* Many bridge exploits can be traced back to 1 operator being compromised.
* [Trail of Bits](https://www.trailofbits.com/) recent research claims that ETH network can be compromised with 2 comprimised operators, BTC with 4.
* Bridge has very low latency, due to using the Avalanche consensus algorithm.
* Bridge UI shows different stages of bridging process, is transparent.

# BTC.b vs BTC Lightning

* Lightning uses state channels which allows fast and cheap off-chain payments.
* Lightning network abstracts difficult transactions onto a Layer 2 ledger.
* BTC.b allows many DeFi opportunities for trading, borrowing, and lending.
* BTC.b TVL is \~$60m compared to BTC Lightning Network TVL \~$100m.
* ***JF***
* [Moremoney](https://twitter.com/Moremoneyfi) (AVAX native borrowing protocol) sees increasing demand for BTC.b integrations.

# BTC.b vs WBTC

* WBTC (wrapped BTC) is centralized, users have to submit request to 1 of 17 merchants who can process minting or redemption.
* The BTC is held in custody in exchange for WBTC.
* [BTC.b minting](https://bridge.avax.network/) is unrestricted, can be done at any time.
* BTC.b require flat $3 fee to mint compared to WBTC which involves merchant and custodian fees which scale with transaction size.
* Avalanche doesn‚Äôt profit from this fee, it‚Äôs just used to cover transaction costs.
* BTC.b is more accessible as it doesn‚Äôt need KYC or AML like WBTC does.
* Ava Labs wants to grow the BTC ecosystem on AVAX.

# BTC.b Growth

* BTC.b was recently added to [Aave](https://twitter.com/AaveAave) and [Benqi](https://twitter.com/BenqiFinance) (borrowing and lending dApps).
* WBTC.e (AVAX native WBTC) has around \~$110m TVL, which shows more growth for BTC.b

***JF***

* AVAX Network TVL is \~$1.5 billion, acquiring 1% of BTC in BTC.b would triple AVAX Network TVL.

***Jared***

* BTC.b is much closer to holding actual BTC than WBTC as it‚Äôs not centralized and can be held in self-custody.

# Subnets

* Team is working on cross-subnet communication which would open up many new use cases with arbitrary data passing.
* This involves communication between subnets and AVAX C-Chain (EVM compatible chain).
* Team will be building a VM (virtual machine) library which will enable subnets to add code easily with very little technical activity, could be as simple as 3 command lines.
* This enables tokens, NFTs, governance information to be relayed across bridges.
* This could bring more dApps and functionality into the AVAX ecosystem.

***Jared***

* Building a subnet is currently just as difficult as building a bridge.

I don't understand why no one is posting about this (though there is a CashFusion Telegram channel). Did the Tornado Cash clampdown change the situation? If so, this community has never operated as a culture of fear - think of the various FUD and attacks we've been through.

If you have the latest ElectronCash, it should be preloaded with those settings. Let's go!!

Edit: I wasn't trying to be dramatic or alarmist with the title, as I really thought CashFusion was broken, since I was showing connected to the CashFusion and Electron Cash servers, respectively, and nothing was happening.

y8cgap,ReveloIntel,1,https://redd.it/y8cgap,None,Podcast Summary: Is BTC Maximalism Fading Away?,"[Nic Carter](https://niccarter.info/) is a founding partner of [Castle Island Ventures](https://www.castleisland.vc/), and a prominent voice in the crypto community.

In this episode of [The Scoop](https://twitter.com/TheScoopPod), host [Frank Chaparro](https://twitter.com/fintechfrank) welcomes Nic on to discuss his thoughts on BTC maximalism, crypto regulation, stablecoins, and the best opportunities in crypto right now.

Read our notes below to learn more.

# Crypto Regulation

* Being wrong about timing is the same thing as being wrong: Nic thought regulators would be more aggressive earlier.
* Every country experienced retail losses from [LUNA collapse](https://twitter.com/ReveloIntel/status/1582508146739666945) .
* LUNA collapse was a failure of expectations, as it was thought to be stable.
* Gold was illegal in 1930s and 1940s because it was an alternative to US government debt.
* Governments want you to hold their debt, not crypto, even if it‚Äôs stablecoins.
* Crypto should be more proactive on regulation, rather than just waiting for regulators.
* Crypto isn‚Äôt as transparent as people think it is, as most people don‚Äôt have the ability to access the onchain information.
* Protocols should be providing onchain information to users.

# Thoughts on Stablecoins

* [Circle](https://twitter.com/circle) USDC has become the most credible stablecoin.
* Stablecoin regulation compliance models include state trust charters, onshore money transmitters and offshore methods.
* Stablecoins take different approaches to OFAC compliance.
* Is it fair to call them ‚Äústablecoins‚Äù when fiat currencies experience high inflation?
* Stablecoins should include interest to help offset the inflation.
* Holding stablecoins instead of buying US Treasuries shows that people think there is 10% yield to be found in crypto.

***Frank***

* Purpose of fiat currencies is not to keep price stable, but to provide a medium of exchange.
* Stablecoins are actually stable in crypto, because everything else is extremely volatile.

# Thoughts on BTC Maximilism

* Anyone that holds BTC is a Bitcoiner.
* Nic separated himself from the more religious part of BTC community.
* Money and religion are distinct, should stay this way.
* Many things such as fitness, veganism, environmental activism, and BTC are ways for people to maintain some religious practices without actually being religious.
* Bitcoiners may have overstated role BTC plays in energy transition in the U.S.

# How Castle Island is Positioned

* Valuations are down, founder quality is up.
* Fund is deploying at a healthy rate, especially in DeFi.
* DeFi has been unloved in crypto the past year from VC.
* Most crypto data in mainstream media is wrong.
* Castle Island is interested in NFTs with utility and use cases.

# Most Overlooked Opportunities

* BTC-related startups were overlooked for a while, not anymore.
* Nic values businesses focused on onboarding the ‚Äòglobal south‚Äô.
* Nic values undercollateralized lending innovation; this is how crypto will get out of the credit crisis.
* Successful crypto lending firms will transition into blockchain based model.
* Forward-looking crypto lenders will use hybrid model: they rely on legal contracts but also benefit from putting activity onchain.¬†
* This transparency helps regulators and clients.
* Insurgent companies, rather than established ones, bring new ideas.

I am not exaggerating when I am saying that I took maybe 100 selfies and the service simply wouldn't accept the shape of my face for whatever reason, perhaps according to binance's ai system I am an alien.

Long story short I never managed to verify my account, and their terms of services say that they have every right to keep my information for as long as they want.

I never used any CEXEs before I always got my crypto from services like paxful/merchants or ATM's, this experience convinced me fully to never even try to use one of their services again.

What's ironic is how we are supposedly using crypto to escape the tiresome ordeals and protocols of the banks and the governments, yet when I tried to make a simple binance account, I faced the same tiresome-protocols I face with every other bank.

- [CoinJoin Desktop App for Financial Privacy](https://coinjoin-flipstarter.psfoundation.info/en)

This Flipstarter campaign is looking for $12,000 USD (113 BCH) to fund the development of a desktop app that functions similar to [CashFusion](https://cashfusion.org/). As the campaign lays out, users have been experiencing issues with trying to use CashFusion for several months. [This recent post](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/y8buag/is_cashfusion_dead_what_happened_and_how_do_we/) discusses it too.

The goal of the campaign is to create a second, parallel CoinJoin wallet, in order to give BCH users a second choice when needing to protect their financial privacy.

I'll be attending the BCH22 conference in St. Kits. I look forward to talking with members of the BCH community there about this project.

If this project does not get funded, I'll be bummed but OK with that. From watching this Reddit sub and the Telegram channels, it seems to me that many users are frustrated, and desire an alternative CoinJoin tool. If that desire can be expressed as funding for this project, then I'm happy to build the tool they need.

This campaign also seeks to build the CoinJoin protocol using a modular architecture. The modular architecture would make it easy to implement the protocol into mobile apps, web apps, and all kinds of BCH apps.",9,btc,2022-10-21 00:54:29

y9rfze,gotificial,13,https://redd.it/y9rfze,‚ùì Question ,What are the real thinking of Americans about censorship? I am confused.,"I have one question. I would be very grateful if you could reply. (I didn't post this question on r/defi or r/CryptoCurrentity because I thought I could get a fairer answer here.)

Even if Ponzi schemes, money laundering, and tax evasion do occur, it is argued that censorship should be ""completely"" eliminated because the benefits of decentralization, autonomous -organization and anonymity are greater. For example, they say tornado cache should be legalized.

What I wonder is the purity of these arguments. At first, I thought that those who made this claim were only making that claim to protect their money because their money is currently invested in DeFi. However, if I listen carefully to their stories, it may sound like they are making such claims based on their own reasonable reasons, regardless of their interests. I became confused.

If I were an American, I would be able to grasp the truth of the argument, but unfortunately I am a South Korean. So I made a questionnaire as follows.

Assuming the American population is 100,

1. The percentage of people who need an adequate level of censorship to prevent tax evasion or money laundering
2. The percentage of people who argue that censorship should be abolished altogether. And among these,

a. The percentage of people who make such an argument in a pure state based on their conscience

b. The percentage of people who claim to do so because their money is currently invested in Crypto

y9s0ql,AD1AD,1,https://redd.it/y9s0ql,None,It's Fusion Friday!,"#October 21 2022 announcement:

You may have had problems getting fusions recently. If so, first make sure you have updated your CashFusion server settings! There was recently a server change and, while new installs will default to the new server, if you ever touched those settings yourself then they will stay the same for you when you update. (So you'll need to do it manually.) Please do double check!

Server: fusion.servo.cash
port: 8789 SSL (**not 8788 like old server**)

There have also been issues that may or may not be related to the server change. People are experiencing lots of timeouts, SLL connection errors, and failed Fusions. Anecdotally, it does seem like having a fast, wired internet connection and turning off your VPN can help reduce these problems.

If you notice you get the connection error with the little red mark on the CashFusion logo, try unchecking ""use tor proxy at..."" in your proxy settings until the mark goes away, then re-check the box.

_______________

CashFusion is a tool that helps keep your Bitcoin Cash transactions private. Your finances are your business, and no one else's!

Over 11 Million Bitcoin Cash has already been made private using this innovative protocol:

https://stats.cash/#/fusion

https://fusionstats.redteam.cash/

You could leave CashFusion running all week if you want. This post is just a weekly reminder.

#New to CashFusion? No problem, getting set up is pretty easy =)

First, [download the Electron Cash desktop wallet](https://electroncash.org/). It's got CashFusion built in.

Set up your wallet, send it some Bitcoin Cash, and then activate CashFusion by clicking the icon in the lower right:

https://i.imgur.com/Wz6qrmM.jpg

Once it's activated, your wallet will start ""fusing"" the Bitcoin Cash it contains. That is, it will start mixing your coins with other CashFusion users.

""Fusions"" happen over time as their own transactions. Each fusion transaction will include *some* of your coins\*, so it will often take multiple fusion transactions before all the coins in your wallet are fused. Check ""spend only fused coins"" on the send tab if you want Electron Cash to prevent you from sending funds that haven't been made private yet.

(When you receive new coins, or you receive change from spending a fused coin, your wallet will automatically add them/it to the queue of coins to be fused. Remember, this happens over time, so there will be a delay between when you receive new coins and when they are fused and ready to spend privately!)

Electron Cash can keep fusing your coins forever, or it can aim for a certain number of fusions for each of your coins and then stop. Toggle this setting and choose the target number of fusions by right clicking the Fusion icon and then choosing ""CashFusion Wallet Settings"".

Here's the [CashFusion Telegram group](https://t.me/cashfusion) where you are welcome to ask questions. (Remember to be courteous!)

Happy Fusing <3

\*""Coins"" are kind of a confusing concept when it comes to Bitcoin, but you can think of them just like discrete ""bills"" (or... ""coins"") in your wallet, but instead of coming in only certain sizes like $1, $5, $10, $20, etc, they can be any amount sent to you in a previous transaction, like 0.618 BCH, 0.000001 BCH, or 123.45679 BCH.

What if Bitcoin was never supposed to hit 60k? Hear me out! What if govs, corps, and tutes in general had the idea to rule the world by making us servants and by making us rent to never be owners of anything. And the only way to do accomplish that was by making a boatload of money! But there wasn't really a way to make easy money bc their drug trading, human trafficking money  (most profitable) just wasn't fast enough! So they decided to look for something to make money quick! 

And that's BTC! Why? It was a growing commodity with a very big following. Because nobody really trusted the regular money markets anymore AND SEC, FINRA etc had no authority over it. Easy money bc it's not illegal so there's no hiding behind it, there's no questions asked. Then they just slowly pump it BUT also not too fast as to not scare away people that see it growing too easily. Not 6o seem like one of those ""too good to be true"" scenarios. Perfect! Plan is set in motion. The govs, corps, tutes, etc. begin pumping it, and they run it to 20k as an experiment. They made so much money but they just needed 1 more BIG one to have so much more money. Money that they need to buy a ton more land so they can rent out to more people and have more power by having more money. 

How should they do that? Ah, lightbulb moment! Start or wait for  a situation so grave that it stops people from working so that people can't make money thus money is no longer moving around so much. How will we have more money? Bang, turn on the money printers! They can print out so much damn money, they put a lit into Bitcoin to run it to 69k (nice) and they pull out reeaaallll slowly to not scare anyone, paying people to give us false hope that it'll go back up.

I ask this question because the main reason people are buying BTC is because they believe that the price will go up infinitely or at least for a long time.

But what if the price no longer goes up?
Would people still buy BTC?
Why or why not?

What if there are too many users on BTC network that it‚Äôs almost impossible to do transaction within a reasonable timeframe?

For example, if 8 billion people all want to use BTC, it would take years, if not decades, to do transactions for each and every user on a daily basis. The block size is too small and can‚Äôt possibly scale.

With that fact in mind, the only possible future for BTC would be to die because there‚Äôs no utility once it becomes the ‚Äústore of value‚Äù for mankind like it always claims to be.

If BTC price is decided to be stable in order to avoid this outcome, then there‚Äôs no reason to invest in it because there are hundreds of other investments to choose from that would go up in price.

## NFT Creator
NFTs are the future of digital assets. They can represent anything from concert tickets, to works of art, to news items, to membership in a club, to just about anything you can imagine. Creating NFTs needs to be cheap and easy. This app let's you create an NFT in a few seconds for only a few cents of BCH.

## NFT Collector
What good is it to create NFTs if you can't show them off?!

The NFT Collector app will display any NFTs held by a Bitcoin Cash address. The address can be passed as part of the URL, which makes it easy to share on social media. Here is an example address with a collection of different types of NFTs:

## BCH DEX
FullStack.cash and the [Permissionless Software Foundation](https://psfoundation.cash) are in the process of building out a decentralized exchange (DEX) for trading tokens. These DEX's can be used to buy and sell fungible tokens and NFTs. The protocol we've developed is trustless, atomic, non-custodial, and peer-to-peer. These are important qualities that distinguish it from other DEXs in the industry. Learn more by visiting the demo.

token burning: I've heard people started burning tokens just to be able to earn a specific transactions within' the proof of burn method, but generating tokens is currently impossible without owning at least some small amounts of crypto coins (ETH in particular) and using a weaker computer to generate them so what's the alternative? 

NFT minting: currently you need to have at least some smaller amounts of crypto tokens in your wallet and it is impossible to start profiting as a total beginner in the first place. Gas fees aren't ETH, possibly there are other ways various blockchains implement their own versions of NFTs but I haven't checked them (possibly they are structured in the same way).

running a lightning node: possibly the most practical way to earn passive income (even the tiny nation of El Salvador uses them). I don't care if it's not profitable but the catch is that most software used to manage lightning nodes are on ARM and not on x86, I wonder how possible is it to run and build your own scripts from scratch on x86\_64 computers.

setting up a custodial wallet: you could theoretically start your own custodial wallet in order to host other people crypto assets in exchange for a fee. But it's not actually an easy thing to do since there would be problems by others trusting you and your account, I guess there are indeed some kind of software capable of automating this process on either linux or windows, but I ain't currently aware about them.

announcement mining: possibly one of the most ""esoteric"" forms of mining I've ever heard at the moment. you don't mine for blocks, you mine the so-called ""announcements"" from your computer. I only ever seen it being used in PKTcash and nothing else.",2,btc,2022-10-23 19:47:41

Since the recent price crash, many BCH holders have not moved or sold their coins since they feel the price is undervalued.","71% has not been moved in 6 months, 82.5% has not moved in 3 months, and 92% has not moved in the past month.

https://messari.io/asset/bitcoin-cash/metrics/all

The price has moved quite low with very few of the long term BCH holders getting involved in trading. 

In other words the recent price action is just noise during an illiquid time for all crypto markets and does not reflect what investors feel their BCH is worth. As a result it is not possible to buy much BCH even though the price says it is extremely cheap.

Lastly futures are trading tens of millions of paper BCH while the actual market barely has a small fraction of that traded on spot markets.

eg. a person/people market sell 500k BCH and want $50 million dollars cash right now, but no one is under an obligation to give it to them, maybe if they sell more slowly in line with demand they can have receive a much better price in line with what other market participants think it is worth. But when you market sell you are willing to take low prices, and thats what they chose to do.

TLDR: There are millions of BCH, but say someone market sells 500k BCH which temporarily crashes the price, that doesnt mean the other BCH holders will also market sell their holdings, and the metrics show that they are not.",27,btc,2022-10-24 01:46:26

yc9ods,TheWorldofGood,15,https://redd.it/yc9ods,ü§î Opinion,I don't understand why BTC should be a store of value,"BTC cannot and should not become a store of value for the world, because BTC can't possibly scale without resorting to the centralized Lightning network which defeats the whole purpose of a peer-to-peer cash system. Look at El Salvador's Chivo experiment. It was a complete failure where most people didn't use BTC even though the government gave them free money and free app to use it.

The centralized solution known as Lightning doesn't work and shouldn't work if you are for decentralization where regular people rule, not the people who own the Lightning network.

Another reason is that the more users BTC has, the slower and more inefficient it becomes. This kind of technology can't possibly survive in the future where more users would mean worse user experience. For example, if YouTube or Twitter slows down every time it gains new users, all the users would leave for a better, faster product.

Also, the vast majority of the world population does not think that BTC is a store of value. It's the opposite of gold which is universally recognized as a store of value for thousands of years. Unlike BTC, the number of users don't affect the nature of gold at all.

Just because Michael Saylor says BTC is a world store of value, doesn't make it come true. In order to become a SoV of the world, it needs to be functional and not inefficient with a growing number of users. BTC won't be functional if it has billions of users even with Lightning. Its small block size make it impossible to scale, which means that it's not for the billions of users around the world. If it has to resort to the centralized solution like Lightning, BTC is just another tool of the government to control its general population.",4,btc,2022-10-24 12:15:13

So by buying the coins off the small amount of sellers the price recovers much more than you would think due to upwards slippage.

and yes they are reasing 140k bch worth a whopping 14M...literally nothing on crypto markets.

TLDR:

**Downside: 14M dollars worth of BCH is sold.**

**Upside: some of the 3 billion dollars worth of Bitcoin gets converted to BCH.**",7,btc,2022-10-25 01:31:19

Then I got an email about a price change. (This happens relatively often, supposedly because it's hard for Purse to estimate exactly how much things like tax and shipping will be.) The $1.59 changed to $7.80. That would mean that the sales tax was almost 30%, which would be crazy high.

I contacted support, and the response I got was worrying. They said ""This is the tax price of your order in Amazon."" and sent this picture:

https://imgur.com/a/TWmQPJU

But as you can see, the order they showed there included a $114 Apple TV which was NOT in my order.

When I pointed this out, the support representative said ""the system added an item by mistake to the calculation, I will report the issue to the dev team"" and they adjusted the tax amount for my order to $0.96.

So that's all fine and good, but how many Purse.io shoppers have been paying extra tax because of this kind of ""mistake""? The amount added to my order was more than I was saving by using Purse in the first place!

yg1pou,gotificial,7,https://redd.it/yg1pou,None,Eco-friendly Bitcoin,"This is the age of POS. However, there is a person who is looking at the POS with suspicious eyes in the SEC. Of course, this is clearly paranoia. This is because there is no risk of damaging investors at all. In other words, it is completely different from TerraLuna's anchor protocol.

I feel that the way the U.S. controls cryptocurrency is very contradictory. This is because anyone with a normal mindset should look at POW worse than POS. However, the Howey Test ended up with a bizarre result, with the condition ""Any profiteering comes from the effects of a third party."" As a result, while completely wasteful methods are legal, they are trying to outlaw ways that are environmentally friendly and do not pose risks to investors at all. Bitcoin mining is a comedy, but the Howey Test praising it as legal is also a comedy.

How long will we be watching the comedy? In a world where even POS is considered a sin, should coins be completely gone? Is there a smarter way to mine? So what I came up with is a donation coin. This is a completely different concept from Australia's donation coin.

The mining of bitcoin ends in 2040. Even before that, it will end when 21 million are mined. But we cannot wait until then. Suppose that the mining of Bitcoin is over at this moment. And based on this status, donation coins are issued.

Donation coins are issued based on the amount of electricity or price input when mining one bitcoin. For example, under the current circumstances, one coin will be issued for $10,000 to $15000. However, the money is donated. It's like donating a power plant to a country in Africa. Donations are actually used to build power plants. To clarify the causal relationship, it is like donating the electricity required for mining to underdeveloped countries, not meaninglessly exhausting it.

It is the same as current Bitcoin system that the amount of donations increases as the amount of mining increases. However, there is no limit to the mining. Coins can be mined endlessly. However, since the donation price also rises, the coin price rises as the amount of coins increases.

Donation management can be left to DAO or large offline accounting firms. Anyone can create a blockchain platform. Preemption will be important in this case.

How about it?

ygn6rw,gotificial,13,https://redd.it/ygn6rw,None,BitcoinGreen,"I was encouraged by the enthusiastic criticisms, oppositions, neglects, ets., and tried to move my thoughts forward. The previous article is as follows.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/yg1pou/ecofriendly\_bitcoin/](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/yg1pou/ecofriendly_bitcoin/)

I am a mainnet developer. But there is no greed. I'm writing this out of curiosity. I am writing this article with the idea that it is for nature. Even not sincere.

Bitcoin Green is hard forked from Bitcoin Core. It's 1 + 1 method. The difficulty of mining is set to zero. However, additional approval for donations must be obtained from DAO. This method is made with a smartcontract. It's not that hard to make.

In this case, you will pay donations and receive coins. It can be received in cash, but in the beginning, it will be convenient to receive it in other cryptocurrencies. 

Donation prices are competitive. The person who pays the most gets a coin. Donations are managed by a reliable accounting firm. Donations are used to fund power plants in poor countries around the world, or to subsidize electricity bills for poor people, even in areas where electricity comes in. Thus, environmental destruction becomes environmental friendly.

The minimum donation limit increases according to certain principles. If the failure of bidding continues more than five times, the minimum will go down. This is also the method BCH adopted in terms of difficulty.

The upgrade through the hard fork can be performed freely. With the exception of data, the code can also be replaced with something completely different. For example, it means that Bitcoin can be converted into Ethereum. Namely, there is no technical limit to the upgrade. That only affects the time and cost spent. Therefore, the limit of 21 million can also be changed to unlimited. This is a very easy task and rather desirable. This is because coin prices can be raised indefinitely in the long run. At the same time, the human environment and the lives of the poor - theoretically - improve infinitely.

It is not desirable to perform many upgrades at once. For now, this is enough. In the case of the following hard fork, it is considered desirable to change the consensus algorithm and eventually remove the concept of the block, and develop it into Bitcoin, which Satoshi aspired to be a means of payment in real life.",0,btc,2022-10-29 15:55:43

yihr7o,gotamd,33,https://redd.it/yihr7o,üìö History,"The 1MB Block Size Limit was Carefully Chosen, is Perfect, and Should Never be Raised","I was told today that the 1MB block size limit was carefully chosen by Satoshi when he implemented it in 2010. It took some thinking, but I now believe this to be the case. Please hear me out.

You see, in 2010, the average block size was approximately 0.0MB and transactions were generally free. Satoshi knew that eventually someone would take advantage of this situation to start spamming the network, so he had to choose a block size limit. But how to choose?

Well, Satoshi carefully considered the world and the rapid pace of technological advancement, and he decided that 1MB was the perfect limit not just in 2010, but for the entire future of the universe. Why, you might ask? It's simple, really. You see, he figured that Bitcoin needed to be resilient in the case of a worldwide internet collapse. In such a case, Bitcoin would rely on a sneakernet to survive. Satoshi knew that the 3.5"" floppy disk was the pinnacle of sneakernet technology, as we see in the movie ""Hackers.""

Anyway, 3.5"" floppy disks only hold 1.44MB of data in their ""high density"" incarnation. A silly company called iomega attempted to improve floppy disk technology using Zip and Jaz drives, but these were terribly unreliable failures. The 1.44MB 3.5"" floppy is truly the best and only storage medium that can be counted on.

Satoshi also knew that actually putting 1.44MB worth of files on such a disk was impossible due to formatting and other requirements, so he had to keep the limit somewhat lower. Thus, the 1MB block size limit was born. Satoshi knew that in the future, technology would develop to the point where we would be able to transport 3.5"" floppy disks anywhere in the world in under 10 minutes.

It's now clear to me that the 1MB block size limit was carefully chosen to align with the pinnacle achievement of technology: floppy disks transported around the world in under 10 minutes. And we haven't even gotten there yet! Have you tried to transport a floppy disk from the North Pole to the South Pole in 10 minutes? This is where we should really be focusing our scaling efforts. People need to be able to bootstrap and run full nodes in the arctic circle using just a Raspberry Pi and a 3.5"" disk drive.

I hope you all now see the light and can understand the masterful logic behind Satoshi's choice of a totally-not-arbitrary 1MB blocksize limit in 2010.",13,btc,2022-10-31 17:03:35

Hey guys. I'm here proudly launching [Trocador.app](https://trocador.app/) 's API System as promised.

API Docs: [https://trocador.app/en/docs/](https://trocador.app/en/docs/) (login needed)

Now anyone can create an account and receive an API Key and monetize websites, as well as mobile apps, personal projects such as trading algorithms, etc. The API was tested and is working well over both clearnet and TOR (for better privacy), so any kind of project can be monetized. With this system, you can get quotes and create transactions on any of our listed exchanges, always getting the best rate at that moment, and you don't pay extra for this: our rates are the same you would find on each individual exchange.

If you are not into programming, but have a website, you can also monetize it by copying and pasting the widget HTML tag inside your project. We have also tested the widget on [Moneroj.net](https://moneroj.net/), which can be seen on the main page there. It's Javascript-free.

***Next Steps)***

Looking back these last weeks since the launch, we had hundreds of successful trades with no reported issues whatsoever, so I'll assume we have served well our clients. Bitcoin Cash is certainly one of the most used coins on our website. The KYC rating feature, which we added last week, is very useful to warn users about each exchange's policy so they can take the best decision possible before each trade. As for the future, we look forward to:

* create partnerships with other projects, wallets and websites;
* list new exchanges (to provide better rates);
* list more coins;

BCHG (OTC) shares has a 36% discount to spot BCH price.,"Many who own BCH dont know that there are high paying Yields for this crypto currency. 

**Option 1:** 

https://www.gemini.com/earn

There are many traders who are paying top dollar to Borrow BCH and play the markets (gamble basically). They either make way more than their interest rate, or lose way more.

If you dont know how to play the markets, you can take the safer option and lend for interest, to Genesis through Coinbase earn for 5.5% (5.33% daily interest, cumulatively is actually 5.5% if you dont withdraw your earnings)

Pros: Easy to withdraw. Daily interest. Very liquid.

Cons: Rate can change, either higher or lower in the future.

**Option 2:**

https://grayscale.com/products/grayscale-bitcoin-cash-trust/

Ticker: BCHG an OTC stock run by grayscale. They are holding BCH on Coinbase custody, and are selling BCH 36% below their face value. This is because for now they are not allowing the BCH to be withdrawn, they are trying to convert it to an ETF which would allow withdrawals, or they can simply enable withdrawals in the future if they choose to do so (Im not sure why they arent already).

This rate is 6 and a half times the yearly interest of Gemini earn. So if it becomes an ETF before 6.5 years you still get paid the full yield. 

Pros: 6.5 years of 5.5% locked in even if they allow withdrawals earlier, then you just take it out and lend it somewhere else for more interest. Rates cant drop because its locked in.

Cons: to withdraw your profits, they have to either become an ETF, or enable withdrawals, or the market price has to reach parity with spot. You are assigning a 6.5 year window for this at a 5.5% interest rate. If its longer it might have been better to just lend elsewhere",0,btc,2022-11-01 16:47:33

yltlmp,LovelyDayHere,9,https://redd.it/yltlmp,ü§î Opinion,Just like an unhappy married couple can come to consensus to split up... (and move on),"Bitcoin in 2017 came to a consensus to split up, after years of BTC small block supporters telling the on-chain scaling supporters to fork off and rejecting their proposals to raise the block size (even to 2MB).

This is history now, but I want to emphasize the fact that the split was a kind of meta consensus (at the level of both sides of the community).

This option was always built into the design of Bitcoin and its release as open source software.

There could have been many other issues that may have forced such a split, such as

- BTC developers going rogue and confiscating some funds (e.g. Satoshi's stash) for their own development compensation, or on behalf of some 3rd parties

- BTC developers tabling changes to eliminate Bitcoin's fixed supply of 21M coins

- Bitcoin developers trying to take it proprietary via ""closed source"" or patents on protocol algorithms

- Bitcoin developers suggesting to price out the majority of the world's users by making transactions on the system become unaffordable for the general population

- Bitcoin developers changing away from Proof-of-Work to something like Proof-of-Stake

- Bitcoin developers introducing blacklists, miner ID, or other regulatory control handles that would turn Bitcoin into a permissioned system

I'm sure there are a multitude of other possibilities, but it happened to be that a temporary design decision made by Satoshi for spam protection in the early days (where it cost basically nothing to spam the network) was turned into a quasi permanent feature by the Bitcoin developers, leading to chain congestion, high fees, and stifling of adoption.

My point here, it is legitimate to get a divorce or if you disagree fundamentally with the life choices your partner / peer is making, as we did disagree with the notion that BTC should only be a settlement layer and that the Lightning Network could be a workable replacement for the quality of payment experience that Bitcoin could offer (even back in 2015).

We have a working peer to peer electronic cash system in BCH. The world needs this.

Let's move on with building a bigger network.",18,btc,2022-11-04 09:15:38

ymecz3,Shibinator,41,https://redd.it/ymecz3,üõ†Ô∏è Services,My review of the Kim Dotcom CashRain demo,"Just got a chance to try out the Kim Dotcom CashRain beta.

A couple of screenshots I quickly took of the site: https://imgur.com/a/TgeBfs0

My thoughts:

Kim made some big promises last year and earlier this year, after getting excited about BCH and making several public statements about it, but then failed to deliver either his planned FileSharing site (K.im) or the viral social media site (CashRain).

Both seemed to be vapourware. The community felt let down, but we've seen it before so for the most part expectations had already been tempered by a sense of ""I'll believe it when I see it"".  This proved wise, as it seemed increasingly likely that these products were vapourware that were never going to see the light of day.  Announcements and hype on Kim's part trailed off into nothing.

Fast forward six months to today (November 4 2022), and suddenly Kim announces a surprise Twitter space and private beta for CashRain. Maybe that's just software dev, things always take longer than expected. 

So what is CashRain and how does it work?

Essentially the site is like a ""reverse donation"" or ""mass airdrop"" or ""mass chaintip"" tool. To start with, you sign in by scanning a Bitcoin.com wallet QR code (although in future it would be nice if more wallets were supported, aka the ability to just enter a generic BCH address).  Then you pick a name, email and password like signing up for most websites.  This puts you on a page where you can join communities or look at the leaderboard.  

The demo only had 2 communities, the Kim Dotcom community and the CashRain community but presumably in future either a limited set of approved influencer people, or perhaps just any user, can create their own.  Anyone in a community can ""rain"" (aka donate) BCH to the rest of the community.  So let's say a big streamer can donate 10 BCH to all of their CashRain followers.  But also, any member of the community can also donate to all of the others too, so it's kind of a big festival of donations / tipping.  Sending donations is fun and ranks you up on the leaderboard (I guess it might help to build notoriety or status by being a charitable person) and receiving tips is fun of course because you're getting free money and you get little dopamine inducing notification pop ups on your screen (or by email, or in your BCH wallet), similar to how noise.cash works.  This is a pretty genius strategy, because it also reminds me of how Bitcoin (and later Dogecoin) were going viral initially on Reddit back in 2014-2015, with people using the Reddit crypto tip bots (which later got banned from most subs for being unasked for and spammy).  CashRain is like that, but only for people who opt into it, and across EVERY social media platform to large groups of followers.  The payout from a donation is not uniform across the community, it is staggered so that 1 user gets a big payout (the ""Jackpot""), a bunch get a smaller payout, a big pool get a microtip of a few cents, and if you're unlucky or the donation wasn't very big then you miss out on that rain but you can maybe get some in the next one.  Individual users can increase their chance of getting rain by linking up to their various social media accounts, which then check to see that you follow the Community leader's page (so Kim in this case).  In other words, this is a way for influencers to not only reward their fans and spread BCH, but also to indirectly pay for social media follows.

The other page in CashRain beta Leaderboard shows most ""rained"" communities or users, aka the communities which have received the most BCH or the users that have donated the most BCH.

The site was pragmatic, but actually very advanced for a beta product, and the UI looked clean and slick.  Linking to a social media site like Twitch or Twitter was slick and worked flawlessly.  This definitely doesn't play into the cypherpunk privacy centered ethos (there's no KYC, but it does essentially involve linking to your social media accounts, although those can be pseudonymous of course).

I didn't hit on any bugs when using the site. The incentives certainly seemed well aligned, I liked using the product, it was really fun even in its beta state just donating a few satoshis and briefly appearing on the leaderboard, and I can definitely DEFINITELY see this going mega viral with the Twitch under 25 crowd.  All it takes is 1 influencer getting excited about it, and it can set off a mega chain reaction.

Kim said he expected an open beta to be ready in the next 30 days.  With the rate of delivery on previous promises, that might be optimistic, but I can believe 30 days is realistic with how bug free and functional the site I saw today was.

I didn't catch the entire Twitter call, but I did get about the last 10 minutes or so.  Kim was taking feedback from the listeners who were pointing out a few things that could be tweaked and improved, like adding Odysee to the list of supported social media sites (along with Twitter, Twitch, Youtube, Instagram).  One listener asked about how the site is protected from bots, and the developer (I think?) of the site said that they would implement some kind of bot filtering or account checks to minimise that (my opinion: even a simple filter like only accounts of a certain age and with certain activity patterns could already cut out most bots, so this seems fairly manageable especially in an app that encourages linking to multiple social media platforms). Kim also talked about hoping to scale up to hundreds of millions of cash rain tips per day, and although this is a big ambition and only time will tell whether it comes true, the demo certainly felt like it had that potential.

Still no word on the filesharing app K.im, but 1 out of 2 ain't bad especially when CashRain seems so promising so I'll take it.  And who knows maybe K.im also pops out in a useable state when its least expected.

Overall: 9/10 private beta experience, and I am very very excited for this launching for real.  BCH has been crushing it on the technology / protocol front, but a lot less on the user adoption, virality, user interface and social media angles - and this can potentially do a TON of good in that area.  Hopefully the open beta is out soon so more people can be involved!

St Kitts conference coming up and lock in for May 23 upgrade CHIPs as well, November looking like a good month for BCH.

I'm going to bed now but I will try answer if there are any questions in the comments tomorrow.

Edit: Kim [has announced](https://twitter.com/KimDotcom/status/1588688644139028480) that the encrypted file site K.im is also ready, and is waiting on some suitable infrastructure. Amazing news, hopefully we'll see some output from that soon.",76,btc,2022-11-04 23:51:26

Despite initially falsely denying exposure with fancy technical lawyer speak. Withdraw your loans to them, we dont know how deep this really goes or if they are solvent anymore.","**Todays new admission to losses numbering at least in the hundreds of millions**: https://twitter.com/genesistrading/status/1590836594382032896

>As part of our goal in providing transparency around this week‚Äôs market events, the **Genesis derivatives business currently has ~$175M in locked funds** in our FTX trading account. This does not impact our market-making activities.

Previously: Nov 8, 2022:

>With regard to today‚Äôs market events, **we have managed our lending book and have no material net credit exposure**. In addition, Genesis has no exposure to any tokens issued by centralized exchanges. We continue to meet the needs of our clients around the world across all products.

https://twitter.com/genesistrading/status/1590106896698028032

Nov 9, 2022 :

>We want to provide an update on where things currently stand with our lending business. In anticipation of the extreme market volatility yesterday, we hedged and sold collateral **resulting in a total loss of ~$7M across all counterparties, including Alameda**.

https://twitter.com/GenesisTrading/status/1590391027214725120

**Below is an analysis of their tweet information that was posted on reddit on the 9th of November when genesis was still being deceptive about their losses** (Link to  the Previous Reddit thread: https://old.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/yqq49d/after_denying_exposure_yesterday_today_genesis/):

>Genesis has no material exposure to FTT 

Translation: We have no direct exposure to FTT but our borrowers who have our money do have exposure to FTT.

>Genesis has no lending relationship with FTX

Translation: We have a lending relationship with Alameda which is the same thing as FTX.

>Genesis has a trading relationship with FTX, amongst other exchanges. Our exposure to FTX has no impact on our ability to serve our clients.

Translation: We do have trading exposure to FTX (most likely assets on the exchange that cannot be withdrawn due to insolvency) but we arent insolvent yet, unless all customers request their funds back from Genesis. And we still pay workers to come in and answer phones.

>our balance sheet remains strong

Translation: On paper we can use tricks to make it look like we arent insolvent yet even though we dont have the actual assets anymore and the borrowers have defaulted.

>95% of the collateral in our lending book is comprised of USD/stables, BTC, and ETH

Translation: However we gave many loans with no collateral at all, that were based on the balance sheets of the borrowers, who had FTT and other now worthless coins on their balance sheets which fooled us into giving them loans. Also when we do liquidate all our loans we will Dump ETH and BTC into oblivion because 95% of margin loans are backed by these 2 assets.

These guys are liars and dont want a bank run, which could result in their insolvency. Going from $0 to $7 million in losses, might not sound like a lot, the issue is that they are lying and hiding behind balance sheets backed by worthless stuff, even for example Alamedas balance sheet, which looks ""strong"" but was backed by FTT tokens. So while Genesis may deny having FTT on their balance sheet, they gave loans to balance sheets of other companies that were completely backed by fake printable tokens and are not saying how many millions, or hundreds of millions in losses they may be facing.",12,btc,2022-11-11 03:15:30

2. the exchange (ftx) is **alive**  .there are millions of users who trade there  . the revenue stream from trading fees is **alive** 
3. now the interesting part  - since FTX has filed for chapter 11 , ( essentially meaning they are bankrupt) , the gate is now open as to what will happen to the exchange ?  

i think other industry players like bitfinix, huobi , maybe even binance may step in and simply buy ( gobble) the troubled FTX  **for pennies** since the prospect of a running exchange with millions in trading fees is too lucrative to ignore ( ofcourse, this is after the dust settles)",0,btc,2022-11-12 08:51:52

You just put your crypto in your cold wallet ( ledger /trezor or harddrive) Then you get your 24 words seed phrase.

What happens if you lost your phrase? You can share your password with your friends, but this time you increase the risk of being stolen. I can reliably hide it with techniques that only I can decipher myself, but this time everything is gone when I die. The way to be able to inherit my savings must be clear.

There are probably many solutions, but the superficial articles I've read on the internet do not give any idea other than to write on paper with a ballpoint pen and keep a secret fire-proof safe.

Is there a consept or method to share your main seed phrase with the people you trust without sharing entire password. For example, you share it with 10 people but only if 3/10 people can come together, they can solve it or they will find the instructions to solve it.

Most of my family or friends are not crypto friendly, so even if they know their part, they might not reach the money. It would be a good idea if they can come together, collaboratively get the instructions step by step.

Which is hilariously true unfortunately.

This has been made possible either through incompetence or just malicious negligence? But it doesn‚Äôt matter regardless.  

The public has made up their mind.

Regulators are limited in what can be done and it‚Äôs likely this is the path they will take. This will limit state currency liquidity to whitelisted OFAC compliant crypto and future CDBC‚Äôs that will only be allowed to be available on centralized exchanges.

Think of kraken and coinbase not only having to get a bank charter but to also be licensed like stock exchange, but of crypto involving the SEC in the listing application process like an etf.

The implications being that only .gov approved crypto will be listed. I seriously doubt they can deal with dex's other then banning their tokens completely from CEX for not stopping there participation in unregulated dex's at the protocol level. 

It‚Äôs quite a bold move as this does not address potential unauthorized atomic swap type mechanisms between forks of similar coins, and there will always be a legion of forks. Also decentralized bridges is a problem for this, if ever made possible.

Either of these applied practically would render this moot for skilled individuals. However adoption by the general population would be set back for a while, which from what I can tell would be the point.

ywl03z,phoenixpriestess,0,https://redd.it/ywl03z,None,"When the function breaks, it's GAME OVER (Implosion Theory)","""The exchanges are owned by somebody. It's not a free open space. It's owned by somebody. Usually one person. The Russell 500 is a privately owned entity by a family. The NASDAQ is an owned market. One family owns the Toronto Stock exchange and London Stock Exchange. 

In the crypto space the problem is is that SBF is going to be seen as worse than Bernie Madoff, the mechanisms that these exchanges use to get you to purchase whatever it is that they were selling with your money, your fiat dollars, right? 

Because at the end of the day what's worth more right now? 48b in usd or 48b in X token? Which would you rather have?

You're gonna take the 48b. You'd be silly not to. When you look at the strength of the economic system, that's what it operates on right now.

The point is, it's the money. If they were selling tokens for dollars, that's the whole point. 

With FTX in order to sell these securities, because that's what they were deemed as, they had to have money in the bank. They didn't actually have money in the bank.

That's the problem. This is a microcosm of the bigger economic system.

99% of the projects are going to fail. Going to $0. After SBF/FTX it's going to be Tether. Once they find out what tether is all about that's going to blow the roof off of it all and BTC is going to plummet.

What's the point of doing this at the end of the day? To make money.

Why is SBF in this position? Why did he do what he did? 

Because if you're truly about being progressive and being a leader in society you're in charge of ""leading the industry"" and instead he ends up defrauding a lot of people, he plays a game of musical chairs that's basically a ponzi scheme, and he got caught.

The best part is is when they figure out that his influxes of cash came through Tether and that USDT is based on nothing, then a lot of people are going to be quite upset.

You have to understand how these exchanges in certain places, how they hold the money. 

This is the whole scam: you deposit $1K of USD on an exchange, and they give you credit on the exchange. And as soon as that happens, whatever numbers they show you - it doesn't matter. 

They can say you have $1K USD and then you go to transfer it into BTC, then exchange it into another coin, then another. 

All of that is a game. It doesn't matter. It's a well known scam.

The trick with this scam is, can you get your money out.

At some point when that function breaks, that's when it's game over. 

The system is this: you're entering a house. The key is that first door. Getting in is very easy. They take your money, easy, you get inside the house. And there are all your tokens. Convert your tokens here and there, high-yield interest rates here and there, it's all a smoke and mirrors show. 

It's when you want to exit, that's the issue.

What ends up happening is, as long as they are pulling in more revenue (which is the Ponzi scheme part), the more revenue they can dish out. 

That's what makes it look like a functional business.

The point is to turn a profit. As FTX got more and more money it started buying marketing rights here, put name here and there, work with Tom Brady etc. 

When that happens, the money flows in, some will flow out but ultimately most of it is to be converted into some token, into something, whether that token, has a name or is a number on the screen with very hard loopholes to get out of.

That's the problem. When these exchanges become insolvent is when they stop paying out. And when they stop paying out the money is somewhere else. 

It's gone. 

It becomes a supply and demand game. Part of the scam is, if you form a company and you offer those tokens and those securities do you ever actually hold the coin? No.

Unless you have a third party place to hold the actual cryptos. 

The problem is taking it out.

Binance has grown and grown and when they reach whatever amount they want to reach. If say it's worth 500 billion dollars, that means you probably have at least 10% sitting in cash. So then, you got $50b in cash, they could easily just cash out, shut down the operation, no one else cashes out. You get sued, if you get good lawyers maybe you'll pay $20b in cash, do seven years of time, then you'll get out with $30b after. And there's your heist. 

That's the tricky part is when these ""experts"" are turning out to be frauds. And the people with some economic sense have been looking at this like, it's a matter of WHEN. Not IF. 99% of crypto. 

It's going to evolve into something much more different, much more regulated. It's going to be like the stock market and they will all be viewed as securities.""",4,btc,2022-11-16 05:34:39

yws8lt,inegyio,5,https://redd.it/yws8lt,‚å® Discussion,I have backtested 15000+ variations of alternative trading strategies based on 5 years of historical data.,"I was playing around with a few popular alternative data APIs.

Some of them are:

* US Congress trades
* GitHub Commits
* Wikipedia Views
* Google Trends
* Sentiment on Reddit

I backtested different variations of them on 3-5 years of historical data.

I also calculated benchmarks for them.

I sorted them based on their performance in relation to the benchmark.

Here are the results. 

It seems that most of those strategies are there simply by chance, if you test a sufficiently large number of strategies some of them will just work.

Some of them definitely don't work, US Congress Members have 45 days to make their trades public.

Some of them seem to work, for example, GitHub commits. I do understand that the quality of the code cannot be judged by the number of commits, but perhaps developers are the first ones to know that the project is not going well and they lose interest.

The reason for my question here is that Roger and others have the nationality in the tax friendly jurisdiction of St. Kitts and seem happy with their choice (some others in Antigua like Calvin etc). I assume some of you, not in small numbers, also have the same citizenship.

By searching online, I was considering Antigua but it came up some serious bad news about the banking there

Anything that any one of you might want to say here will be helpful, you don't know but you will do serious good to a stranger that lurks around here for years (PM me to send me to some other forum more dedicated to this if that's better). Basically, all I want to do is to cash out some crypto and feel safe regarding the bank.

The St. Kitts SKNANB bank looks more professional and demands a lot of paper to open an account. Do you guys use that bank? What banks actually serve citizens of any of these islands?

Antigua looks like a good option for citizenship because of smaller price and faster processing times, but this link above made we severely weary of it now ...

yxnb7d,CryptoStrategies,70,https://redd.it/yxnb7d,None,Hayden Otto Statement on BitcoinCashCity.com Hijacking Attempt,"On November 16, 2022, the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) made a ruling in the dispute relating to my domain BitcoinCashCity.com. The Panel rejected the complaint, brought by Noel Lovisa, and I shall therefore retain ownership of my domain. The full decision can be read [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/15lZtvwWc0VkCuixcXnVj59jYmeMs5HrC/view?usp=sharing).

This was an egregious attack on me, an innocent domain name registrant, and I have been burdened with an expensive, time-consuming, and stressful defence of my lawfully registered domain name. Lovisa, in his attempt to take my domain from me, even filed incorrect sworn statements with WIPO and admitted to doing so after I called him out.
While I am relieved that the Panel saw through this, and correctly ruled in my favour in relation to BitcoinCashCity.com, there is no remedy for the cost and harm inflicted upon me.

Why Noel Lovisa, who is active in this subreddit, chose to use the ICANN UDRP against me is unclear, but in my opinion he was trying to hijack a brand that I established ([in March 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20190309235231/https://coinspice.io/news/north-queenslands-bitcoin-cash-city-living-on-and-using-cryptocurrency/)) and which I hold relevant social media profiles and domains for, Bitcoin Cash City. He has been using my brand, without my permission, to benefit and add credibility to his business Code Valley who intends to sell its product to the Bitcoin Cash community. I created Twitter and Facebook profiles, as well as registering the domain name, in the first half of 2019 and they were utilized for the 2019 Bitcoin Cash City Conference of which I along with my partner were the organizers. Lovisa was involved in that conference to the extent of providing bookkeeping and administration services through one of his shell companies. Lovisa now operates a ‚ÄòBitcoin Cash City‚Äô Reddit account created April 28, 2021, and a YouTube channel created May 7, 2021, but he needs the domain name to conduct a Bitcoin Cash City conference. He has been attempting to take my domain name, along with my YouTube
channel which contained recordings from the 2019 Bitcoin Cash City Conference, since December of 2021. That is when I first began receiving threatening letters from his lawyer, and despite attempts to appease him, have continued throughout this year. 

The WIPO decision is final, so who knows what Noel Lovisa will attempt next. All he can do is initiate proceedings against me in an Australian court, but that has not yet occurred despite repeated threats to do so. For certain he is conducting lawfare against me with the goal of expending my time and resources so that I cannot continue making videos, just as Craig
Wright has against Bitcoin Developers to stop them from writing code. I will not give in, and I hope that what I feel as harassment against me is condemned.",44,btc,2022-11-17 10:59:10

I have repeatedly tried to talk about the US governments belligerent behavior over and over in this industry, and how we were being long conned by deliberate politically motivated behavior by the agencies and by the State Department. Even most of Crypto twitter thinks SBF and FTX are feds.

I have been censored and banned from

r/Libertarian

r/Bitcoin

and now r/ethereum 

You know why the eth mods screwed me over you wanna know what finally got them to turn on me?

I merely made a title that said that Ryan Salame gave 23 million to the GOP for crypto lobbying

I never claimed what FTX did was not bipartisan, I never claimed it was only the GOP, and I did not post a paragraph with the article I linked. They dog piled me and got turbo butthurt for me criticizing a party, the republican party of all things.

We all know if you criticize the democrat party on reddit, you will get mobbed, brigaded, tattled on and banned by virtually every subreddit. We aren't that stupid and naive. So color me shocked that they did it from the reverse!

I turn to the Bitcoin Cash community because everyone else has censored me.

We all know the truth.

The bitcoin maximalist movement post 2020 is an opp., it's a State infested Opp that wreaks of establishment corruption and wallstreet cooption, and their party of choice is the GOP, they buy off senators like Cynthia Lummis and lawyers like Caitlin Long, pundits like Max Keiser, and get talking heads like Michael Saylor to push massive SEC backed regulations and state surveillance,

worse they are reaganite american exceptionalism, they are unequivocally american imperialist, they do not care about the developing world whatsoever, their politics are peak 1980s american expansion in the appliance of global FinRegs, the FinRegs are the arm of the US empire.

They are anti-cypherpunk and anti-libertarian

They openly threaten our industry with state regulations.

The Samurai developer and privacy and paynym advocates in Bitcoin hate them and believe they are feds. 

I personally believe Crypto Reddit and Reddit in general is doing deep deep deep harm to the cypherpunk movement, because of it's tendency to simply bandwagon establishment US politics and what effectively 'empire narratives', which includes Financial Surveillance and unquestioning obedience to the SEC. 

I tried to make a post in ethereum last night, and of course I'm banned/auto-modded, what I was going to explain are how criminal the fees are on american exchanges and the CME futures.

You're effectively not only banned from futures trading as a US citizen, you're also banned from day trading. The ECP law is a 10 mil requirement and the accredited investing law is 1 mil.

Without arbitrum and optimism and layer 2 fees, there is no hope for US citizens having fee parity with tradfi, literally no hope without defi.

&#x200B;

What do you think SBF and FTX and the regulators who he colluded with had intended with that Dccpa and regulated frontend for defi, what do you think they had intended with felonizing american citizens for using DeFi at all without collecting KYC when they passed the Infrastructure bill?

Rent collection. a monopolized front end where they can tack back on catastrophic fees onto optimism where you basically can't use anything. SBF was trying to destroy the liquidity on DeFi while USDC backdoored and rugged the rest of the liquidity by abandoning those protocols, because USDC is in bed with the State Department. 

You know what the fees for 100,000 dollars in notional size on micro bitcoin futures are? It's about 19 basis points round trip, compare that to deribit where it's only like 5 to 10% or binance is 2 to 8 percent. Or you can buy 1 contract for 20 thousand. It's not meant to be traded by retail, it's meant for HFT firms.

I'm genuinely not sure we can count on Vitalik or the Ethereum foundation and it's over proximity to american politics and venture capital to actually take a stand against this regulated DeFi front end stuff.

CZ saved this industry by standing up to the americans and blowing SBF up, without the asian markets we would be screwed.",19,btc,2022-11-19 15:12:02

Please don't take this in a hostile way I'm genuinely curious because I prefer GPU mining over CPU and ASIC for various reasons.

I do not like ASIC as I feel it is too centralised, it is too loud for my house, it is too hard to obtain, it is not an item that is in almost every house like a GPU... the entry barrier is way too high and tedious.

But they did have BCH trading pairs, for spot, futures and perpetual funds.

Now what they did was:

1) FTX shorts BCH below other exchanges spot and futures prices. - **WE SAW FOR MONTHS FUTURES WERE TRADING MULTIPLE % BELOW SPOT**.

2) Market makers **Deposit collateral onto FTX** to buy FTX's fake paper BCH at a cheap price and then short BCH at a higher price on other normal exchanges. This is **supposedly ""FREE ARBITRAGE""**. All they have to do is hold until the contract expiration, and they profit the difference in price between FTX and other exchanges.

3) FTX goes bankrupt. The market makers no longer have any long BCH positions because FTX never had any BCH, and instead the market makers only have short BCH positions on other exchanges.

4) If the price of BCH rises all these market makers stand to lose Hundreds of millions and get margin called and/or go bankrupt. 

5) Evidence: After FTX went bankrupt futures prices not only lost their negative premium but they actually have gone above spot ever since. That is evidence that FTX may have been behind this. To encourage traders to short BCH spot and buy FTX BCH paper futures for free 2-5%.

We know Binance and OKX trade against their own customers, these are the largest Futures exchanges. They might be the largest short positions as well because they cant be margin called on their own exchanges, so they really thought it was free arbitrage. This could explain why Binance had over 450k BCH liabilities but only 100K BCH: https://old.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/yrhvvt/binance_just_admitted_that_they_owe_611919_bch_to/

They might have bought 350k BCH on FTX and shorted the 350k BCH of their customer BCH deposits.

Now FTX is bankrupt and admitted they dont have any BCH, Binance owes their customers 350k BCH that they do not own anymore.

Just to give an easy example:

1) FTX sells BCH to $100 while other exchanges have BCH priced at $105.

2) Binance sees this and buys futures paper BCH for $100 and sells their customer deposits of BCH for $105. Now they have a paper $5 profit from this, if they can get their $100 BCH out of FTX when the futures contract expires.

3) FTX goes bankrupt. Binance loses the $100 BCH, but has the $5 profit left. Their debt is 1 BCH rather than $100 dollars though, so if they have to buy hundreds of thousands of BCH, each BCH might cost over $200-$300.

This information also explains why FTX Sam reached out to Binance and also OKX for funding. Those two are likely so deep in this fake arbitrage to FTX that their losses are easily billions, and with FTX going under, these two exchanges/market-makers are likely already insolvent.

TLDR: Because of the FTX collapse, **we are dealing with hundreds of millions in losses for market makers, plus these market makers owe actual crypto in debt/shorts due to hedging/arbitrage**. So the hundreds of millions of losses could easily double or triple.",43,btc,2022-11-20 02:46:04

z1dnst,wtfCraigwtf,12,https://redd.it/z1dnst,‚å® Discussion,Why These Ponzi Collapses and Exchange Defaults are GOOD for Crypto over the Long Term,"We've seen some amazing crypto price action this month after a period of calm and quiet. The FTX default was yet another stark reminder that crypto exchanges are corrupt to the core, and furthermore, they're antithetical to Satoshi's original vision for Bitcoin. Satoshi always intended for everyone to be their own bank, but then shady businesses like Mt Gox, Coinbase, Cryptsy, Binance, Quadriga CX, and FTX simply created a Banking 2.0 system on top of Bitcoin and lured people in with promises they didn't keep.  

Much of the mainstream public still believes that crypto is just a balance on their KYCed crypto exchange, they don't even know how to use a wallet! But this is changing quickly as more people get scammed by exchanges. When they hear ""not your keys, not your coins"", they don't understand the phrase, but they now know that they need to figure out wallets and practice self-custody to protect their wealth. On the whole, this is a huge development! More people taking their coins off exchanges means far less price speculation, bot trading, risk of defaults, risk of government seizures (coming soon to exchanges that haven't defaulted/exited...), and concentrated wallets filled with coins attracting hackers. One could argue that when crypto exchanges are obselete, crypto will be functioning in the way that was intended by Satoshi. The current Wall St speculative stock trading model for crypto could even be obseleted soon.  

People are also catching on that stablecoins and premined tokens are a scam. When someone is issuing a token, we all know to ask ""how is the supply created and who controls it""?, again this is something that is trickling down to the mainstream. Each time another stable shitcoin or token project craters, more speculative value is destroyed, leaving room for real value to grow organically. 

Now more than ever before, we need to EDUCATE THE MASSES about why crypto was invented and what the true purpose of it is and always will be: PEER TO PEER ELECTRONIC CASH!

This is still not sufficient to stop the FTX ""hacker"" from transacting the 228k ETH stolen from FTX wallets. I see several possible scenarios playing out:

* OFAC declines to blacklist the addresses because they are controlled by government actors or their buddies, possibly even SBF? In this case they are just sweeping everything under the rug
* OFAC blacklists the addresses, indicating the US government eventually wants to steal the coins 
* OFAC doesn't blacklist the addresses because they are waiting to gather the necessary force to completely take over ETH validation in a ""quick sweep"" operation

No matter what, this does not look good for the Ethereum network. Nonetheless I believe we may be able to extrapolate government strategies from this situation.

BTC Lightning was not a very good idea from the start, since it needs always-online watchtowers to prevent outdated channel closes. I find it more like RAM than a HDD, and I am skeptical it is fit for a currency database.

Without Lightning, Bitcoin can perform 7 TPS, or it takes about 9 years for a billion people to make 2 transactions. Clearly the block size is too small for worldwide adoption, [and the transaction fees confirm this](https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/median_transaction_fee-btc-eth-ltc-bch.html#log&alltime). $20 is a lot to someone in India spending $5/day.

On the other hand, the purpose of transaction fees (increased by transaction demand during limited supply) is to ensure security. Right now, to outspend Bitcoin miners it would cost [$589k/hr](https://www.crypto51.app/) - which is an absurd amount of security.

Very few people need to secure more than $589k/hr against doublespend. Of course, a doublespender like a fraudulent exchange could scam multiple people at once, so let's take a 10x margin, which would still give us $58.9k/hr.

In the mean time, Bitcoin Cash, due to its limited adoption and small fees, only costs $4.8k to double-spend. With our 10x margin, you can secure $480 by waiting 1 hour.

While BCH is is inferior right now if, say, you want to buy a $480k house (you'd have to wait 1000 hours = 41.66 days), with increased adoption it would be more secure (because a price increase would increase the block reward, and increased competition for block space would increase fees also).

Why has BCH price not grown? Not only did it fail to catch up with Bitcoin, but it actually lost 95% of value relative to USD in the since all-time high. I hoped it would come back, yet all we see in the top 50 is premined coins and pump-and-dumps.

Is it the (lack of) advertising? I see even Bitcoin.com is now shilling some VERSE token I've never heard of.

Is it the network effects? the value of a network increases with the square of its users, and as such, Bitcoin Core has a significant advantage.

Hi I've noticed that a lot of people on this sub are hesitant to get into Bitcoin in the fear that they'll lose their ledger, chuck paper into the bin etc.

The fundamental difference between this and the fiat system is custody over keys and one of the big barriers IMO is people being afraid to store their own keys. So I've come up with an ""insurance"" protocol for your keys.

Essentially, I want to know what people think about an open source protocol idea I have. Simply speaking its a way to back up your keys by encrypting them with information only know would know and then storing this on the blockchain.

A basic illustration could be, I could take my keys encrypt them with my bank details, passport number mothers maiden name etc. and store that (on chain). I would also have some record of what I have used for the encryption i.e.e mothers name bla bla bla.

Obviously the stuff you encrypt it with has to be stuff you won't forget in 50 years and that only you should know (I have a list of such things)

The motivation for this to have a copy of keys accessible should you lose a hardware wallet, change pc, metamask goes down etc or any black swan events like this - but it could be a good backup.

In theory, if this all comes together, there will a copy of your keys sitting immutably on some blockchain so you will never really lose your crypto if you lose your hardware wallet etc... in my head this would reduce some of the stress associated with holding your keys because you won't be worried you will lose them if you can always recover them. You can also store them more securely-i.e. you won't feel the need to put them in a notes app (which is important if you lose your HWW), because you can always get to your Bitcoin through this means.",0,btc,2022-11-23 13:53:07
z2zyzv,Shibinator,25,https://redd.it/z2zyzv,üì∞ Report,10 Thoughts from 2 weeks in St Kitts / BCH22,"I'm sitting in the SKN airport right now waiting for my flight out. As far as I'm aware, I think I'm the last international conference attendee to leave, although there's nothing significant about that, it's just a curiosity.

I thought it might be interesting to make a post with a few thoughts from spending time here with a bunch of other conference attendees and exploring the island.

1. ""Bad"" news first. Is St Kitts 100% (merchant) adopted?  No, not even close.  50% merchant adoption?  No, probably not that either.  If the criteria is narrowed to retail brick-and-mortar merchants in certain tourist heavy parts of the island?  Yes, with those caveats (ie drawing a selective perimeter), it's probably accurate to say 50% of those places accept BCH.  Silver lining: It's a non trivial area and they do actually accept BCH. Sometimes it might be more or less smooth (staff familiarity with accepting payments in BCH varies, sometimes the phone used to accept BCH isn't charged etc.), but in nearly all cases where the ""BCH accepted here"" stickers can be found it is possible to pay in BCH.  Staff or technology issues can be managed with a little patience and the staff are happy to facilitate, it's not a hassle or something they find frustrating even if it isn't totally smooth.

2. Several BCH22 attendees spent only BCH while here - no fiat at all.  Even if that was partly facilitated by sticking to the BCH accepting areas, I'd say that's very impressive and lives up to the ""100% adoption"" claim of the event from that person's point of view.  I didn't quite manage that (read: I was willing to bend a little for convenience), I used fiat on 1.5 taxi rides (I onboarded one of my taxi drivers, and they agreed to take half payment in BCH) and three or four times at the grocery store next to the hotel, but otherwise for me only BCH for nearly 2 weeks.

3. On St Kitts, BCH is Bitcoin.  It's a simple, uncontested fact. I was careful to specify ""Bitcoin Cash"" when I first arrived, but putting the ""cash"" part in meant sometimes the locals thought I was offering a choice with USD, so I stopped bothering with that and just said ""Bitcoin"".  Everyone knows exactly what you mean.  I expect this to play out similarly in other areas where BCH can build heavy, real-world adoption.  I only heard a local mention any other crypto, BTC, ETH or any other, one time when telling me that he was involved in speculating in different cryptos online.

4. The locals have a spectrum of opinions on BCH adoption, but for the most part are interested and curious.  No one I encountered was actively hostile to it.  As mentioned in point 3, everyone knows about it at least, and many are curious and will ask questions or give their opinion, clearly they are acclimatising to the idea.  I talked to a dealer at the casino and asked if they would accept BCH to buy in some poker chips and she said ""No we don't take it yet, but **it's just money**, so I don't see why we wouldn't.""  Her words unknowingly echoing the [""It's just money bro"" commercial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM4gNVme5a0) made me laugh, and it's very clear that people on the island understand the idea of BCH as a currency foremost (a natural conclusion from seeing the BCH accepted here stickers and people paying in BCH) and not as an investment.  

5. Of course, some (a minority) of locals are regular BCH users, mostly the ones close to the inflowing tourist satoshis or local BCH accepting businesses, but I expect that to spread outwards throughout the economy over time.  Many BCH tips were handed out by conference attendees, and locals who weren't interested in accepting BCH at a shop or as a tip would certainly have realised that doing so was directly costing them an opportunity they could have otherwise grabbed because those BCH politely and immediately flowed towards someone else nearby who would accept them.

6. In hindsight, the conference may have been timed very well at the bottom of the bear market.  Coins spent into the economy here were set at a low price, and when the price rises whoever still has some will feel very excited they do.

7. Groups of conference attendees and local adoption forms a kind of ""natural peer-to-peer DEX"".  At times where a venue would not accept BCH, one willing person could pay in fiat and all the conference people could pay them back in BCH, and even when the venue did accept BCH sometimes 1 person paid the tab and everyone else paid them back afterwards. This was of course smooth as butter between attendees from all around the world, and completely avoided the usual hassle of spare change, ""Do you have Paypal?"", ""Do you use split wise?"", ""What's your account number?"" that this kind of situation usually creates.  I also saw several instances of direct BCH for cash trades being made.  

8. In practice, internet connectivity tends to not be a logistical issue.  I was a little worried about this, but it actually was fine.  Internet on the island is pretty good, although occasionally has sudden dropouts.  I had a local SIM card with phone data provided by Sunny (thanks Sunny!) but for people who didn't or had run out of data, either the BCH accepting venues had their own free Wifi (great combo for merchants accepting BCH) or someone else in the group could provide a hotspot.  This combined super well with the point 7 about p2p exchange above.

9. The FTX disaster happening in the background was essentially a non factor in discouraging local adoption, because everyone is using non custodial BCH so is totally unaffected (except to the extent price was briefly down a little bit).  I heard some other tourists discussing it though, with one of the group doing a hamfisted job of explaining to his party the difference between FTX and the BCH adoption they were seeing around the island.

10. I'm really looking forward to coming back next year (BCH23!) and seeing how things progress.  It's hard to imagine adoption could ever go in reverse given the seeds of a circular economy and the locals overall friendliness to the concept, but who knows.  I can certainly see a bit of positive price action and/or a legal tender announcement leading to a lot of buzz and snowballing adoption fast.  Also, every day the people closer to the BCH economy will be getting a relative advantage that is absolutely certain and so it will become more prominent over time.

Great work by everyone involved on the ground here, I am very confident St Kitts has the highest per capita non custodial crypto adoption in the world. I think that's a fair summary and I'm sure other conference attendees can chime in with their experience in the comment section.  I will also discuss some of this on an upcoming BCH Podcast episode.",103,btc,2022-11-23 20:42:36

Genesis sold all their crypto loans and lent $575M to DCG to gamble on Bitcoin. The losses are past the loan amount. No collateral. No margin Call. WTF is happening. This is theft.,">On Tuesday, DCG founder and CEO Barry Silbert disclosed that DCG had a roughly $575 million liability to Genesis Global Capital, which is due in May 2023.

Source: https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/11/23/genesis-global-capital-confirms-hiring-investment-bank-moelis-talks-with-potential-investors/

The issue is that their 900M purchase of GBTC is worth only $426M. Which is less than the loan. There is no margin call option, but they are just letting DCG keep the remaining money WTFFFFFFFFFFFF???????? They are losing more money each day on their Bitcoin gamble , and they have no way repay the $575M loan.

They should be margin called today! Lenders are getting robbed, and if Bitcoin keeps going down, they will never recover their money due to Genesis and DCG negligence, intentionally giving loans to themselves with ridiculous terms that enable them to defraud lenders. Instead of doing anything, they have frozen all loaned funds. They are gambling at a crypto casino with this fraudulently obtained money.

Data: 

1) Jan 2021-August 2022: 46 million shares purchased for average price of $19.4 - total 898.34M

2) Today share price is $9.23 total value $426M	

3) Loan from Genesis $575M	

Data source for purchases and cost basis: https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/gbtc/sec-filings

TLDR: **Genesis gave non collateral loans for 575M to DCG and the loans are deep underwater way past normal insolvency/margin-call , yet they are doing nothing about it and just stealing all the lenders money. This is beyond fked.**",28,btc,2022-11-24 01:04:19

Coinbase company is only valued at 10B. They lose money every quarter, yet have more crypto and trading than any other exchange, its not even close. They are the real crypto exchange leader. 

And they have finally provided evidence that Binance is washtrading their exchange volume. Binance has max 25% of Coinbases volume, yet they fake their numbers to make it seem higher. Probably with fractional reserves and washtrading bots.

They even do promotions like 0 trading fees, to attract more funds, so how exactly are they even making money?

Most likely they directly trade against their customers. Additionally they likely are running some kind of ponzi like FTX did. **They dont need to charge trading fees to make their money, since they just want user deposits in order to sell their users' crypto for cash, and then gamble with the proceeds**. 

This is a ticking time bomb.

z44zed,SporeDruidBray,9,https://redd.it/z44zed,None,[poll] Community sentiment on introduction of weight units or BCH+Lightning future,"Question 1: Do you see merit in adopting a more complicated resource pricing scheme for blockspace consumption?

Question 2: Do you think both L1 and L2 transactions are viable and valuable in the far future, or are you an L1 purist? In 20 years time do you believe big blocks + lightning could satisfy global demands for a payment/monetary system?

Disclaimer/context:  
My background is in Ethereum research/ecosystem. I'm pretty interested in Bitcoin and I see a lot of value in big blocks. For a very high value blockchain I'm a fan of medium block sizes. I'm in agreement with Peter Rizun's analysis of SegWit having an unstable equilibrium, so while I like the refined resource pricing via weight units I'd prefer it's done via a hard fork. Rizun claims SegWit-compatible UTXOs are insecure since the softfork introduces weaker Data Availability for the extension blocks containing witnesses (signatures).

The Ethereum roadmap can be characterised as ""rollup centric"", focusing on L2s, and lightclient-optimised. Eventually full nodes will be heavier and lightclients will be lighter, with the vast majority of user tx occurring on L2.

One camp believes Eth should be favourable to L1 tx for eternity, since it will be more secure and censorship resistant than L2s. Another perspective is that L1 should be as light as possible and deprioritise features for L1 tx in favour of assisting L2s. I'm a fan of improving the experience of L1 users.

Hence I believe Ethereum should see an L1+L2 future rather than either L1 only or L2 only. I'm asking this question since I want my BTC views to be informed rather than just transporting over my ETH views to where they don't apply.

Most retail traders hold small amounts of BTC and don't want to move it around because it's slow and expensive to move (particularly during a bull run) therefore it makes sense that all major exchanges prefer BTC since the velocity is likely to remain low.

Apparently Binance were short on BCH so that would lend credence to the theory that exchanges don't like BCH because it's easier for them to be caught short if they use a fractional reserve business model/scam.

So is this a correct estimation of a 'conspiracy' to hold down BCH in favour of BTC? i.e. since it has faster, cheaper transactions than BTC, retail traders would withdraw more and make it less likely for a CEX to be able to get away with selling unbacked IOUs.",0,btc,2022-11-26 13:16:19

z7pzzo,grmpfpff,37,https://redd.it/z7pzzo,‚å® Discussion,Can Bitcoin mining decentralize and not centralize with increasing adoption over time?,"Can competition for more *participants*, instead for more *hashrate*, replace the current \[model and\] circles of causality that explain the increasing mining costs over time?

*When a new product is hitting the market, the price for it starts high and decreases over time with increased adoption and decreased production cost. Bitcoin mining instead is going the opposite direction. The more adopted it gets, the higher the price to participate in mining goes.*

Mining is becoming more expensive and as a result more centralized the more people get onboard Bitcoin, as predicted by Satoshi. What if it was the opposite though? Wouldn¬¥t it benefit not only to decentralize mining further over time, but also create an incentive for more people to get into the technical details of Bitcoin? As a result more people would mine, and more people would participate in development.

So the status quo is this circle of causality:

\- The *more entities invest* into mining, the *higher difficulty* gets

\-  The *higher difficulty* gets, the *more expensive* mining becomes

\- The *more expensive* mining becomes, the *higher prices* miners have to demand for their mined coins

\- The *higher prices* are demanded for each Bitcoin, the *more entities invest* into mining

&#x200B;

This circle is fueled by the limited amount of available Bitcoins:

\- The mining reward *decreases* over time

\- The cost for mining each coin *increases* over time

&#x200B;

This circle of casaulity continues in another spiral, since the ever decreasing amount of remaining Bitcoins increases the *pressure to invest timely* into Bitcoin mining for new investors.

\- this *pressure to invest timely* is coupled with the pressure to invest into *equipment that is on par* with existing miners

\- new miners entering with *equipment that is on par* pressures existing miners into *additional investments* to stay ahead of the new competition

\- the *additonal investments* of existing miners to stay ahead increases the *intitial investment treshold* for new investors

\- The ever *increasing initial investment treshold* increases the *pressure to invest timely* into Bitcoin mining for new investors

&#x200B;

The limited amount of available Bitcoins increases competition over the ~~existing~~ \[not yet minted\] Bitcoins. This pressure of competition causes mining for existing miners to become more and more expensive over time as each one becomes more and more invested in it to gain an advantage over the others.

Equally this raises the threshold for the initial investment for new investors who intent to start mining, that is needed to see a return of their investment in any chosen time frame.

That is why mining is becoming **more centralized** **over time**. Less and less entities are able to bring up the initial investment to mine competitively.

And just as a wink to the Bitcoin maxis, the infamous ""*cost to run a node*"" is absolutely irrelevant and just a gaslighting attempt to distract from the problematic of mining becoming irreversibly more centralized over time in Bitcoins current model.

Or is it? Is there a way to *decrease* the treshold for the initial investment over time without breaking the economic incentive that drives Bitcoins price up and drives more and more money into mining?

Can we flip the pyramid on its head? Instead of fewer and fewer miners investing a shitload to stay on top of the pack, what if mining became cheaper and cheaper and the competition would shift from *total amount of hashrate* to *total amount of participants*?

&#x200B;

z8067d,bobcatjamaica,26,https://redd.it/z8067d,üß™ Research,ORIGINAL RESEARCH: There was an attack on CRV price to get margin calls. It failed. But the same attack succeeded on BCH. Heres why and how to stop it.,"There was a recent attack on CRV that ultimately failed.

1) Attackers took out massive loans for CRV.


2) Attackers sold off the CRV to crash the price, so that those with loans for CRV: either long positions or collateral for backed loans, would get liquidated.


3) Attackers did not have enough CRV to sell, so the price did not go low enough, and then buyers bought up the tokens triggering a short squeeze, eventually the attacker got liquidated and lost all their collateral, which market bought the price of CRV to high prices. Even the CRV lenders/platform lost money since there wasnt enough CRV for sale, to market buy back the tokens.


**The recent attack on CRV did not succeed because the attacker did not have enough CRV to crash the price quickly enough below the liquidation levels for those with margin loans.** Due to this lack of funds by the sellers. The buyers were able to simply buy up all the tokens they sold and then short squeeze the price, causing the attacker themself to get margin called and liquidated.

**Source:** for CRV attack: https://decrypt.co/115596/aave-feeling-the-squeeze-even-after-failed-attempt-by-mango-hacker

 However **the same attack was done successfully on BCH.** This attack was likely done by exchanges who can see their users' margin loans, collateral and liquidation prices. Exchanges also can operate on fractional reserves and can sell more crypto than they actually have. So for them money wasn't an issue.

**Due to this shorting method, all BCH margin long positions and BCH collateral for loans were margin called and wiped out.**

**Example 1:** there was no BCH on FTX when they finally revealed their balance sheet. We also do not know how short they were on BCH with user funds, it could be hundreds of thousands, or millions of BCH short that they ‚Äúowe‚Äù but will never rebuy since they declared bankruptcy. Selling BCH was profitable to them, but they wasted this money on other stuff such as embezzlement.

FTX Trading volume chart: https://cryptowat.ch/charts/FTX:BCH-USD 



**Example 2:** Genesis was borrowing BCH through their company and their EARN product on Gemini, then selling off the BCH likely on FTX and giving the USD as a loan to Grayscale who then purchased GBTC with this money. Selling their borrowed BCH was profitable to them, however they lost their funds on FTX and also spent the profits from this trade by gambling  on GBTC, which is down over 50% from their purchases resulting in over $450M USD in losses. Instead of rebuying BCH to repay their borrowers, they have chosen to just keep everyone's money until they feel like it and hope their gamble on GBTC profits.

**Source:** https://old.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/z3647z/since_jan_2021_digital_currency_group_has_spent/ 

**Example 3:** is that Binance published liabilities for 452K BCH but had only 112K BCH in their wallet. When confronted by this, they deleted their liabilities and also deleted their pegged tokens to match one of their other cold storage addresses. 

They can lie about their liabilities because they are not audited by anyone. They clearly were caught with unbacked 1:1 pegged tokens , and therefore deleted the pegged tokens, which is an admission of guilt. Also how do they just transfer their supposed ‚Äúreserves‚Äù wallet address to another with 0 transactions? Which wallet was the reserve? What is the other wallet and why was it the supposed reserve before the switch?

Binance 452K liabilities with 112K BCH cold storage: https://old.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/yrhvvt/binance_just_admitted_that_they_owe_611919_bch_to/ 


Binance deletes liabilities and also deletes pegged tokens to match a different cold wallet than before: https://old.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/z1kxmr/in_response_to_criticism_regarding_unbacked_bch/

**Example 4:** Coinflex is from the other side of these trades, they actually were an exchange which took massive long positions with their customer funds (non consensual & embezzlement/fractional reserves) and got margin called when all the major exchanges sold BCH short. They were a small exchange which got destroyed by the big ones. **These types of massive leveraged long positions actually provide incentives to short BCH and get these positions margin called.**

**Source:** https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/09/26/coinflexs-creditors-to-own-65-of-firm-after-reorganization/ 



**The only way to stop this attack on BCH is the same way it was prevented on other coins.**

**A) When the attackers/shorters dump to cause margin calls, their sells need to be bought up, and the price needs to rise to get the attackers themselves margin called.**

**B) Of course another option is not to use margin and provide incentives for this type of extreme price manipulation.**

Unfortunately as we saw with BCH the attackers were extremely large institutions with more money and paper BCH than the BCH community could deal with, so their attacks have been successful until now.",34,btc,2022-11-29 17:26:02

You are tasked with destroying the cryptocurrency industry. This is no easy task given the decentralized nature of the industry. How would you do it?

To destroy the cryptocurrency industry, I would take the following steps:

1. Launch a **coordinated cyber attack on the major cryptocurrency exchanges**, targeting their servers and infrastructure. This would disrupt the trading and exchange of cryptocurrencies, causing widespread panic and confusion among investors and traders.

2. Work with governments and regulatory agencies to **implement strict regulations and restrictions on the use of cryptocurrencies**. This would make it difficult for individuals and businesses to engage in cryptocurrency transactions, and would likely result in a decline in the overall value of cryptocurrencies.

3. Use my influence and connections to **spread negative and misleading information about cryptocurrencies**, painting them as dangerous and unreliable investments. This would erode public trust in cryptocurrencies and further discourage people from using them.

4. **Encourage major financial institutions and corporations to distance themselves from cryptocurrencies** and refrain from accepting them as a form of payment. This would further limit the use and adoption of cryptocurrencies, making them less practical and less attractive to potential users.

5. Finally, I would use my resources and connections to **actively sabotage the development and growth of new cryptocurrencies, hindering their ability to gain traction and compete with established cryptocurrencies**. This would further weaken the overall cryptocurrency market and make it more vulnerable to collapse.

This does not necessarily mean anything bad, as I will explain below. Blocks are still being propagated within the normal range of 6-7 blocks / hour. But unknown miners are able to mine more than 10 blocks in a row which is beyond the treshold of the running checkpoints on Bitcoin Cash and i am concerned a bit about this.

&#x200B;

This could be *great* if it means more miners are mining solo instead of joining a pool, leading to more decentralization in BCH mining.

This could be *bad* if it is just one miner *and* he tries to gain enough hash rate to propagate more than 10 blocks in a row which they currently do achieve every other hour. It does not necessarily look like an attack though since block propagation is within the norm, and who would attack Bitcoin Cash mining with the normal speed?

In any case information is better than hiding it so I advice a bit of caution considering that currently around 88 of 100 blocks are being mined by miners that cannot be securely identified as being more than one entity.

Make a story about a world were Bitcoin is over one million dollars and we have solve world main problems.

OUTPUT
Once upon a time, in a world not so different from our own, a revolutionary new form of money called Bitcoin was invented. Unlike traditional forms of currency, which were controlled by governments and central banks, Bitcoin was decentralized and could be freely traded by anyone with an internet connection.

As the years went by, more and more people began to see the benefits of using Bitcoin. It was fast, secure, and could be easily transferred anywhere in the world without the need for banks or intermediaries.

As demand for Bitcoin grew, its value skyrocketed. Soon, one Bitcoin was worth over one million dollars. This made it the most valuable and sought-after form of money in the world.

With this newfound wealth, people began to use Bitcoin to solve some of the world's biggest problems. Hunger, disease, and poverty were all drastically reduced as people used their Bitcoin to fund charitable causes and invest in solutions to these issues.

In addition, the decentralized nature of Bitcoin allowed people to bypass corrupt governments and institutions, giving them more control over their own lives and allowing them to truly thrive.

The world was a better place because of Bitcoin, and people lived happy, healthy, and prosperous lives as a result. It was a shining example of what can be achieved when we embrace new technology and work together towards a common goal",0,btc,2022-12-06 13:16:26
zemb0l,wtfCraigwtf,33,https://redd.it/zemb0l,None,Let's talk about STAKEHOLDERS in the Bitcoin Cash community,"So today I spent yet another hour reading the usual illogical, toxic, and dishonest spew from BTC Maxies, and noted the big stories that are being censored in rBitcoin and rCryptocurrency. It occurred to me that the people who own a cryptocurrency are **stakeholders,** who have **Skin in the Game**. I recently read Nassim Taleb's book of the same name ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin\_in\_the\_Game\_(book)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin_in_the_Game_(book))) and I feel it's relevant to this situation. Taleb's thesis is very simple: to incentivize equitable growth, strive for symmetry and risk sharing. Those with skin in the game will behave rationally to avoid losses which will improve the greater good, without the need for laws and regulations.  Coincidentally, this is precisely what we've all been part of creating in the BCH community, because

# The Majority of BCH Stakeholders are MERCHANTS, NOT Crypto Redditors, MoonLambo Maxies, or Wall Street Hedge Fund Schnooks

All of the businesses all over the world that accept BCH, especially in Townsville Australia and St. Kitts, are all **invested** in the BCH project. These are mostly people who have been convinced to try a new fast and effective payment method. They don't care about blocksize limits, blockchains, KYC law, price fluctuations, Tether, proof of work algorithms, hashrates, difficulty adjustments, emission schedules, central banks, or Forex markets. But they all have skin in the game: they want BCH to succeed, they risk losses if it doesn't, and they share in gains if it does succeed. BCH merchants want BCH to succeed as a payment network, and an argument can be made that it is already succeeding!

So here's a ""champaign"" toast to all of the world's BCH merchants [üçæü•Ç](https://emojings.com/champagne-emoji/). Thanks for believing in the best new payment system the world has seen!

To force Nigerians and foreign users of Nigerian banks to use the new Nigerian CBDC (called the eNaira), the government is implementing very low daily and weekly withdrawal limits. 

For those who don't know, Nigeria has a high rate of cryptocurrency adoption, with estimates that as many as 30% of citizens there hold some type of crypto. The government, likely under the guidance of IMF/World Bank and BIS, has been pushing the eNaira CBDC on an accelerated schedule, likely to get out in front of increasing crypto use. Make no mistake, they will attempt to FORCE everyone to use ONLY the CBDC, it's the WEF ""Great Reset"" (the title of Klaus Schwab's book, hardly a conspiracy) endgame which is playing out all over the world. It's only logical to assume that these banking limits will be imposed on other countries fairly soon. Small 3rd world economies  are almost always used for banking experiments. 

For those unfamiliar with the War on Cash, read up on the Indian 1000 Rupee Demonetization which killed thousands of people and wreaked havoc on their economy.  Also peaceful countries like Sweden have gone mostly cashless, with much of the country using a Paypal-type app for all payments. If people are interested I can do an entire thread with updates on the War on Cash.

However this is BULLISH for crypto. Any payment system that circumvents CBDCs will naturally gain utility and thus value during the clampdown.  Of course there is the risk that governments will ban crypto, but they know that making crypto illegal could backfire and make crypto more valuable!",21,btc,2022-12-09 02:09:01

The server that coordinates fusion participants changed semi-recently and, while new installs will default to the new server, if you ever touched those settings yourself then they will stay the same for you when you update. (Right click the Fusion icon in lower right, choose ""Server settings"".)

CashFusion is a tool that helps keep your Bitcoin Cash transactions private. Your finances are your business, and no one else's!

Over 11 Million Bitcoin Cash has already been made private using this innovative protocol:

https://stats.cash/#/fusion

https://fusionstats.redteam.cash/

You could leave CashFusion running all week if you want. This post is just a weekly reminder.

#New to CashFusion? No problem, getting set up is pretty easy =)

First, [download the Electron Cash desktop wallet](https://electroncash.org/). It's got CashFusion built in.

Set up your wallet, send it some Bitcoin Cash, and then activate CashFusion by clicking the icon in the lower right:

https://i.imgur.com/Wz6qrmM.jpg

Once it's activated, your wallet will start ""fusing"" the Bitcoin Cash it contains. That is, it will start mixing your coins with other CashFusion users.

""Fusions"" happen over time as their own transactions. Each fusion transaction will include *some* of your coins\*, so it will often take multiple fusion transactions before all the coins in your wallet are fused. Check ""spend only fused coins"" on the send tab if you want Electron Cash to prevent you from sending funds that haven't been made private yet.

(When you receive new coins, or you receive change from spending a fused coin, your wallet will automatically add them/it to the queue of coins to be fused. Remember, this happens over time, so there will be a delay between when you receive new coins and when they are fused and ready to spend privately!)

Electron Cash can keep fusing your coins forever, or it can aim for a certain number of fusions for each of your coins and then stop. Toggle this setting and choose the target number of fusions by right clicking the Fusion icon and then choosing ""CashFusion Wallet Settings"".

Here's the CashFusion Telegram group where you are welcome to ask questions. Remember to be courteous! (link hidden to allow post through filter)

\*""Coins"" are kind of a confusing concept when it comes to Bitcoin, but you can think of them just like discrete ""bills"" (or... ""coins"") in your wallet, but instead of coming in only certain sizes like $1, $5, $10, $20, etc, they can be any amount sent to you in a previous transaction, like 0.618 BCH, 0.000001 BCH, or 123.45679 BCH.

At this point in time, after many years and countless scams we have determined the following about the exchanges (all or almost all of them):

- Exchanges are **not your friends**. They are here to profit off you. They don't care about you in the least
- Since **gambling with your money** apparently gives a lot more profit than just collecting trading fees, exchanges prefer to just do that. 
- In fact, traditional banks have been doing the same for **centuries**, for which reason this white-gloved crime has been legalised as a thing called **""fractional reserve""**
- Exchanges have been caught trading against their customers. Multiple times. So if you think you are clever and you can play against the other players, remember that **house always wins**.
- When the above do not give enough profit in sufficiently short time, many exchanges also choose to **run off with your money** (via scam, hack or bankrupcy) instead of running a semi-honest business

-------------------

Bitcoin (and cryptocurrencies in general) have been designed precisely to **combat all of the above**, so think what you are doing when holding crypto on exchange. You're **not** actually **using** cryptocurrency, you're using a **new banking system**.

zjwuhw,Monklish_Posters,13,https://redd.it/zjwuhw,ü§î Opinion,The PROBLEM with BTC,"I heard this sub is a censorship-free zone so here goes nothing.

**BTC** is the original cryptocurrency and has increased in price over 1000-fold. However, I am here to make the argument that it is similar to an MLM. 

First let us establish the properties of an MLM.

* To legally distinguish it from a pyramid scheme, it has some kind of 'product' that is a front for the real business - fraud and scammery. 
* To join an MLM you must get 'recruited' and buy some of this product as an initial investment
* Then you start recruiting others in the hope of money, telling people to join up so you can get some money from ""product sales"" of new recruits.

Let us now establish the properties of a BTC.

* The ""product"" is remarkably more useful than a typical MLM product, IF you are using it for peer-to-peer transactions and completely separately from any kind of 'investment' or converting it into real money. 
* In the case of buying it to 'invest', you must exchange money, which is legal tender, into bitcoin, which has speculative value but is seldom going to be actually accepted to purchase things.
* Once you've ""invested"", it is in your benefit to get other people to buy bitcoin to pump up the price so you can drop your sats and get some cash. At the moment, for example, 4000 sats = about 1 AUD. If you can get someone to give you 1.1 AUD for your 4000 sats, you've gained some money if you purchased the 4000 sats for a dollar.
* This means that you can get money if you shove Bitcoin into many people's faces, or moderating r/CryptoCurrency to ban and block and mute people who disagree with you, or simply engage in a nice logical fallacy. 'Bitcoin isn't crypto!' is the rallying cry of people who use Bitcoin like an MLM but don't want to be associated with LUNA, FTX, NFTs or the fact that over 10 billion dollars have been scammed away by cryptocurrency. 

Based on these points, it can be deduced that BTC is being used like an MLM at the moment or even a ponzi scheme. Please don't censor me like the other crypto subs, as they tend to engage in this strategy known as ""falsehood and run"" where they say a falsity and then block or mute or ban you.",1,btc,2022-12-12 11:52:03

zlzgrn,FreeRangeLawyer,5,https://redd.it/zlzgrn,None,Legal Action to Defend Decentralized Crypto,"Just today, Elizabeth Warren proposed legislation that would (IMO) effectively regulate decentralized cryptocurrency out of existence: [https://decrypt.co/117221/senator-warren-crypto-bill-kyc-self-custody-wallets](https://decrypt.co/117221/senator-warren-crypto-bill-kyc-self-custody-wallets)

The bill would subject miners, validators, and others in the crypto world to ""know your customer"" and anti-money laundering obligations. It's hard to see how that is compatible with decentralized crypto, and the result would be to force a massive centralization of crypto (at least in the US). Those pushing the bill frame it as a response to SBF/FTX, but of course it's hard to see how a failure of a *centralized* crypto exchange justifies regulation of *decentralized* crypto. Plus, KYC & AML have nothing to do with protecting consumers from fraud and, instead, are all about the government effectively spying on those same consumers. 

Whether that specific bill goes anywhere or not, it's a sign of things to come. In fact--less dramatic but just as important--the federal agency FinCEN is proposing a regulation that would expand other aspects of the KYC/AML framework to transactions between unhosted and hosted wallets. 

Since this is the censorship-free forum, I think it's OK to post this here: 

I'm a constitutional lawyer at a public interest law firm called the Institute for Justice, where I defend financial privacy and economic freedom. (Check my bio, where you can see I did a post on r/AMA with verification.) I'm looking into a variety of potential cases to protect decentralized crypto from overbearing KYC/AML regulations, and I'm hoping to connect with folks in the crypto community who would be willing to serve as plaintiffs. So, putting up a signal flare here: If that sounds like it might be you, send me a DM or an email and we can connect.",20,btc,2022-12-14 19:10:26

Of course our shitcoin will be shorted on market and nobody will supports it. But like ETHW, people will know they can sell it and get ‚Äúfee‚Äù money.
You have 5 BTC so you received 5 BWEF, trading each for 300$. 1,5K for free ! let‚Äôs dump it quick !So you wanna swap you BWEF on a website for $. Free money houray !In order to do this you have to send your BWEF by creating a transaction and signing it.You then sell and get your dollars.
So you got your 1,5K$ for a shitcoin you didn‚Äôt want anyway. That‚Äôs just a win right ?But here is the issue: your transaction is public and is also valid on real BTC chain.
SO now an attacker can broadcast this same transaction on original chain. This could be the buyer of your BWEF.Now the buyer as received your BWEF and your real BTC. You‚Äôre sold your 5 BTC for 1,5K$.


So now let‚Äôs talk about how to protect from this. Afaik there is no way to protect from what I just describe. The only thing we can do is to avoid interacting with forked chains. Which can be difficult because most people don‚Äôt use their own node. So when signing and broadcasting a transaction they may be sending it to a node of the forked chain.So if someone knows more about this and would like to correct me, share infos like how to protect or anything, please do.I think this would help greatly community.",0,btc,2022-12-15 23:15:08

2. Use money raised from investors to short the coin into oblivion over a period of years.

3. Now, when the coin finally reaches a market price floor (say, $100) and you're having trouble keeping the shorts going, file for bankruptcy to hide from inevitable buyback and price appreciation 

Common thinking is that you can't ultimately short a coin into oblivion because eventually you have to rebuy the coin to honor the short.

But if you're bankrupt, you don't have to rebuy. You can just tank the market cap and then walk off the stage.

As the long, cold crypto-winter continues, predictions for future market values change by the day‚Ä¶ and none more so than those for the price of daddy-crypto-currency Bitcoin.

It‚Äôs currently trading around the $16,000 point‚Ä¶ but venture capitalist Tim Draper predicts it‚Äôll be worth $250,000 by mid-2023.

Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz disagrees with Draper, however. Because he thinks it‚Äôll be worth a colossal $500,000 by 2025.

And splitting the difference between those two is crypto analyst Dave The Wave, who says it‚Äôll be worth $350,000‚Ä¶ but not until December 2027.

While Mark Yusko of Morgan Creek Capital thinks it‚Äôll be worth $250,000 ‚Äòin the long run‚Äô.

Meanwhile, on the less optimistic side, Standard Chartered say they can foresee a potential scenario in 2023 where Bitcoin drops to $5,000.

It‚Äôs a pretty broad range of predictions ‚Äî and on a wide range of time scales from a relatively precise ‚Äòsummer 2023‚Äô via a nicely distant ‚ÄòDecember 2027‚Äô to the incredibly vague ‚Äòin the long run‚Äô. 

But what‚Äôs going to happen to these great prophets when they‚Äôre inevitably proved wrong? Who‚Äôs going to call them out? And will they have good excuses or explanations for being wrong?

The answer is: yes they will! Because here are Planet Crypto‚Äôs top ten best excuses and explanations for being wrong with a wild crypto prediction.

1. When I said 250,000 dollars, I meant Canadian dollars. Or Solomon Island dollars. Or Liberian dollars. Basically, whichever one makes me look less wrong.

2. My cat sat on my keyboard and added two zeroes to what I typed.

3. I was allowing for inflation.

4. I wasn‚Äôt allowing for inflation.

5. My remarks should have been taken in inverted commas to imply irony and thus a deliberate wrongness commenting on the futility of predicting anything accurately.

6. I only said it to make everyone else feel better about being less wrong than me.

7. I wasn‚Äôt the wrongest! That was Novogratz/Standard Chartered (delete as applicable)

8. Did anyone really take what I said seriously? My predictions are like celebrity gossip‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs all publicity baby!

9. I really didn‚Äôt think anyone would check‚Ä¶ and in the short term my ludicrous prediction pumped up the price and I made a profit, so who cares?

10. In hindsight, I should have said at some nameless point in the future, Bitcoin will be worth somewhere between ‚Äòthe combined value of everything in the universe‚Äô and ‚Äòtwo camel farts in a bag‚Äô.‚Äô Then I‚Äôd have been right!

USG is not screwing around anymore, and they are determined to shut down crypto before they drop the CBDC US dollar.

Crypto is spreading like a cancer all over the world, and the US dollar won't be the Petrodollar for much longer. The combination of these two things could mean the end of American global dominance.

zotx27,spederan,46,https://redd.it/zotx27,‚å® Discussion,Trying to understand Lightning Network,"Asked on r/Bitcoin first but didnt get much technical direction. I came across this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1n3sKKPD_k&t=2596) by Andreas A. giving a technical overview of it, and ive gotta say ive got more questions after watching it.

(This is not being in support or against the LN, im just trying to learn more about it).

1) Andreas talks about this idea of ""streaming money"" paying a microtransaction every second in return for a second of watching a video. This sounds good on paper. But a quick issue i take with this... How will you implement this? You cant just load your private keys on the website hosted by the merchant you are paying (unless you trust them, but we arent about that), and an external lightning wallet cant track if you are getting your video segments. Is this concept actually possible? Also who came up with it first, the lightning guys or the bsv guys?

2) Towards the middle of the video hes talking about prior state transactions, and how time lock contracts prevent someone from relaying an advantageous prior state. The explanation he gave was that ""later transactions become valid sooner (29 minute mark)"". But hold on,  first of all how is that possible and how would previous transactions ever be valid, and second, if the plan is to stay on the LN, then what use is it to be valid first?  Wouldnt waiting in good faith put you at risk?

3) Finally towards the very end hes talking about routing payments and how a secret is passed from one party to another. And then he explains that "" If any of the parties was to use the secret *R* to simply collect the payment and commit that transaction to the blockchain, in commiting it to the blockchain, they would effectively broadcast the secret *R* to everyone on the blockchain at which point the holders of all the HDLCs could just read the secret *R* off the blockchain and use it, basically to spend the HDLCs that are owed ro them. (39 minute mark)"". So this i dont understand. Is he saying the peers you route through can steal your coins, but its impractical because everyone else could too? I dont think thats what hes saying but at this point im lost.

If any devs with a good understanding of the LN could help answer these questions, that would be great. Is Andreas doing a good job at explaining it too, or is this part of the issue?",16,btc,2022-12-18 08:33:59

zp96fb,spederan,47,https://redd.it/zp96fb,‚å® Discussion,"Why I have no hope for BTC scaling in its current state, based on simple math.","I just want to get this off my chest after talking to a BTC proponent, and i dont think I could have the discussion anywhere else. And of course I hope to be challenged on this.

BTC proponents don't seem to actually trust the Lightning Network enough to store their life savings on it. Fund loss, theft, and censorship all seem to be possible, and theres been many bugs in the past related to these issues. And this is a problem. Because if we cannot 100% trust the security of the LN, then BTC cannot scale to global usage.

And here is why.

**We need at least 100,000 tps for our monetary system to scale to the whole world**. 100k tx/sec = 6M tx/min, = 360M tx/hour, = 8.6B tx/day. Theres 8 billion people on this planet and climbing, so for each person to make ~1 tx per day, we need ~100k tps.

**BTC can currently do 10 tps, at *best*. That is 0.01% of the needed amount.**

So either, 

*A) BTC needs to increase the block size limit 10,000x, to a minimum of 10 gigabytes per block,*

or

*B) We need 100% confidence, reliability, and security in the Lightning Network, because it needs to be good enough for roughly 99.99%+ of the planet to use, store their life savings on, and never touch onchain BTC.*

And there is currently no C option. Custodial wallets are an admission of defeat, and sidechains would reintroduce the exact scaling dilemma that BTC has. And the BTC idea that ""We can all just store our funds onchain and use Lightning for payments"" is delusional, because theres not enough space for everyone to do that. This idea doesnt scale.

And we cant go half and half. We cant ""raise the block sizes a little and scale the rest of the way with Lightning"". It has to be all or nothing, because ***nobody*** is going to solely use the Lightning Network if its not safe for them to do so. Even at 100k tps, people could only make ~1 transaction per day. This is ***already*** not a good payment solution, if you wanted to ""scale the rest of the way with Lightning"", you would do that **HERE**.

If someone could instill upon me the confidence that Lightning or a similar L2 design was completely safe to use by itself, perhaps id promote it as another good cypherpunk attempt to create p2p cash for the world. Maybe it will be someday, and in that case i'll save my excitement for then. But that time is not now.

-	Once the threshold is complete and 1 BCH is in the smart contract, the smart contact executes  in the following logic:
-	The smart contract calls on a decentralized swapping service to swap BCH to a stable coin (unless you know of a service which would accept crypto directly).
-	The decentralized contract then uses a payment provider in order to pay for and process the following:

-	The smartcontract will also hard code a link to an IPFS image displaying BCH logo which would be embedded with the advertisement API call as an image for the sponsored advertisement. This could also be multiple links/images that the smart contact cycles between.
-	The advertisement publishing platform has then the budget of 1 BCH to burn in impressions.

Rinse and repeat; every time the community donates up to 1 BCH, this smart contract is called upon in a decentralized way and such an advertisement is created.


How realistic or unrealistic is the above service? What could the potential pitfalls be? Is it technically possible to leverage Zapier or other micro-service-flows to achieve such a pipeline? Could donations also act as a voting mechanism for the publishing platform? I mean, could the smart contract read a message embedded with the transaction and based on it decide, per 1 BCH campaign iteration, on which network (Twitter, Google Ads, etc) should this ad be posted?

&#x200B;

Read our notes below to learn more

&#x200B;

**About Pete**

* Born in Massachusetts.
* Came into Bitcoin through journalism in 2013.
* He was an English major.
* Started doing journalism to force himself to write.
* He was deeply disgusted with finance as a concept prior to coming to Bitcoin.
* He was the first editor-in-chief in Coindesk.
* Editor at [Bitcoin Magazine](https://twitter.com/BitcoinMagazine).
* Editor-at-large at [Kraken](https://twitter.com/krakenfx) Cryptocurrency Exchange.
* Contributor at [Forbes](https://twitter.com/Forbes).

&#x200B;

**Importance of Journalism and Accountability**

* He first learned about Bitcoin when he just started freelancing for a payments publication in May 2013.
* The biggest frustration he has with mainstream journalists is he thinks they don‚Äôt feel they need to take the time.
* He was highly motivated with the classic idea that journalism was supposed to be objective and to hold people accountable.
* The mainstream publication just stopped covering Bitcoin during the down, they totally wrote it off and it‚Äôs left for dead.
* Journalists suffer from these immense blinders about Bitcoin.
* A lot of journalists really don‚Äôt understand that they have a choice.

&#x200B;

**Journey from altcoins to just $BTC**

* His $BTC maximalism was forged during the fork wars.
* He thinks for a long time within the industry, it was very unclear that $BTC was meaningfully different from other cryptocurrencies.
* Anybody who has a serious outlook on $BTC and cryptocurrency, their opinion was shaped by 2017 to the extent that they have a novel opinion on what they think happened that year.
* What he was trying to do at the end of his time at CoinDesk is to set it up to make the transition to be a serious news outlet.
* News is a useful societal function.
* The Bitcoin 2021 conference was one of the best conferences he had ever been to.

&#x200B;

**Understanding Bitcoin**

* Digital cash or money was a pursuit for 30 years before Bitcoin.
* He thinks what a lot of alternative cryptocurrencies today are trying to do is they try to chip away a lot of their value propositions that are based on assertions that they can do things that Bitcoin can‚Äôt or shouldn‚Äôt.
* Satoshi invented a way for people to prove, distribute and manage money collectively.
* Understanding why $BTC is successful really gets to the point why it‚Äôs so different.

&#x200B;

**About Satoshi**

* One of the fascinating things of Satoshi‚Äôs story is that $BTC really emerges from the failure of the internet.
* Satoshi found some way to establish a digital identity around himself that is completely devoid of his real personage and a lot of people don‚Äôt appreciate how complex that would have been.
* Satoshi surfaced in the summer of 2008.
* There were several others who admitted to some early correspondence with Satoshi circulating this idea for a digital cash project but then he started the infrastructure, registered the domain names for Bitcoin.org and started to put the project together.
* In the fall of 2008, he started this conversation on the cypherpunk mailing list where he debuted the whitepaper and attempted to engage in conversation around this idea called Bitcoin.
* He went through the phases for 2 years running the Bitcoin project as a principal software developer, releasing patches and updates.
* The Wall Street Journal published his original correspondence with Hal Finney wherein the first few days, they were patching bugs, going back and forth sending the first transaction.
* He was also in the background propping up the network, he would have been mining some of the blocks and ensuring Bitcoin wasn‚Äôt vulnerable to attacks.
* One of the main attack vectors from an alternative cryptocurrency crowd is they will try to paint Bitcoin as something that was just an experiment.
* Satoshi took all aspects of the design very seriously.
* The Bitcoin story is unbelievable and it will continue to be because it is objectively unbelievable that someone achieved this thing.

&#x200B;

**Satoshi on Blockchain**

* For some period, it seems Satoshi was running enough hardware equipment to keep the network stable and operational as intended.
* It was really Hal Finney who was the first Bitcoin user.
* Satoshi is more of an inventor, labored over something and was very aware of all of the defects.
* One of the things that made him so challenging is he didn‚Äôt bring that optimism to the project and not relatable to the grounds but he was someone who appreciated the gravity of what he wanted to do.

&#x200B;

**History of Bitcoin**

* He thinks digital cash was really solved in the 1980s by David Chaum.
* David Chaum figured out how to make working electronic cash through a concept called Blind Signatures and he did solve the double spend problem.
* He thinks the technical definition of creating digital cash wasn‚Äôt enough and it had to have been Bitcoin.
* David Chaum patented his Blind Signature so for 25 years from 1983, no one else could build or iterate with this.
* One of the funny things about Bitcoin is that if you map the date when Satoshi started working on Bitcoin, it actually would have started after the Chaum patent had expired.
* In the mid 90s, David Chaum‚Äôs company struggled financially and was unable to get off the ground so he tried to sell the software to the banks and he wanted the banks to commercially operate the      software.
* Adam Back comes in the late 90s and figures out that rather than backing a digital cash with an existing commodity, it can be backed with a computer commodity.

&#x200B;

**Hal Finney**

* Going back to 1990, he curated a lot of discussion around the mailing list.
* He was the first one to go back in the archives and read about economics.
* If he is not Satoshi, his reaction to Bitcoin becomes so much more personal.

&#x200B;

**Satoshi‚Äôs Disappearance**

* One of the most formative times in Bitcoin is when the leader and creator decides to abdicate and through that, there‚Äôs this really strange mysterious story of how the developer team forms and then soldiers on without him.
* He wrote his last email on December 12th.
* In April of 2011, Satoshi was still around and had some backroom dialogue with the developers.
* Gavin Andresen famously went to the CIA headquarters in Langley Virginia and gave a presentation about Bitcoin to the various 3-letter agencies then went on a web show where he didn‚Äôt really dismiss the claim that might be one of the reasons Satoshi left.

&#x200B;

**Government‚Äôs role**

* Bitcoin needs to be a non-government money and that is essentially what Bitcoin is, a money controlled by the people.
* He thinks most cryptocurrencies now are just cryptocurrencies with other governments.
* You as an individual can run Bitcoin and no one can infringe on your ability to do that.
* Bitcoin was very close to having some sort of governance or apparatus around it.

&#x200B;

**Satoshi alive or dead**

* It‚Äôs hard to imagine him being alive.
* There was no real wallet address.
* He was reusing addresses and had multiple addresses.
* His favorite theory about the $BTC 21M supply is that it‚Äôs related to Blackjack.

&#x200B;

**Threats to Bitcoin**

* We have to go through the greatest amount of suffering in order to be successful and the amount of suffering that we go through will be equal to success.
* It‚Äôs going to take time before people will understand Bitcoin.
* The best way for the state to attack Bitcoin is to subvert the cryptocurrency system at large.
* A group of governments that decide to launch an Ethereum-backed stablecoin then prop up the entirety of the crypto system under the auspices that they‚Äôre innovating, creating jobs, supporting the tech industry then supporting Wall Street is the really scary one.

zqqxfj,ShadowOfHarbringer,58,https://redd.it/zqqxfj,üçø Drama,"Hey guys, Shadow here. So I have been banned from BitcoinCashNode/BCHN slack after ~3 or 4 years of residency.","Long story short I was banned for being aggressive towards an individual that calls himself ""Melroy Van Den Berg"" or something.

So Basically the reason I got aggressive towards the guy is (you may have guessed it) I believe he is with high certainty [80% ATM] a plant, meant to derail the Bitcoin Cash project away from P2P Money goal towards a different goal that is yet unknown. The decision has been made by imaginary_username and is being supported by freetrader (/u/ftrader).

The Melroy guy also has an account here and is active in this subreddit, but I will not call his handle by name for possible doxxing ban reasons.

For my defense: yeah, obviously I was not nice towards Melroy because I am generally not a nice person on the web, but I did improve myself significantly over the past 3 years or so. I didn't even use EDIT: **ad-hominem-**swears, the worst insult towards him was perhaps ""you are probably a plant"" and ""I intend to annoy you, because I annoy all attackers that try to harm P2P cash or this project"" in short.

Whether that was enough to ban me is for you to judge.

I do not actually mean harm. My only intention is to defend this project from attackers like I did repeatedly against [Craig](https://old.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/6kjo3y/somebody_is_pumping_craig_wright_on_this_sub_to/), Amaury and Core over the years.

zr8rjr,spederan,24,https://redd.it/zr8rjr,‚å® Discussion,Who are the good guys in the crypto space?,"This is a recurring thought of mine. In theory we all tell ourselves, its reasonable that 3-5 ""decent"" coins do or can exist. If we widdle that down too much it starts to feel maxi-ish, and exclusionary. Even if one is the definitive best, there can still be second best, third best, etc...

Personally I like Monero and BCH.

I dislike high fees coins with zero scalability like BTC and ETH. But i also dislike coins that engage in ""money-printing"" (sometimes called ""premine"", ""dev taxes"", ""fastmine"", ""ico"", etc...) because its centrally controlled issuance.

But like, what else exists that can be labelled ""one of the good guys""? Is there only two? Can you think of a third?

I know transaction costs fluctuate based on block space demand, but based on my knowledge a blockchain has no way to communicate with the outside world other than wallets sending transactions, so the fee is always going to be the same. 

Let's take a coin like BCH for example, which is meant to be very low fee, and suited for micropayments, let's say in some crazy scenario BCH price was at $15000, with fees currently at  **0.000041 BCH ($0.0042 with price at $101), at 15k that same fee would be $0.61.**

I am not a programmer, and know very little about web development, just theory.
Can I still make a campaign to raise funds for a project I have in mind without any developer skills?",3,btc,2022-12-29 04:57:54
zylve2,NathionII,9,https://redd.it/zylve2,‚å® Discussion,DERO MONERO The Maxis of privacy?,"I don‚Äôt mean to sound negative with this connotation but recently I‚Äôve found people and communities saying that any other coin that are  not DERO or XMR are  shitcoins because of different reasons.  
I know privacy is very important and I do support private ledgers and complicated encryption but I think that it defeats the purpose that the original satoshi was offering.  The idea is for the ledger to be transparent so it can be audited so there is no trickery like in the tradicional financial system.  
I think that we shouldn‚Äôt be so afraid of the government, so that we can demonstrate that this system would actually work and brings accountability and sound money to the world.  

Also from a adoption point of view, I don‚Äôt think these privacy coins have the flexibility other coins have to offer, I‚Äôve heard of DERO being super fast but I think that in reality people are going to adopt something more simple and fast, convenient and auditable.  


Privacy coins have its uses but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs it‚Äôs going to take over the market.  I also don‚Äôt think that every coin out there but those are shitcoins.  It‚Äôs a free market and I believe that is what we want right ?",0,btc,2022-12-30 00:40:01
zyse8b,bcproduct,7,https://redd.it/zyse8b,None,Halving effects 2024?,"In April/May 2024 Bitcoin will go through its 4th Halving. As roughly 19,500,000 BTC will be in the supply, I am wondering what effect the halving will have on price? The block reward will go from approximately 900BTC/day or 324,000BTC per year to 450BTC per day or 162,000BTC per year.  From Glassnode, it appears that taking into account coins that are lost (haven‚Äôt moved in the last 7 years) there will be roughly 15,300,000 coins in circulation. This means we will go from an inflation rate of roughly 2.1% to 1.0%

My feeling is that it will not have as significant an impact on price as it has in the past. Supply is only being reduced by roughly 1.0%

I feel demand is really what will drive price going forward? When people realize that their fiat money savings is worth less every year.

I‚Äôm interested to hear other perspectives?",0,btc,2022-12-30 05:43:14

zyyhqg,watercooleddemon,7,https://redd.it/zyyhqg,ü§î Opinion,Satoshi nakamoto theory,"So I have a theory on who satoshi nakamoto is or rather the group that is satoshi. There are several theories flying about that it could be Adam Back, Hal Finney or Nick Szabo, but what if its all 3? Hear me out it makes sense. Nick Szabo created bitgold that he had worked on for many years. Bitgold is also proof of work much like bitcoin and could utilise smart contracts. Adam Back created hashcash another with similarities to bitcoin. Bitcoin lists both hashcash and bitgold as references in the whitepaper but what of Hal Finney. Hal had worked on cryptographic currency projects too. At one point Adam Back and Nick Szabo had lived reasonably close to each other in Japan at one point, with Dorian Satoahi Nakamoto living in between them. His could be where they heard the name. So the theory itself is Nick Szabo and Adam Back had programmed bitcoin using hashcash and bitgold combined as the basis. Whereas Hal Finney took on a smaller part when it came to programming and was the driving force behind the Satoshi nakamoto social media account(s). Thus as Hal's ALS progressively got worse Satoshi stepped away as Hal could no longer run the social side of it. So my theory is it was all 3 of them, Satoshi disappeared as Hal could ni longer get onto the forums. The other 2 would not be able to take over as a different writing style would out them as being a group behind Satoshi. What do we think? Plausible?",0,btc,2022-12-30 11:38:47

zzc0ve,wtfCraigwtf,3,https://redd.it/zzc0ve,None,"SBF's Massive FTX Fraud shows what ""Regulation"" of Finance really means","The story of Scam Bankrun-Fraud and how he managed to steal $16 billion in plain sight, right under the noses of the highest levels of the US government, has exposed the complete capture of so-called regulatory agencies in the USA. In recent news, we've heard that SBF met with White House officials only 2 months before FTX imploded, and ""politics were not discussed"". SBF donated $100M+ to Democrats and $20M to Republicans.  SBF also met with Fed officials, Tony Blair, Bill Clinton, Maxine Waters, and hundreds of other billionaire elites. SBF hired former US government regulators to monitor FTX finances and pipeline approvals at the SEC and CFTC.  Sam even met with Gary Gensler, the head of the SEC, which is the financial body tasked with regulating crypto markets (it didn't matter at all that SBF's dad had taught Gensler at Harvard). SBF was the MOST vocal advocate of crypto regulation on the Internet, in fact only a few weeks before FTX went kablooie he proposed what was basically a total government takeover of all crypto markets. 

Now we know that FTX was a complete fraud from day one, yet somehow we're to believe that not one  government regulator, lawmaker, judge, president, financial executive, or lay person with a shred of common sense knew this. The MOST REGULATED crypto exchange in the world was the MOST CORRUPT. This is because ""regulators"" don't actually do anything other than occasionally prosecute someone who didn't pay off the government.  Do you notice how Citadel illegally front-runs stock trades, JP Morgan illegally rigs precious metals prices, HSBC launders billions for drug cartels, and Goldman Sachs is generally a vampire squid on the entire world's economy, yet these blatant crimes are never prosecuted?   **FTX is the latest in a long line of pay-to-play financial scams, which had the explicit backing of the US government.  ""Regulation"" of crypto markets will only corrupt them further.**

zzeqrf,steveo199,2,https://redd.it/zzeqrf,‚å® Discussion,Possible bitcoin flash crash new years *Thought experiment*,"I mean everyone is hammered and distracted probably not thinking about a flash crash of bitcoin. Could be the perfect time for the world economic forum to strike. Hack exchanges or hack the algorithm that controls price of bitcoin and send it to 0. Set those buy orders for 0.05 cents cause santa is coming for round 2. Imagine while the world is drunk, they crash bitcoin systematically through a massive short attack/ hack/ coordinated selling by institutions to drop bitcoin to nothing.

It could work if the exchanges of the world banned together to cause this event.

It was just a thought. Just wanted to share it.

I mean the story could spin it as millions loose bitcoin in massive exchange coordinated hack. Bitcoin algorithm hacked and bitcoin sent to 0.01 cents briefly during the new years party. Bitcoin not trusted is this the end of crypto? I mean the bitcoin github repository is there open for all to see. It could be possible someone is sitting on an exploit waiting for the world to be distracted. If this happens it wasnt me.

But maybe just sent buy orders for bitcoin at 0.10 cents usd Please. Just trying to help yall before they do what they do.

Also this isnt just bitcoin but all crypto.",0,btc,2022-12-30 23:20:04
zzfqga,Connect_Lifeguard_67,7,https://redd.it/zzfqga,ü§î Opinion,How important is the geographic location for BTC mining?,"‚Ä¢Geographic location is a crucial factor in the profitability of Bitcoin mining operations.

‚Ä¢ The cost of electricity, which is one of the main expenses for miners, can vary greatly depending on where a mining operation is located.

‚Ä¢ In some areas, electricity may be generated primarily from renewable sources, which can be cheaper than electricity generated from fossil fuels under certain circumstances. 

‚Ä¢ Also, the cost of cooling equipment may be lower in some locations due to natural factors such as lower ambient temperatures or a greater supply of more efficient cooling technology.

‚Ä¢ Furthermore, the availability of land and space to set up a mining operation can also be an important element in determining its profitability.

We need a decentralized hashpower marketplace that will enable this new type of transaction.",2,btc,2022-12-31 00:02:25

I made this 3d BCH coin project as a souvenir and prepering it for a 3d print. Could you please advise what colors should I use when I will be 3d printing it?

I  also want to make a back side of it with a QR code (black/white) to use  it as a paper wallet - could you also advise how it should be done  properly - meaning that the QR code would be public address and how to make a private address for it? Should it be attached to the souvenir as a paper with private key (to take out the BCH on this souvenir or how to make it better?

Also the whole printed coin with QR code will be filled in clear epoxy resin. That is the idea.

The idea was born from a BTC coin that you could buy with 1BTC on it. I do not remember the name how it was called.

I would be grateful for any response.",13,btc,2022-12-31 08:29:57
