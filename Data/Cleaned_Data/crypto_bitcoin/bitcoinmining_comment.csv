Crypto-Commie,"Start a DBA!  You actually don't need an accountant, almost everybody does their own DBA these days.  Filing the appropriate business licenses is a key step (you missed 2021 by one day though).  Also, meticulously track your crypto transactions, electricity and hardware costs.  All your costs are deductible and the remaining profits are taxable.    Deducting the electricity as a cost also helps with the profitability of the miner itself as it effectively lowers your electricity cost.

If you can afford an accountant to setup your DBA, it will definitely help - but you're looking at a pretty hefty fee to hire an accountant.",hqt2ayf,rthapn,/r/BitcoinMining/comments/rthapn/mining_in_the_usa_for_foreigners/hqt2ayf/,4,BitcoinMining,2022-01-01 14:17:39

Openminer,"I would imagine setting up a LLC.  Note there are a few types.  The most important one for you is to make this a business enterprise and not a personal one.  Business pay taxes differently than individuals.  It will also shield you from personal responsibility if done correctly.  Here's an example.  You mine crypto.  The govt says you have to take profits on the income.  You'd pay personal taxes.  Income tax, federal, state etc.  
You set an LLC.  Now you earn crypto.  You only pay a flat amount of tax, you don't pay income tax unless you pay yourself which is a big difference.  There are tax write offs you can use being an LLC that you can't as an individual.  If an outside company is involved in all of this than you can also set that up.  If might not have to pay any personal tax which is the highest taxes in this country.  It could be setup where your stay is paid for by the company, food is covered, vehicle etc and have a corporate card footing all expenses.  If your going big and not as a family man then you'd definitely want to get setup thru an accountant.  My friend who's in a different business is setup as an LLC an basically pays no tax until he passes 90 thousand.  
It also keeps liability off of you to where your not personally held responsible in the event of so weird damages as long as your not grossly negligent personally.  Example. The Asics burn up short out and fry the building burns and instead of anyone suing you they can only go after your company.  So if you had personal money tied up in a house no one can try to take it they'd only can go after business assets.  Example 2 your drunk driving a business vehicle.  Accident happens.  In that case they can go after the business but can also argue that your personally responsible and they can go after you as well.
Hope this helps.  You sound like this is not a small operation so definitely hire a competent accountant.  It will save you a ton of money doing so",hqx40gw,rthapn,/r/BitcoinMining/comments/rthapn/mining_in_the_usa_for_foreigners/hqx40gw/,2,BitcoinMining,2022-01-02 10:01:26

nsaquatics,"It's been a while since I messed with 3-Phase but here are my thoughts, somebody please correct me if I'm wrong.  
I think you may have a few things confused.

\- A 3 Phase connection, actually should produce \~400 Volts. This is typically only used by large motors or transformers and consists of three lines (L1, L2 &amp; L3), each being 1 phase. 400V \* 30 Amp = 20,000 Watts  
\- 2 Phase connections, in this case, consists of using two lines or phases (L1 &amp; L2) for example, should actually result in \~230 Volts. 230 V \* 30 Amp = 6,900 Watts

Any 1 Phase (L1, L2, or L3) against Neutral will produce \~120V  
Any 1 Phase against another Phase (i.e L1 against L3) will produce \~240V  


Any 1 Phase (L1, L2 or L3) against Neutral will produce \~120V  
Any 1 Phase against another Phase (i.e L1 against L3) will produce \~240V  


The point here is, that even though you have a 3 Phase connection, you're only using 2 of those 3 phases, so you need to calculate the actual load, based on the Phases you are actually using, and depending on what combinations of Phases you use, you can get more or less out of them.

You could for example have 4 S19J's connected to the 3 Phase connection with this combination:  
S19J 1 --&gt; **L1** &amp; L2  
S19J 2 --&gt; L2 &amp; L3  
S19J 3 --&gt; L3 &amp; **L1**

In this case, L1 is used twice, so the load is higher on it.

The S19j uses about 3068W at 230V, so that's a total of 12.78 Amps, so let's say 13 Amps.

So L1 in our example above would have a theoretical load of 26 Amps. This of course is an oversimplification, due to the nature of 3/2-Phase. It would be less, but you get the idea. I don't have the formula in my head at the moment, hopefully, somebody else can provide that.

What I'm trying to say though, is that, if you are hooking the miners up to 3 Phase, it depends on which of the three phases you are hooking each of them up to (Both on the Same Phases or not). to determine your calculation as to what loads are on each Phase.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, I'm not sure if we need to follow the 80% rule when it comes to Mains/outlet hookups, since I think that is already factored in. Would be nice if a professional electrician could share their wisdom in this regard.",hr3ffhl,rv5k0e,/r/BitcoinMining/comments/rv5k0e/acceptable_watts_on_30a_208v_3phase/hr3ffhl/,2,BitcoinMining,2022-01-03 17:20:51

It could be a hundred a day, but a year from then it might only be 20.00. watching videos for free might save you some money.

WhiteDogNC,"Your observations are accurate.  And your conclusion that mining is not for everyone is also accurate. 

You describe “a pile of S9s” that are a nuisance, and they do sound awful.  A lot of homes built around 1998 and beyond just aren’t built to accommodate the noise and heat; compact footprints that pull the garage into and under living space and megabuilders cutting costs, to stay barely within code, allowing higher profit margins on 1,000 units.  Any amount of miners pulling more than 200 kW/day is going to be a logistics problem.  

Energy use IS a concern, I just disagree with your stance.  Your argument is too broad and fear based.  With your logic anyone using electricity “poorly” is a wasteful, selfish person.  I could point to major cities that charge a premium for electricity and say the millions that live there are making a selfish choice - based on my perspective; that’s a foolish and childish way to view other’s choices.  

But using miners that are blatantly inefficient due to mining difficulty and hashing power is equivalent to someone driving around in a 1960’s era car that belches pollution.  Sure, it’s gets the job done, but at what cost to everyone else?  I don’t want a bunch of mining machines pulling $6/day in electricity to make $6.50/day in BTC.

Mystere_Miner,"Well, first off... Using AC to cool miners is stupid, and wasteful.  It takes about as much power to cool them as it does to run them, so you're cutting your profitability to probably close to zero.

Second, There are ways to offset your carbon footprint.  Many places, even those that run on coal, offer ways to offset by subsidizing solar or wind.  Worst case, you can buy carbon credits.  

It sounds like he's not interested in that, but you are.  So if you were to mine, you would have options.  Also, there are hosting facilities that are based on natural gas (which isn't zero carbon, but it's a lot better than coal) or even wind based energy.  

Finally, the carbon footprint of fiat is huge.  You mentioned it vaguely, but that's not even scratching the surface.  Think of all the banks (and all the energy they use for each branch, plus headquarters, data centers, etc..), the employees driving to and from work in the financial industry, the servers for processing transactions, etc..  Even armored cars to move the money from place to place.  

It sounds like your biggest argument is the carbon footprint, but honestly, that's the easiest one to fix.",hr9ira7,rw3je7,/r/BitcoinMining/comments/rw3je7/unpopular_opinion/hr9ira7/,12,BitcoinMining,2022-01-04 21:15:45

WhiteDogNC,"I sorry, but my opinion is this.  

You need a C19/C20 12 (or 14) gauge power cord to a PDU (unbranded PDUs with a C19 outlet shouldn’t be more than $150) to an L6-30 receptacle.  Swapping out the dryer 10-30R for the L6-30 is not hard.  The PDU is worth the money, it protects from surges and distributes a clean flow of electricity increasing efficiency.  Finding the breaker for that dryer outlet would be smart too because a double pole 30a is better than single pole and I would want to verify that.  

Sounds like a lot of work and some lost money, but you have an expensive machine that will make you a lot of coin if you treat it right.

miner_cooling_trials,"TL;DR - you could do it, depending on household usage - it might reduce your ROI by ~15-20%. Your wife may divorce you from the heat/noise produced.

Solar generation in a daily cycle is roughly a bell curve. Your peak generation is when the sun is at its highest/shining most directly with your panels - and tapers off toward sundown. Kw/h you use during the generation is drawn direct from solar, and excess is sent to the grid - you know this already. An important data point is how much usage happens during generation hours. Do you know this already? If no one is home or you don’t have much of an electrical load during - it’ll mostly be all surplus. 

Let’s tackle your generation first. I’m assuming you have 10kw on your roof, which is about 33x300w panels. Each panel will generate 1.26kw/hr per day with the total system generating 42kw/hr [(source-FL)](https://diysolarshack.com/how-many-kwh-does-a-solar-panel-produce-per-day/). Interesting to note that you will get 4.25hrs per day peak generation in FL.

So then - let’s consider you purchase a S19J for about $12k. This runs about 3.1kw, or about 75kw/hr per day. [Asicminervalue](https://www.asicminervalue.com/miners/bitmain/antminer-s19j-pro-104th) currently has this machine profiting $6700/year at USD$0.12 per kw/hr electricity. 

So Let’s say that no one is really home during the day at your place, and you get 90% surplus of your 42kw/hr*0.9= 37.8. With the cost of running the miner, 75kw/hr - 37.8 available surplus = 37.2kw/hr you’ll need to draw from the grid. Assuming you pay $0.12kw/hr, this is $4.47/day. The machine has an income of $26.41 currently, so this makes your daily profitability $21.94, and reduces your time to ROI from 682 days to 546 - ~20% more efficient. Keep in mind, difficulty is ever increasing - and your profit will fluctuate according to this and BTC value. Important to note, this efficiency does not scale to purchasing more miners!

You’d need the additional $12k upfront capital, plus associated electrician costs to get 240v. Also, in this house you plan to live forever - does your significant other know how loud and noisy this ASIC is? Unless you have a secure outhouse far away, they will very likely have something (negative) to say about having an ASIC at home.",hrghqbi,rwsfb6,/r/BitcoinMining/comments/rwsfb6/should_i_mine_bitcoin_if_i_am_already_installing/hrghqbi/,2,BitcoinMining,2022-01-06 06:02:01

Subject_Technician89,"The S19 Pro 110 is making about $500/mo, on $0.11/kwh power cost. They're going for around $14k right now.

You need to do a cost analysis on your expected ROI, future value, etc, will be, and make your decision off of that. I tend to look at how much BTC a machine can mine, rather than what the BTC is worth currently. Sure, it's worth $500 at current prices. But it's worth $1,000 if BTC goes to $100k.

ASIC_Port,"Man, to answer you question: you need only 1 laptop.

BUT, there are many other factors to consider:

1. What miner are you getting? 20*S9 is like $11k, but you won’t be much profitable with 17c power rate. And 20*S19 is like $200k+.

2. How much power do you have available? Normal US home has 200amp service, and you should follow the 80% rule. Each S19 draws about 13A, so you could only safely run about 12 miners with no other power usage (ovens, washer, TVs, etc) at home.

3. These miners are running at 240V. You need to hire a electrician to modify the panel and add several 240V plugs for your mining operation.

4. You need PDU, power cables, and Ethernet cables to run each machine.

5. You need a dedicate place to keep them running without hearing the noise?

If you are in the US. The best solution for your 20*miners is to find a good hosting place near you with all in price. That instantly takes out problem 2-5. To my best knowledge their rates are well below 17c. So it will be a win-win.",hrisvw5,rxf4bm,/r/BitcoinMining/comments/rxf4bm/help/hrisvw5/,4,BitcoinMining,2022-01-06 18:14:36

crypto-lizard7665,"There's a lot of infrastructure involved in setting up a farm - from having the right power transformers and distribution, to HVAC, to internet to getting your ASICs setup and running. 

Shipping container systems solve some of that - mostly the build out for the HVAC and power distribution (of course depending on the model.) 

You'll still need internet and a big power feed for them. So the answer - put them where you have those things setup. Most residential doesn't have the high voltage equipment needed to support multiple current generation ASICs, so your backyard is probably not going to help much.

You will still have to have all the permits and whatever else is required to have a building that's pulling tons of electricity. 

 I've seen them successfully deployed in the back lot/storage area of industrial space, like an auto detailing shop or a machine shop.

ValuableShoulder5059,"Outfit a semi trailer yes. Haul it around not really unless it's like once per year. Solar panels no. Plug it in yes. Now is there anywhere where the power changes enough seasonally to make it worth hauling the miners? Maybe if you can find someplace like in texas that needs the heat (so free or split power bill) and doesn't mind the noise and haul it up north during summer to avoid the heat and air conditioning time of day load demands. 

Now a boat is a bit of a different story. If you can find a place that has a strong current and the ability to tie off a strong anchor. Now you have the ability to install a generator powered by the water flowing by. I think the lower mississippi runs like 6-7knots. That's a lot of juice on a homemade water wheel. Plus this power should be somewhat stable. Solar is only around half the day. Wind is usually only half the day at average and tends to blow late morning-early evening. Now let me explain ""a lot of juice"". About enough to power maybe two miners... Now as for hauling any size of boat around.... My personal ski boat gets something like 1.5mpg cruising at 30knots. Although I can slow down to a no wake speed of ~4knots and get 2 mpg. Boats are only efficient in hauling large weight long distances where there are no other options for transit. (Railroads have argued for years that the barges are subsided by tax payers paying for the locks, dams, and dredging, although the railroads aren't supper efficient themselves) 
Since I just thought of it, you could make a rail car miner. This is probably the best idea yet! You could power a lot of watts off the undercarriage of the car. Like a couple hundred miners worth. But you'll only get power when the car is rolling so it'll kill your uptime and I'm sure sooner or later the railroads will catch on. Also it's really expensive to ship a railcar anymore. Although you could buy a retired engine to use as a generator. These diesels run on off-road fuel and are almost as efficient as you can get. Plus it's already coupled to a generator, which with some minor wiring I'm sure you can hookup to the miners. You might get your cost as low as about 10 cents per kwh/h after a $500,000 investment in that generator.",hroe33n,ry0wm3,/r/BitcoinMining/comments/ry0wm3/would_it_be_possible_to_outfit_a_vehicle_with/hroe33n/,3,BitcoinMining,2022-01-07 19:27:59

underworld_doom,"That's within normal variance.  Mining isn't perfect and the work the pool sends for your miner to do may be easier (you get faster hashrate) or harder (its slower) - its all random. 

There may also be a few ""wasted"" hashes - either because the miner spent some (small) amount of time working on old problems when new work came in.

Antminer T17+: $2,500

So all of the machines we offer will have gone through our proprietary repair process that makes buying these 17 models feasible again. I can’t guarantee you “x” amount of longevity obviously, but I can guarantee you there will be no dysfunction from heat sinks including any shifting/moving around. Which we all know is the most annoying thing about these models due to the low temp. solder used in about 40% of the factory Bitmain models if I’m not mistaken. 

Our prices are based around an average price of $/TH. And yes while Bitcoin is low, I believe ASIC sales stay high because nobody sees the drop and goes “I don’t believe in BTC anymore” everyone sees the drop and goes “ooo, let me try and buy a miner” and then are surprised when you explain to them the price of btc is only 1 variable of how miners get prices, and tbh it’s not the most critical variable.

Bitcoin_Barons,"I had this exact same problem. I just recently bought several s19J 100TH from compass and they are underhashing by 10% (90TH per day). This is not in the normal variance expected 3-4%.

I have these pointed to a chinese pool (f2pool), so my thoughts are either compass is selling faulty machinery on their marketplace (the miners were 2 months old with 10 months warranty) when I bought, or the chinese pool is underreporting hash rate.

I have other miners with them that are hashing at the correct rate, but these were brand new. These ones  pointing to slushpool.

Overall, I would give this company 7/10 (due to delays and other factors), probably only good for people with less than 5 miners.

I will probably give these miners 1 more week, and if they are still underhashing I will point to a different pool. If  they are underhashing on the other pool, the machinery sold by compass was ""underperforming hardware"" and they are not screening their marketplace properly.",hrxr7cu,rz46wi,/r/BitcoinMining/comments/rz46wi/bitcoin_mining_hashrate_question_antminer_s19j/hrxr7cu/,2,BitcoinMining,2022-01-09 17:26:10

carsongwalker,"The main issue i see with these kinda of calculators is the following:

Assuming a fairly typical 4%-6% difficulty increase every month for a year or so is a good guess of how difficulty will increase. However, when you extrapolate this to long period such as 5 years, you will very quickly see how absolutely OUT OF THIS WORLD the hashrate prediction becomes. Lets do a quick shorthand example:

After 3 years of 6% difficulty increases, the hashrate will roughly 8x (1.06³⁶), meaning around 1600EH (200EH × 8) for the entire network. Thats a bit crazy in of itself, but continuing... According to this model the next difficulty period increasing another 6% would result in AN INCREASE IN NETWORK HASHRATE EQUAL TO 100EH (1600EH × 0.06). 

You can not be in your right mind and think that in 3 years we will be adding 100EH per month to the network hashrate, that is 50% of today's entire network. Take a good look at today's semiconductor industry and how it is unable to even support today's demand with a global hashrate of 200EH...

I suggest throwing out the exponential increase models, or at least being very conservative when picking percent increases for time periods longer than 1-2 years.

Mystere_Miner,"No.  When they say it will cost you more than you will earn, they mean it will cost you x amount and you will earn 0.  You cannot mine bitcoin with a gpu, it would take you 1000 years to earn a single penny, while paying (in the case of a 1060 which draws 120W @ .05/KWh or $0.006 per hour, or $0.144 per day for 0 reward for 1000 years.

Even if your power was free, your card will die before you make a single cent.  Hell, you will die before you make a single cent.

Now, $0.05/kwh is cheap if you had an asic miner, but an asic miner is 10-110 TH/s, while I don't know what hashrate your 1060 can run at with sha256, it's at not much compared to an asic.

EDIT: Looks like a 1060 can do about 1478.3 MH/s of sha256, which seems like a lot, but it's not.

An S19 Pro is 110TH/s or .0000134391 (roughly) times less powerful.  In other words, you would have to mine 50,000 days or 136 years just to match 1 day of that asic miner.  And that asic miner only makes $25/day right now.

miner_cooling_trials,"I’m pretty sure you’re just looking for a rise, not actually meaning what you say.. Your statement is assertive but totally not based in reality. If you really believed this, you’d be doing it.

The last GPU I could find with a SHA256 hash rate measured was the GTX680 @ 120MH. This GPU is on eBay for USD$170. A used S9 at 13.5TH will set you back about $600. 

Your single GPU will mine Bitcoin at 0.00012TH. So, you’ll need 112,500 GTX680s. At market rate  that’s $19.1m. You’ll need a factory to house them, not to mention motherboards, CPUs, ram, power supplies, shelving.. that’s so you can meet the shitty hash rate of a S9 - which at todays rates, is not profitable. I won’t bother with the ROI on this due to the massive number of factors.

Then you take the cellphone equation. There a YouTube vid [(link)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deCeY_r96EE) from May 21, 2021 and the dude says he did this on his android and got a couple of cents to a couple of dollars a month. So, an Android flagship is about $1000. Say you got $5 per month, that’s $0.16/day. You ROI in 6250 days or 17 years.

indy_trckstr,"I started with Compass and am getting into home mining as well. My reasons:
- The machines were cheaper through Compass (months ago and/or bundles)
- They can host at 1/3-1/2 my rate
- They have the physical space as well as electrical and cooling capacity

Downsides to Compass:
- Not your hash, not your stash
- Downtime
- Weird feeling of having someone else babysit your machines with no nanny cam
- Won’t be mining for weeks at best. Months more likely or even up to 1 year for your last VIP bundle to go online

The Compass contract is for a year so maybe I’ll re-up or (hopefully) I’ll have them ship them to me so I can setup my own farm. However that’ll require building out space, having electrical and cooling capacity, noise mitigation, etc. Mining at home is not trivial. For comparison, my electric energy usage was about 1200 kWh last month. A single S19 will use around 2300 kWh in a single month, tripling my bill. At some usage point, you need your electrical service provider to upgrade the lines to your house, transformer, etc.

I’m sure there are some calculators out there which show the potential benefits of having Compass your miner(s) vs just buying Bitcoin in terms of profits. I’ve made one, but it’s not very good or worth sharing.",hsj34o4,s35lka,/r/BitcoinMining/comments/s35lka/is_hosted_mining_a_good_way_to_get_started/hsj34o4/,2,BitcoinMining,2022-01-13 19:58:52

Plug in your cost of power, the cost of the miner, etc and you'll see how profitable mining can be.

Good machines operating in well-managed facilities can last for many years, the newer generation ASICS like the S19s are expected to last at least 5 years. Older miners may still be profitable but it depends on its history, how it was managed, etc.

lunar_lounge,"Appreciate the effort here. A few notes/questions:

1. Please launch a client reseller marketplace, similar to what Compass offers. The KZ issues (electricity, riots, internet shutoff) gave us a glimpse as to what value Wattum will be offering for our machines when our contracts come to an end, with the initial offers being 40% or more of a markdown off machines purchased just months earlier. Just like with cars, you will get more through a private sale of second hand goods vs going with the dealer's offer. I believe Compass takes %10 cut on a resale but I would rather have that option than not. And it lets the management company get a cut on the sale too. Win/win, potentially.
2. Drop the management fees per machine on existing contracts. The energy behind some of the Wattum statements in this post seem based on reluctance. I'm trying to be fair but I feel it's true. There are mentions of ""finally trying to get in touch with the community"" and not ""actively engaged within the community"" for ""several years"" in this very post by Wattum reps. I appreciate the honesty, but it really is a slap in the face for the expected value when clients perpetually pay extra money per month. That extra revenue isn't translating into anything tangible.
3. Roadmap, roadmap, roadmap ... ie what is actually coming? What are the next two big roadmap items that Wattum will roll out in 2022? We don't have a dashboard portal right now, except for tickets filed, which is separate from our user accounts.

Der_Toaster_,"I did some calculations for myself back in the days which answers your question:

3090 is IMO out of the question as it is just the longest ROI due to worse Watt/MH and $/MH compared to the other cards. 

3070 has Watt/MH but 3080 better $/MH. 

Therefore you should go for 3080 IMO as efficiency does not play a factor when not paying for electricity.

Beware tho that I did those calculations some time ago based on EU € prices.

It depends on what deals you are getting rn for yourself but 3080 should still have the lead with the combo of $/MH and Watt/MH. It's very close to the 3070 tho, so if you get better $ deals for the 3070 it will most likely edge out the 3080

Firstly it is a totally different business and has totally different capital and risk requirements to either broker ASICs and hosting space (like Compass) vs. buying them up for yourself. Like big time day and night difference. 

Secondly the miners that actually new and sold by Compass directly are fairly priced. 

Those crazy deals you are talking about are just Compass customers who highball their prices in the hope to make a huge (and unfair) margin on their already owned ASIC. But that does not relate to ""those firms charging you more etc."". It's just ridiculous pricing by a secondary reseller. 

Other big companies like ""Blockware"" etc. are also fairly priced.

CrapWereAllDoomed,"Are you hung up specifically on bitcoin, or crytpocurrency in general?  The problem that you're going to run into is that anything you buy at that price point for mining bitcoin is going to be on the second/third/fourth hand market and you'll be buying used gear that's been mining away for the last 2-4 years.  

This is around the expected lifespan of the hardware under the best conditions, so you might not even get 2 years out of it to get your initial investment back.  That doesn't even begin to cover the amount of scammers out there who you place an order from and a device never arrives.  

If you're just interested in cryptocurrency in general I'd look at a Bitmain L3+.  They're running somewhere between 1500 and 2000 right now and netting somewhere around $60/month give or take.  I'd recommend using a known reseller such as bt-miners if you decide to go that route.

Best advice I can give you is avoid buying hardware on shitcoins that are paying decent profits today. Stick to Bitcoin regardless of profitability, the hardware you buy today will likely sell for more than what you initially paid 4 years from now. Most of these other coins will be wasted away by then. 

GPU mining is about to experience a massive disturbance when Ethereum goes PoS, no one knows how it'll play out so you have at worst 6 months to ROI whatever you buy today. Don't buy Ethereum ASIC's, those will be paper weights in 6 months time and you'll never ROI those machines.

bitcornminerguy,"This is obviously very well thought out on your end, and very specific to your situation. But might I suggest you're over-thinking it just a bit?

Go ahead and order the machines... get them on the way. Do your best to get the electrical and Internet setup while they're in transit. If they arrive before you're ready... a few more lost days won't kill you. I wouldn't suggest running them in your living room... but hey... go for it if you think you can handle it. (Do you have 220v electricity in your living room, though?)

You'll be alright. It seems a LOT of new miners feel like they have to ROI in some particular period of time, or somehow this is all not worth it. Zoom out a bit... take a slightly longer view... you'll be okay. Get them up and running properly when you're able to, and you'll be okay.

Also don't forget when making your ROI calculations that the miners will have some kind of resale value 12-15 months from now. Even if its $2000-$3000 per machine, that's a decent rebate on what you spent. Focus more on how much you can mine and KEEP for later. When BTC hits $150k - $250k you'll be happy you've got a bag waiting, and suddenly all this ROI math will have seemed silly.

fuandcongrats,"I got you. 

You’re gonna need a place preferably away from where you sleep to mine unless you go the GPU route. There are two main different kinds of cryptocurrency miners, ASIC and GPU. ASIC’s are loud, use lots of power, and are generally expensive. I have a few and I personally love them. Some of them use non standard outlets such as 120v like a washing machine plugs into. That can cost more if an electrician is needed for some reason (upgrading breakers etc). Don’t let this scare you away; but ASIC’s generally take up more room and more power but can make up for that in profitability. 
GPU’s (graphics processing unit’s) are smaller units with lower power requirements generally and lower profitability; hence people buy more of them. Normally racks are built or purchased and aligned properly so the GPU’s can have considerable airflow throw out the rack. This seems to be a good a better start for beginners nowadays just because the simplicity of GPU’s and obtaining them. ASIC’s are mostly made in China and can be hard to get new for a reasonable price. These GPU’s came mine different algorithms than ASIC’s and that can be a huge upside or downside as they don’t mine BTC (sha-256)

I would recommend buying a prebuilt GPU mining rig if on the lower range of starting capital or a solid batch of ASIC’s if you have the time, and the money.

I just wanted to add that their are other ASIC’s out there too that mine other algorithms and those could be worth your time as-well.

Thru these miners you will be building your total hash rate and that pretty much is the number of hashes per second you are putting towards the chain. The more hashes you put forth; the more you make.",htgcvvz,s8ewdw,/r/BitcoinMining/comments/s8ewdw/trying_to_get_into_mining/htgcvvz/,1,BitcoinMining,2022-01-20 13:13:34
levicam,"Short answer, yes, but depends on how many watts the 220V is needed to pull. Most 110/120V outlets are 15A which means they can support up to 1440W (80% rule) on a constant basis. That wattage won’t change if you go to 220/240V so as long as you’re not pulling more wattage then max you should be ok. 

But I agree with other, in the long run it’s worth it to pull 220/240V plus a good step up transformer will run you at least $100.",htgetl1,s7tolp,/r/BitcoinMining/comments/s7tolp/would_a_stepupdown_converter_allow_me_to_safely/htgetl1/,1,BitcoinMining,2022-01-20 13:29:56

crypto-lizard7665,"First, you need a synced node connected to the bitcoin network.

Next, you need a stratum proxy. Stratum is the protocol that accepts connections from your asic and distributes work to it from your node. 

There's a couple - you can use bfgminer, or you can setup a solo pool like ckpool.

You can get BFG here: [http://bfgminer.org/](http://bfgminer.org/)

You can get the ckpool solo source code here: [https://bitbucket.org/ckolivas/ckpool-solo/src/master/](https://bitbucket.org/ckolivas/ckpool-solo/src/master/)

Once you have the proxy setup, you can connect to the IP address of that proxy from your miner.

&amp;#x200B;

In addition to the difficulty making it extremely unlikely to find a block, your connections to the network will not likely be numerous or fast enough to successfully communicate you found a block. A bigger pool with more peers will most likely beat you and orphan your block. 

You can see this without setting up anything more than your node - look at a big pool that has the current block, and see how much faster they update when a new block is found than your local node.",htmamwg,s93qnb,/r/BitcoinMining/comments/s93qnb/flying_true_solo_with_btc/htmamwg/,3,BitcoinMining,2022-01-21 16:55:35

In short, shell out $8-16k for an ASIC. You’re electric costs depend where you live, but estimate $200-500/month and bring in $400-800/month in mining revenue. Would be 18-24 months before you’ve hit profitability on the miner. This doesn’t take into account changes in difficulty, faulty equipment, etc. 

Right now with BTC down and the price of miners remaining high, it’s prob best to just buy BTC directly unless you get a good deal or have close to free electricity. 

Edit: if you are asking about mining with your PC or GPU mining there’s another sub for that. Don’t think it’s profitable anymore, but I’m not versed in that space.",htncnwg,s9k3tg,/r/BitcoinMining/comments/s9k3tg/new_to_the_mining_world_how_much_can_you/htncnwg/,1,BitcoinMining,2022-01-21 20:47:36

FightingFools,"Its not easy to set up your own mining farm (which is what you would need to generate 1 BTC every month).  To earn about 1 BTC a month, you would need 50+ S19 miners. You need cheap electricity (at least .08 KWH, but closer to .04), a place to put a bunch of loud, heat generating miners (or spend a ton of money on immersion cooling) and a lot of up front capital.  To run about 50+ S19s, plan to spend at least $20,000 in electrical upgrades.  Then add the cost of the miners themselves. So, look to spend $500,000+ to get your 1BTC a month mining operation up and running.  Of course there are ways to scale up to 1 BTC, but if you want to make a splash right away, you need lots of cash!

If I was making $75K a year, and just getting into mining (and I had an ok electrical rate - .12KWH or better),  I would jut buy one, see what it takes into getting it operational.  If after 6 months it looks like it will be profitable, move forward on bigger plan (maybe scale up to 10?).",htnf8iy,s9k3tg,/r/BitcoinMining/comments/s9k3tg/new_to_the_mining_world_how_much_can_you/htnf8iy/,1,BitcoinMining,2022-01-21 21:02:56

miner_cooling_trials,"Can you elaborate the math for paying zero electricity, I’ve never seen anyone prove their solar investment for mining is a good idea. You say this is an investment opportunity so let’s break down the finances.

Some figures to start with.
L7 = 3.425kw * 200 = 342.5 * 24 = 8220kw/hr consumption per day.

Electric rate, let’s be optimistic and say $0.07. So, base electric cost ignoring solar generation is $575/day * 30 = $17250/month.

Current profitability of a L7 per day is $59 (yes I know it’s a bad day..) but you have 100 of these mythical bad boys, so you earn $5900/day * 30 = $177,000/month.

So ignoring other fixed costs such as rent, wages and downtime (which absolutely needs to be planned for) you will profit $177-17.25 = $159.75k per month. To break even on your $2m mining investment, it will take 12.5 months. 

Unless your electric is much more than this, do you really need the solar array? I’ll run these figs next, what country/state are you in?

visionridge,"At the levels you are considering there significantly more variables to consider. Plus I have serious doubts on your estimates. I'd suggests seriously ramping up your research.

Update: wow some numb nut already voted down.
Based on 85% PF (power factor) 600 amps of 480 3-phase can handle ~121 of those L7. 400 amps too little. Ignoring the cost of battery infrastructure you can find empty buildings with power panels and transformers for that load but there's cost of leasing you haven't factored in.

Of course going solar means space to place or land depending on max power. Based on 3500w per machine and solar panel output in sunny cities around 5.5 kWh/m2/day it will take almost 0.4 of acre just for panels. Add in additional power needs and the fact the panels won't be edge to edge you are looking for at least 3/4 acre so leasing is out leaving buying land and building. 

Oh yeah don't forget building permits.

And your power needs no where near 2.5MW. If the were then you will have many additional hurdles. A very common power spec for buildings for comparison, is 600 amp 480 3-phase. Assuming 85% PF that's actual work of ~0.4 MW. I looked at a 76k sq. ft. building. Had 2000 amps and a million dollar annual lease. That's only 1.4 MW. Fortunately for you your power needs are FAR less than you calculate.

Also if you don't know what 480 3-phase, PF, PDU, and a dozen other power related items are then you need more research.

Bottom line: You are overlooking cost of land, facility build, and a few more things.

For the record, I help design things like this.",htsficj,s9yy7c,/r/BitcoinMining/comments/s9yy7c/is_investing_35m_into_a_mining_farm_a_bad_idea/htsficj/,12,BitcoinMining,2022-01-22 20:51:18

endlessinquiry,"I’m not totally following the whole photon thing, but let me see if I can contribute anything to this conversation.  

First and foremost, game theory will be the most important consideration for any new system of mining.   Game theory in it’s simplest form just says that the most cost effective way to solve sha256 hashes will dominate.  I’m not sure what other considerations there are, but anything that gives a financial edge will become popular.  

With this in mind, unless your photon system can process sha256 faster and/or cheaper than existing asics, I’m not sure anyone will care.  

Currently asics are valued by how many hashes they can pricess per watt, which is how it’s profitability can be calculated.  As miners become
more efficient, older miners, which process less hashes/watt become unprofitable unless electricity is sufficienlty inexpensve.    

You need to calculate the price of a product that can produce sha256 hashes, and see if that product can have an upfront and operational cost that is cometitive with the existing technology.

Iceathlete,If you want to be net zero on energy usage your solar farm is going to have to be 4 to 5 times larger than your power usage.

IGotThisYo,"Super complex topic and I’m sure others could chime in with better feedback but I think, theoretically, it is possible, however, there could be issues eventually with something like bitcoin mining specifically and when and how it’s put into practice. 

I think probably the biggest issue is, with bitcoin you have the difficulty adjustment that would eventually come into play. Sure it could process at ultra high speed but then eventually mining difficulty would adjust and make it harder to solve, in order to maintain the 10 minute solve times for blocks. 

Another issue could be how much, in orders of magnitude, an increase in hashrate a miner like this would have compared to traditional ASICs. If the increase in hashrate is substantial enough, it’s possible it could make other traditional ASICs obsolete, thus making it more likely hashrate becomes centralized unless it’s affordable enough and the technology is available to more than just a select few. It would have to be just as cost effective to build and manufacture as more traditional ASIC mining hardware.",htvadcv,sab5yk,/r/BitcoinMining/comments/sab5yk/an_idea_that_could_increase_the_efficiency_of/htvadcv/,1,BitcoinMining,2022-01-23 11:21:12

Each miner has two power supplies so you need two outlets. Combined I am looking at 14-15 amps per miner so 7amps per outlet. Since my panel has the room I did each outlet on its own 20amp breaker. I am running 6-20P outlets. I also use them for other equipment in my business so this configuration works great for me.  


The heat and noise though at a business will be an issue. Well the heat is why they are in my shop. I am using them to heat this place all winter.

You can approach those two ways.

1. Be sneaky, buy and install ASICs and pray the person paying the electric bill doesn’t notice.
2. Be upfront, tell the bill payer/landlord. Don’t have to say you are building a mining farm, you could say ‘our operation is scaling up and anticipates a sharp rise in our electric consumption’. See how they react.

RegularSufficient132,"investing $3.5m into mining farm isn't bad idea if you cover all aspects of the project, 

first thing first (the mighty Antminer L7) till this point nobody from who pre-order L7 receive it

November and December 2021 batches has pushed to February 2022. nobody saw L7 physically not even in the Bitmain summit that held in UAE, if you contact bitmain they'll say basically we don't have it in stock and you can't pre-order now, once pre-order is available will contact you.. that's for Antminer L7.. if you see it working somewhere i would love to see it i'll appreciate if you share ... antminer L7 nowhere to be found in the nutshell. sorry for that rant about L7. but i wasted a lot of my time on L7 and to find (there is no L7) is not easy to handle 

for the power infrastructure for mining using solar panels is  extremally expansive, solar panels need around 3.5 hectares,  transformer, energy storage and the cabling ( 200 euro per meter for a cabling ) from the main grid to your facility, so take in consideration the nearest power station to you

cooling for miners, if you going for air cooling, you need take consideration environmental factor dust, plus the facility or containers where you are placing the miners  

if you are cooling using immersion cooling there is way more additional cost but the overclocking option in on the table and you are reducing maintenance operation and cost

Subject_Technician89,"Can we make sure you've 100% troubleshot? I have some T2T 25Ts that have this same issue, and yes annoyingly their firmware blocks the logs. Even Innomonitor doesn't show you much.

Start by swapping board 2 with either board 1 or 3. Both PSU connection and data cable. You can either move the power cables over to board 1's position and vice versa board 1 to board w power, or u can physically swap the board positions within the machine and hook it all up. If it still shows only boards 1 and 3, then you've ruled out a bad board and bad data cables. This means either the controlboard port 2 is bad, or the PSU supply for board 2 is bad. Most likely the PSU.

If that's the case, you'll need to buy a new PSU. Shoot me a message, I think I have a few that would work for your machine and I'll sell them chChe.

If it shows boards 2 and 3 up once you swap, you might have a bad hashboard unfortunately. Swap data cables to rule out a bad data cable.

Take this personal example - I bought L3+’s in the first half of last year for USD$600ea. By the second half, they were becoming unprofitable, but they started selling for USD$1500+ a pop. So, I sold them all and made many more times profit than I ever mined with them. I can’t really explain why the jump in value, given the shitty profitability of a 4yr old miner.

AndrewAwakened,"Prices for miners are extremely inflated right now, and miner efficiency is important, because the bitcoin algorithm increases the difficulty of mining bitcoin based on the total hashrate of miners active on the network. So older miners earn less and less as newer miners come online, and after awhile they cost more in electricity to operate than the value of the coin they are mining. 

With your electricity costs being so high to begin with I don’t see how you could make a profit with older asic  miners at the current levels of mining difficulty. It might even be difficult with newer miners.

Maybe you should look into GPU based mining instead? That approach uses a lot less power, so maybe it might be easier to make a profit? Maybe you could even set up solar power and use that to reduce your effective per kWH rate? 

One last thing to consider is the value of bitcoin and other crypto currencies. It has taken a huge tumble recently, and it often does, but some people expect that in general it will increase in value hugely over time, and so they are willing to mine at a loss for years with the expectation that they will come out with huge profits on the other end when the value of crypto’s skyrocket.",huaew57,sd4nug,/r/BitcoinMining/comments/sd4nug/5000_usd_mining_budget_how_and_where_to_start/huaew57/,5,BitcoinMining,2022-01-26 13:05:54

One way ive been growing it is to buy miners in bulk, go through them, get them cleaned and running well.  We update the os and get the best hash rate we can. Then i sell them for a decit profit and buy more. Right now ive kinda stopped cuz i cant source any at a decent price anymore. But we have our last 30 antminer s9 sold for about the 600 mark to 1 guy. If you do it right there is money. Lots of repairs need to be in house. You dont ship it out till you have multuple to fix that are above your skill level. When you do ship it out every piece of the miner you send better need repair.  Yes itll cost more to fix an s9 with 3 bad hash boards and a bad main board but not as much as fixing 4 miners with 1 bad board. Again just my thoughts. Even with the down turn our l3+ and our s9's are profitable. To many people want to plug these in 1 or 2 at a time and make money. Thats when its not worth it.

Boring_Horror_6232,"TLDR: $65/Th

I would go into buying a bitcoin miner expecting a return on investment of 1yr. When calculating a good price for your miners, you want to consider the machine hashrate, price of bitcoin, and rate of return for 1Th based on current mining difficulty.

Let’s consider the Antminer S19j Pro 104Th/s
I would use this formula to figure out a reasonable price to buy this miner at:
Price = Th  x BTC Price x Yearly BTC produced per TH

= 104Th x $37,000 x 0.00174 BTC/yr/Th
= $6,695
In the current market conditions, I would pay $6,695 for this miner. 

Right now, the market price for this machine is $11,500. If we used this formula to work backwards we can see that this would be a reasonable price for the miner if the price of BTC was $63,500. 

What this formula accomplishes is that this miner can generate $6,695 revenue at current prices in a year, electric and maintenance cost are not included in calculation as it varies per person. 

1Th/s should cost you 1Th x 0.00174 x $37,000 = $65/Th

Hope this helps and it’s never too late to stack sats🤑",huj92th,sed3by,/r/BitcoinMining/comments/sed3by/how_much_is_a_good_price_per_th/huj92th/,6,BitcoinMining,2022-01-28 03:23:38
AsicJungle,"It depends on the model and quantity. The machine price is also correlated to bitcoin price and difficulty, so it tends to go up and down.

S9 prices, on the other end, tend to be a bit less elastic as most of them are going to places with super cheap or free electricity (Venezuela), where they get breaken-even on in a matter of 4-5 months.",hujff9l,sed3by,/r/BitcoinMining/comments/sed3by/how_much_is_a_good_price_per_th/hujff9l/,1,BitcoinMining,2022-01-28 04:12:23

levicam,"It's varied tremendously depending on the miner and algo used. My fastest ROI has been on scrypt miners (specifically the L3+/++) and I have generally been in the 6 month range on paying off the miner, then everything after that is gravy.

I also run SHA256 miners (S17 Pro's) and they were slightly longer but still under a year. I have 59TH versions and they were about 1/4 the cost of a S19 110TH (roughly $3k vs $12k) and two of them mine more than one S19 110TH. So theoretically I paid half price for slightly more hash rate. Additionally, combined, two S17 59TH only use 4200W with hiveOS, while one S19 110TH uses 3250W so not much more power costs.

The few GPU's I have are running ethash and they took almost a year as well. I'm not big on GPU mining.

All miners I bought were second hand (except GPUs) at the time and continue to do well.

I generally upgrade after a miner has been around a year or two, can usually get a much better price and decrease your time to profitability. All this doesn't take into account the depreciation you can write off as well when you capitalize assets. That's another benefit. Plus hang on to your crypto, someday it can be 5-10x, or half what it is today, but odds are it's going up.",hulltfa,sefz25,/r/BitcoinMining/comments/sefz25/bitcoin_mining_roi/hulltfa/,1,BitcoinMining,2022-01-28 16:27:38

bitcornminerguy,"I think all of crypto comes with some kind of dream and hope for a future that looks different than what we all have TODAY.

I've been mining since mid-2017, except for a few month break in 2018 when I moved. I regret that downtime! For me... its both a short-term and long-term game, though when push comes to shove... the long game is where my head is. Most of the time, my mining operation is profitable. I define that as being able to pay its monthly expenses (electricity, small commercial rent, and small salary paid to me) and still have Bitcoin left to add to a stack for the future. That future stack is the end goal. Every week that bag gets a little bigger... some weeks more than others. In times like right now, where my short-term profitability is stunted by the current price of Bitcoin, I take no salary, and pay some of the electricty, but wind up stashing MORE Bitcoin per week. The electric costs become my investment towards that future goal.

Every miner is different. I see a LOT of new guys obsessed with as instant an ROI on the machine costs as possible. I get why they see that, but I think its flawed logic to make it the primary investment consideration. If you're in it for the long term, you will absolutely ROI your equipment... but that stash of Bitcoin could be worth so, so much more.

We all have our strike points, too. For me, I will sell a % of my Bitcoin at $255k, $501k, $750k, and $1,000,001. But each time I am only selling a percentage of the bag, and I expect there will be periods in between each price point where I'm still mining, and thus replenishing the bag. I'm a ""never say never"" guy - so I don't know if there's a strike point where I just sell ALL of my coin... but the primary goal for mining is to make that bag as big as I can. The monthly salary is helpful income for my family (its a very modest amount) and the fact that it usually covers its own electricity costs... works out well for me. I'm still grinding away sats.",humzyzq,sewdz6,/r/BitcoinMining/comments/sewdz6/is_bitcoin_mining_a_race_to_the_bottom/humzyzq/,4,BitcoinMining,2022-01-28 21:41:35

Kn-ijk,"Everything is theoretically possible if properly addressed, and that can be a very cool project.

*Not possible from buying 2 antminers, pull them out of the box, pack everything up in a suitcase and go.*

The ONLY real discriminant is money. How much is your budget?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Not miners but GPUs, and not Bitcoin but Ethereum for a briefcase module.

GPUs usage solves electricicty problems (voltage,wattage, type of PSU needed, power usage (about x1.5/x2 consumptions of a high-end gaming computer running 24h not on idle), scalability, plug type, *the minimum quantity of computational power needed that 99% of miners can't provide in 2022*), and the heat exchange can be easily controlled.

In addition, there are plenty of Distros (OS) to remote control the RIG,switch pools and do everything related to management. For an example see: [https://hiveon.com/os/](https://hiveon.com/os/)

The internet connection is not a problem, there are several solutions. Mining does not require high volumes of data, quite the opposite. The real question is: how safe and stable is the wifi connection provided by hotels? (generally speaking), so we have to cover both cases in the most appropriate way (local wifi - mobile data). - btw easily addressable.

Noise will not be a problem at all, the heat dissipation with fans (air) is totally inadequate for a portable module, the RIG will be liquid-cooled.

The pool: Ethermine: [https://ethermine.org](https://ethermine.org) is fine, but the best choice is Binance: [https://www.binance.com](https://www.binance.com) native pool to eliminate the ""problem"" of having a hot wallet and having to wait to reach the trashold of the pool to transfer money from the pool to your hot wallet (to put it simple: ready to use e-cash).

&amp;#x200B;

Important to mention: GPUs are reliable, with the implementation on ""old"" cryptos or the launch of new coins with PoS, mining the same coin for long periods will not be the best choice in terms of profitability, GPUs can be used to mine a variety of cryptos (efficiency could be affected), switching whenever you want.

an insight here: [https://repository.psau.edu.sa/jspui/retrieve/4eeae047-64d2-4d01-938c-82059aa39e0b/PoSVsPoW.pdf](https://repository.psau.edu.sa/jspui/retrieve/4eeae047-64d2-4d01-938c-82059aa39e0b/PoSVsPoW.pdf)

&amp;#x200B;

All other related problems are addressable. (like weight, reduction of fragility,custom FWs to increase selectively the computational efficiency for specific algorithms).

&amp;#x200B;

So, is it feasible? Yes, by working on your initial idea.

&amp;#x200B;

**Send me a message if you are interested in all the details and try to work on it, i'm not going to work on it publicly in this thread/post to not clog it.** *If you are interested and before sending me a message you want to ask some preliminary questions, feel free to write them here, in this thread.*

**I like to work on new projects and increase my knowledge, I don't want anything in return.**

&amp;#x200B;

To clarify: don't expect billions of dollars flowing. Beer money? Absolutely yes, even a bit more for a 24h run per cycle.

If you fly between jobs expect a security check for a ""potential b0mb"", anything else is fine :).

&amp;#x200B;

\*This to get in motion a sample that works for beer money. A different plainfield would be to reverse engineer the innosilicon a11 pro (tricky, but definitely an interesting opportunity and feasible): [https://www.asicminervalue.com/miners/innosilicon/a11-pro-eth-2000mh](https://www.asicminervalue.com/miners/innosilicon/a11-pro-eth-2000mh), with appropriate implementations it would become your second salary in a briefcase. As i said the real discriminant is money.

&amp;#x200B;

\*To be clear on another aspect of the post. Yes, money is the discriminat to see what can be made and there is a minimum threshold, but, keep in mind that the ""briefecase module"" will be an object that prints from nowher beer money in a cyberpunk-style and this *come with a cost,* so why not save money instead and buy beers with them?. In terms of ROI, is scalable yes, but it won't get the job done with Ethereum, it can be reused as a good starting point for expanding a RIG, but minig other coins, in this way the ROI make sense.

&amp;#x200B;

*The ""innosilicon a11 pro briefcase module"" solves the ""problems"" pointed out in the 2 previous points of this post\*.*

&amp;#x200B;

A different situation is if you already have the hardware. If this is the case we can try to work on it in the same way i wrote previously in this post, the discriminant now is the computational power you can provide (we can work on efficency but if the hardware is too old there is not much to do with it).",hus3exk,sfu0dj,/r/BitcoinMining/comments/sfu0dj/i_have_free_electricity_if_i_can_build_a_small/hus3exk/,3,BitcoinMining,2022-01-29 23:10:40

&amp;#x200B;

*I was intrigued by the idea and started working on it.*

&amp;#x200B;

The prototype for the ""beer money briefcase module"" is ready, theoretically speaking.

All precautions have been taken into consideration.

Heat exchange, static electricity protection, plumbing of the liquid cooling system and basically everything that needs to be considered. Weight: under 9kg. (i'm not going to leave details here, if someone is curious just send me a message, no problems in sharing).

All fits in something like shown in the following image. (pictures in comments are not supported, so if you want to see just send me a message).

The price for the ""beer money printer"", with current prices, inlfueced by inflaction due to semicondutors shortage, is a little under 13k, without inflated prices a little under 4k.

After some back and forth trips, and a delivery, and after some digging scooping shoveling...
My son and I got alot done this weekend. I'm really proud and excited. We get our gravel Friday. I'll be heading back tomorrow afternoon to do some touching up stuff while we wait for our rock. 
And we are off. It seem like it's taking forever and it seems like we are making progress faster than I thought lol🤷🏻‍♂️. 

We still have so much work to do. But nothing else to do. So we work. For our future, for security for our family. This is going to be huge big big big for my family. I can't wait to go back and find something to do. 

When I'm not there I'm thinking about interior design of the shed. I'm feeling better everyday. Seeing how things will come together. I wish I could just get everything together on site at once. If probably just sleep there lol. I keep telling myself be patient, enjoy every second of the process.  Accept whatever and move forward. Stay calm.  Don't worry. 

Lots of heavy lifting coming up. Going to be moving 3 tons of gravel into the pad. Boring stuff. I'll touch base with you guys again maybe after the weekend. Once we get gravel down things will pick up, I'll get that shed installed, then...

I'll start completely over. Remove the old shed. Set another gravel pad foundation. Then I'll have them mining shed brought in and set down. THEN... The real fun will begin.
So yeah.. Lots of work, endless desire to get through it.

TheMiningExperience,"Thank you guys for your responses.  This is how to find the subnet mask, default gateway, and DNS server on windows (which you'll need for static IP settings)  

1. open up command prompt from start menu
2. Type ipconfig/all and press the enter key
3. Information will start to show in the window
4. Find ""subnet mask."" You'll need this number
5. Find ""default gateway."" You'll need this number
6. Find ""dns server."" You'll need this number

In the antminer dashboard you can input these numbers into the fields after you select static IP. Use the same ip address as the present automatically assigned one.  

This will keep you IP from switching automatically after so many days.",huxwkh6,sgni75,/r/BitcoinMining/comments/sgni75/can_somebody_explain_how_to_make_ip_stop_changing/huxwkh6/,1,BitcoinMining,2022-01-31 02:33:03

It's not a purchase that makes sense at this point.  Anyone wanting to drop $14k on a miner would be better off buying BTC at todays $37.7 and wait for it to go up.  

I got as far as installing a 30amp circuit and PDU before prices dropped.  After doing the math I've just went ahead and bought BTC instead buying miners.

Having an oversized breaker AND oversized wiring to your miners is recommended and safer. You have to upgrade both though. Putting in a higher amp breaker without updating the wires will make your wires catch on fire since the breaker won’t trip at higher amps.

Each miner requires a 2 pole 20 amp breaker for 240V. I assume you are using NEMA 6-20p duplex receptacles per unit? each 20 amp breaker should be using at a minimum a 12 AWG wire. and that electrican is off his hopper becuase code requires the wire to be sized for an 80% load. 80 percent of 20 is 16 amps. 12 gauge wire is the wire size. you do not want to put a miner on 30 amps unless you are planning on overclocking with a bigger power supply. or you have multiple miners on the same breaker. ( which is not recommended)

so if you are running say 4 miners on a single panel. each panel's main breaker should be a minimum of 100 amps because even though you theoretically outputting 80 amps on the breaker. continuous load is only 64 amps at 240v.",hv6mujt,si1pdw,/r/BitcoinMining/comments/si1pdw/need_opinions_on_wiring_for_a_asic_miner/hv6mujt/,5,BitcoinMining,2022-02-01 20:59:22

Now, the S19 XP isn't scheduled for release until later this year, and realistically given Bitmains delays maybe not even until early next year before supply trickles down to non-volume buyers.  

We can realistically expect BTC difficulty to rise maybe 50% in a year, so you'd be making roughly .0005 BTC or so.  If current prices stay the same, that's roughly $18/day.

If it was try to get the insurance company to pay. If they don't want to pay get a lawyer. I'm guessing nobody is going to pay for this unless it is through force of law.

bitcornminerguy,"FedEx is notorious for trying to deny claims quickly. I'd call back the claims department and ask them for their proper mailing address. Send them a letter via Certified Mail (return receipt requested) and demand that they pay the claim. State the reasons why you believe this damage occurred during shipping, and how this is a clear cut case of damage during transit. The shipper paid for insurance for a reason.

This letter will spook them, because its also the first required step for you to be able to file a lawsuit. They know this, and will generally start taking it more seriously when you send this. Don't skip the certified or return receipt part... VERY important.

Also, suggest you call Blok and urge them to call FedEx on your behalf. As the shipper, they paid for the insurance. If Blok calls them and states how well the box was packaged, FedEx will start to run out of ways to deny the claim.

Complete-Brick1720,"I would strongly suggest buying coins now. Whichever you choose, eth, btc or any other more volatile coin, the market is picking up, I'm sure it will go up within couple of months from now and you make more than waiting for your miner for 2 weeks and mining for few. 
Once your coin is high, you can buy more miners.

If there will be a case of you buying miners I would suggest goldshell boxes such as HS or mini doge or ST, they are the one to start, Ipollo G1 mini is also profitable, but I like goldshell more.

Be careful where you are buying from and how you are paying; most vendors will ask for crypto transfer, which is inconvenient and not safe. I bought (several times now) from asicminershub.com and paid PayPal with buyer protection. I highly recommend them if you are starting and don't know where to shop.

Of course, the best place is directly from manufacturers, such as goldshell, but unfortunately, they are always sold out, even if you get an email about restock, 5minutes later out of stock. If you manage to be the first one in line you have to have crypto ready in your wallet. Basically it was not good experience for me so I found these guys who I'm still in touch via WhatsApp if I need to ask anything. Outstanding customer service.

AndrewAwakened,"The thing to keep in mind is as the bitcoin difficulty increases, the M32S (the 66Ths model is the S) profitability will decrease at a faster rate than the S19J Pro, because the latter is more energy efficient. It’s using 10% less power to produce 34% more hashrate, and is currently producing $12.55 in profit per day vs the $4.18 of the M32S - that’s $8.37 more per day. 

If those figures were to stay the same (of course they won’t, but let’s pretend they will just to make it easier to think about) after 2.3 years the extra earnings from the S19J Pro will have made up for the initial purchase price difference, and it will have retained more of its profitability, as well as have a higher value at sell off when you upgrade to the new generation of miners.

So if you do have the $14K to buy the. S19J Pro, it might be the better buy.",hw0rm23,sn66o6,/r/BitcoinMining/comments/sn66o6/miner_selection_help/hw0rm23/,2,BitcoinMining,2022-02-08 01:05:13

Tourgasm,"So in order to do this you need a few things.

A router that can handle the bandwidth of 1500 miners

Network switches that can handle VLANs

Multiple VLANs that can handle multiple clients. 

A class A network ( class C can only handle 255 clients max and meant for regular households)

To get networks that can handle that you need to understand how subnet masks work 

Standard subnet mask  of 255.255.255.0 is your class C network which only handles 255 clients.

A subnet mask of 255.255.255.252 for example can handle 512 clients

RegularSufficient132,"ASIC miners now are overpriced, everyone in the mining industry knows that.

the reason is very simple, demand is high (big companies and individuals are ordering miners) and supply is low ( China is the one and only country that produces ASIC miners, the rest of the world just buying, only a few reliable manufacturers, and yet they delay shipping due to quote-unquote ""chip shortage"")

Fuck that BS....demand is high price raised, those manufacturers had us from our balls because there is no alternative or any other reliable competitor, ASIC miners prices reach a point for (Good-luck ROI) if you are not mining with cheap electricity or efficient cooling solution. 

let me put some simple numbers 

Price for Antminer S19 XP $11620

it can daily produce approximately 0.00067031 ₿ based on the current network difficulty and the hash rate of Antminer S19 XP which is 140TH/s.

 your daily production of BTC 0.00067031 ₿ \* 365 days (a year) = **0.24466315  ₿**

The price of BTC at this moment is $43400, that 

0.24466315  ₿ \* $43400 = $10618 **that's what you mined a whole year**

wait a second you didn't even return your investment, plus we didn't count the electricity bill, let's breakdown power consumption, shall we?

power consumption for Antminer S19 XP is 3050w = 3.05kw \*24 hours = 73.2kw per day \* 365 days (year) = 26718kw \* $0.08 price of average industrial electricity rate in Texas =$2137 

what you produce for a whole year $10618 - $2137 your yearly power consumption = $8481

the conclusion you need at least 15 months to get ROI if the price of BTC didn't drop and you didn't have to sell in your BTC to pay your electric bill.

take a consideration I didn't mention any other Opex like cooling 

till you get your ROI in the miner you'll see new series of miners double if not triple production and efficiency of your current miner. that based on fact just look at the biggest ASIC miner manufacturer (Bitmain) and look at the day of release of all ASIC series that produce

Oh, one more thing, the worst business move that anyone can do is pre-order and wait for a long ass time and they keep delaying shipping, look at people who pre-order Antminer L7 who promised to get their L7 miner in Nov 2021, till this moment are complaining about not receiving any!!.

sorry for my little rant here, I'm so pissed off on ASIC miners manufacturer, they tease you with a miner it has a high hash rate and low power consumption, you start planning your business based on that, you pre-order and freeze your hard earn money ""asset "" in their pocket and you hold the fuckin bag till they produce and every while comes with an apology about the delay or blaming chip shortage while they are shipping thousands of miners to big companies and you wait till the miner no longer that profitable like it used to be, than they ship it away.

RegularSufficient132,"I would say what you are looking for is something like [compassmining.io](https://compassmining.io) 

just for the record, I'm not associated with affiliates or marketing them.

the best play is buying a brand new miner, you can buy it from the manufacturer then you have to deal with them (shipping delay, and logistically till the hosting facility received it. it's a headache, time and nerve consuming .... trust me  

hosting in a mining facility have its pros and cons

you already highlighted your situation so the only way for you to get into mining is hosting somewhere.

here is a fact about power cost for most of the facilities in Russia 0.03 cents per kwh, yet you see hosting companies and facilities charge you 0.08 and 0.07 cents per kwh, you might have the electricity rate way higher than 0.08 cents per kwh and you should feel happy about the price but I feel cheated on or they think they are over-smart, some facility runs on hydropower energy, so it basically cost them nothing, just Opex (salaries for technicians). but again still way cheaper than your residential electricity rate wherever you are in the world. 

they won't take care of your assets as you do, don't be surprised or shocked if they hit you up after 5 or 6 months to tell you ( you miner is down got one board down, or it's not working need to send it to China to repair it which will take like forever plus the shipping cost for 13+kg miner is not cheap to china and back to the hosting facility, guess what! more often hosting facilities if they are (full crypto mining facility) they would offer you repair service, of course, you'll agree to that repair service saving all shipping costs!... silver line the miner is working with cheap power rate 24/7 and you have to watch it or monitor it at all  

ROI, let's see 

for brand new Antminer S19 XP, of course, if you are on the first batch you minimum of 13 to 15 months to get ROI point, that all depends on the miner's status (if it fully functions no errors) network difficulty, current BTC price. till you reach your ROI, there will be new series of miners and yours will be unprofitable due to high network difficulty unless the BTC is skyrocketing.

The bottom line is as much I love the crypto mining industry as much as I hate it now

check my POV on ASIC miners pricing and ROI

But it’s all speculative.  If you’re cashing out to fiat right away, then you have to use today’s price for mining.

JMMiningBitcoin,"You need a large intake vent, with enough airflow to feed the miners the air they need. If this isn’t a option, forcing air into the room is another solution. Same applies to the exhaust. 

If you are ducting, be sure to increase the size of the duct, not doing so will restrict the exhaust and affect hashboard temps negatively. We have a setup at 2x this scale. We have four 42” shop fans mounted exhausting.  The intake is partially filtered and fully screened, about 8’x8’. There is still suction(vacuum) on the door to the room. This tell me the miners are asking for more air. The intake will be increased to eliminate the pull on the door.

Edit: I forgot to address your ac scenario. Do not waste your money on an ac unit.

AndrewAwakened,"Well... the thing is, it’s all connected. Let’s say the price of BTC remains stuck around the $35K to $45K range it’s been in recently and the halving happens. Then yes, a bunch of less efficient miners will become unprofitable to operate. Then when their operators take them offline the network hashrate will decrease, and then difficulty will be adjusted down to compensate, making at least some of those miners profitable again, but many will never return to profitability unless the price of BTC really increases significantly, but then if that happens more and more people get into mining and the network hashrate starts going up again, and on and on it goes.

I think that going into mining means committing yourself to becoming part of a never ending arms race where you need to keep adding newer miners and phasing out old ones, or before too long you’ll find yourself with obsolete equipment you can’t even give away that you never got any ROI on.",hwajdni,soq1c4,/r/BitcoinMining/comments/soq1c4/bitcoin_halving_2024/hwajdni/,3,BitcoinMining,2022-02-09 23:14:54

What I’m going to do when/if I get my setup going is I’m going to take an old double pass radiator from my dirt car and use and inline pump and pump it right in front of the miners where the liquid would pass threw the miners to get to the spot where it will draw back into the radiator.

So price is a dynamic equilibrium between buying pressure and selling pressure. As mining adds new supply, about $45 million per day (I think), that means there has to be at least $45 million of new buys counteracting that. When issuance drops to only $22.5 million per day, will in effect be like adding an additional $22.5 million of buy pressure. So price would go up.

I can't remember where, but I saw a setup that had a hot and cold ""channel"" set up in such a way that the hot dielectric fluid rose to the top and spilled over into another compartment from which it was pumped directly through a radiator.

I think the heat transfer from the DF to the water through the pipes just isn't fast enough. 

Not an expert, but I do know that heat management is about getting the heat off quickly more than anything. Fewer 'moving' parts is probably better.

An S19 Pro (110th) brings about 0.00051817 btc/day or about 0.0155/month. Times that by 4 if you buy 4 rigs. And these models cost around 10-11k each depending on your supplier. Bitcoin mining difficulty is going up a lot and only getting harder and harder to be profitable. And profitability also depends on your current electricity rate and other factors as well.

Understand that some machines may never ROI unless they have no issues over the course of the next 3-4 years which is currently the predicted ROI timeline for the 110th machine.

caveatemptor25,"When making this assessment, or most investment decisions, consider the transaction from the other person's perspective. 

If you were an ASIC manufacturer/distributor, and you're selling a machine that ""prints money"", how much would you want to sell it for? I'm hoping that I become profitable in USD terms on my ASIC, however I'm unsure if I'll ever break even in terms of the BTC I paid for the machine.

I've only been privy to small-time mining for about six months...in this time, it seems to me that new machines sell (for USD) at about what you could plan to generate from them (in USD) over about 1.5-2 years, assuming cheap power.  There are sites you can check out that will show you current cost of production for different ASICs. The network currently pays about 20 cents/TH-day, and what your daily OPEX per TH-day will depend on your electricity rate. 

If you're not into bitcoin yet, I'd suggest buying and hodling for a year or so to get a hang of it and educate yourself.

Here is what I did. I built a room around a window in the basement ( it was all opened before)(5×10). I keep the window open and I installed a shelf in front of the window. At the opposite side of the room I installed 2 fans (1ft quare) and they push the hot air in my basement. In the winter like right now I heat my whole house with my ASICS.

This summer I will change my setup and install the fans to push the hot air directly outside.

I installed my fans with thermostat so for instance if I lose internet the fan will stop. And when it is very cold (-20) only one fan is running.

Keep in mind of the noise problem won't be easy to handle. My setup is installed in my cottage, during the summer I can hear the fans of the asics spinning even if I sound proof everything (I put rock wool and sonopan boards).

Anyway like I said it is doable, but it is won't be without any issues lol.

Subject_Technician89,"The speculative part here is the BTC and difficulty increase in the next few years. Neither move linearly, so if btc outpaces difficulty in the next 1 to 2 years, imo its absolutely worth mining with an S19. That's my issue with the Hopium calculator... it's a good baseline for averages and statistically that usually makes sense. But when you have periods of time where btc or difficulty moves off that ""average"", which is common given how volatile both are, it messes with the data. It also doesn't take into account the machines residual value.

For example, using an S19j Pro 104T 3068W for $11k, setting both diff and BTC to the 3yr averages of 4.2% and 7.1% respectively, with a 0.065kwh rate, it's a -8% return on investment by 2024 halving, compared to just buying.

But what if mining difficulty slows, and is only at the 1yr average of 1.8% monthly growth? Suddenly your ROI is 33.2% and you're break-even in 24 months, mining for free with a paid off machine after that.

Conversely, what if difficulty increases to the 5yr average of 7.2% monthly growth? -38.8% ROI, you should just buy coin.

See what i mean? While that calculator is decent, there are assumptions that it leaves out or can't fully consider, and part of your decision has to be made based on assumptions/variables. The halvings also tend to drive btc prices up historically, so there's also the consideration that machines can remain profitable after the halving.",hwiw03f,sq37nj,/r/BitcoinMining/comments/sq37nj/deleted_by_user/hwiw03f/,2,BitcoinMining,2022-02-11 16:49:51

ValuableShoulder5059,"""So the only cost you can control is power"" Nope. My utility sets the cost. But if I do use more power the cost does drop. Guess I need to scale up because I'm finally getting a couple kwh each month at 5.2 cents, so a new miner would run at 5.2 cents.

From what I found on the internet, the 10.3 has 4 hashboards with 4 connectors each. So you need 16 connectors for the hashboards and one additional for the control board.

You could either use one PSU with 17 connectors and at least 2640W power output, or 2 PSUs with 8/9 connectors and 1320W each. It's good practice to have the PSUs oversized by at least 10%.

CliffordTheDragon,"Put yourself in the shoes of a buyer. You just paid $1,000 for a brand new, unused miner (I'm assuming it's new). 

Why didn't you buy a used one instead, for the same price? Why would anyone buy a used version of anything for the same price as new? 

Miners have a relatively short lifespan. Maybe 3-5 years. You buy a new miner, you know you're somewhere in that range. You buy a used miner... Well now you have a lot of questions. How long has it been run, how hot was it run, was it well maintained, how much hashing does it really have left, and can I trust the seller to answer any of these questions honestly?

Why ask any of those questions, when you can avoid the whole ordeal and buy new.

So with that lies the loss of value. Like a car, the moment you turn it on, it's lost a good chunk of value. 

Now, unlike a car, that value for the used miner can go up if the price per terahash goes up, and BTC goes up.

1- the cheapest new ASIC miner price around $13k without shipping and taxes 

You need to take in consideration that you are risking a lot on the table for how much ? approximately 30$ per day mining BTC 
 You need at least one year and two months to start seeing some profit assuming that you got the miner at $13k and you didn’t pay any tariff or shipping 

ASIC miners made for industrial mining not home or shed mining. 

Loud and they produce a lot of heat, air cooling in dorm is pretty bad idea.

if you can stand heat and the noise in your dorm, I hate to break to you someone going to snitch you out cause they probably went nuts because of your free electricity vision. 

It’s not worth it to risk humiliation front of everybody when you get caught, plus the return of the investment is a way far, if it was 3 or 4 months ROI, I’ll tell you, go for it and risk it, worth the risk.

I mean the goal of having a miner is to print btc. If the price is going to 10k 100k 1M it will still produce the same amount of btc(not correct because the difficulty will change but you get the point).

AdMuch7162,"I bought cheap Igloo coolers for like $17/ea . quite large on the interior, which is needed as stacked fan miners are rather tall.

Used a jig saw to cut out 10"" circles on both ends where I fed thru 10"" flexible insulated ducting (with the insul peeled back) ; The 10"" duct goes around the double fans on both ends just right. No need to connect anything with shrouds - the ducting is tension fit within the cooler, and everything is sealed when the cooler lid is closed.  Acoustic difference is dramatic as long as you have decent lenghts of the ducting.Even with the lid open, the noise is greatly suppressed.

In my case the intake side is being ""fed"" with a 7"" fresh air duct from outside, and the exhaust side has about 10' of duct before the exhaust is utilized for heat.

side note:  I do have 3d printed double fan shrouds for other machines deployed without coolers -  i bought them on ebay, but they aren't cheap, and I wouldn't really recommend them unless you have a very specific need. The fact is, 2 - 5"" fans are too  much CFM for 6"" duct airflow, 7"" is too uncommon, and 8"" (which is what I have) poses other fit/size challenges - just not worth it.

Get the cooler, cut holes, use insulated duct. You'll thank me.",hwvj06o,sr1lyq,/r/BitcoinMining/comments/sr1lyq/cooler_noise_heat_insulation_dual_fan_to_6in_duct/hwvj06o/,1,BitcoinMining,2022-02-14 05:14:54

bryguy4436,"Network hashrate is a bitch.  I started mining in late June 2021 and I've seen more than a 40% reduction in BTC mined.

Personally I would not be buying anything at current profitablity and miner pricing.  We should be down in the $70 per TH range and yet we are still in the $high $80's to mid 90's.  

I personally mine Bitcoin and alt coins.  I mainly sell my alt coins to pay the bills.  I do buy more miners when I see a good opportunity though and I use my Bitcoin for that.  

What is your power cost?  That's going to be the biggest factor.

MicroBT units are by far the best quality new generation miners.  Bitmain is second.  Then way down the line come the other brands.  

Stay away for all bitmain 17 series miners.  They are junk",hx3yhx8,sthtia,/r/BitcoinMining/comments/sthtia/considering_jumping_in/hx3yhx8/,4,BitcoinMining,2022-02-16 00:34:32
Mystere_Miner,"No, you don't have to ""constantly"" be replacing miners.   Although you absolutely should consider rotating new equipment in periodically (once a year, every other year maybe).

I mean, if you bought 1 miner every 3 months over 5 years, you will have to be constantly replacing the oldest, but that's just because they're spaced out.

a current miner should last 3-5 years, still making a profit.  Though, of course that profit goes down slightly every 2 weeks as difficulty rises.

Antminer's are the industry standard.  With the exception of the 17 series, they have been almost universally well regarded for stability and reliability.  and when they do fail, there are numerous repair facilities all over the world.

Other miners, you may pay less for (sometimes) but their level of reliability may not be as well regarded.  And fixing them might be harder.",hx3yvyf,sthtia,/r/BitcoinMining/comments/sthtia/considering_jumping_in/hx3yvyf/,3,BitcoinMining,2022-02-16 00:37:25

Active-Indication-68,"I am currently engaged in the sales and repair service of mining machines, and my advice to my customers is not to think so much, if you believe in the value of bitcoin then mining is feasible, you just have to consider the electricity, heat and noise issues.

bcrawl91,"I have spent some time doing extensive research on feasibility of mining now and 'jumping in'. I have completed a financial model forecasting with sensitivity analysis, vs purchasing BTC alone.

My short answer to you is that it is profitable, but with a low likelihood and key variable of impact will be cost/kwh (I'm not just talking about your standard electricity rate but all opex costs broken down to a cost/kwh).

For my long answer I will break it down into 5 sections

Key variables of impact are:

\- difficulty;

\- opex, which you should try to break down into cost/kwh as it will make it easier to compare to the big players.

\- forecasted price of BTC; and

\- technology advancement (consider moore's law)

&amp;#x200B;

**Difficulty**

You will not find many forecast for end of 2022 that do not show between 300-350exahash. With that you could assume \~8% increase / month.

This has a considerable impact on profitability, and excluding other variables, you would probably want this to be &lt;5%/month. You can pretty much guarantee that margins will tighten dramatically and it will be a battle of the giants for who stays in the game.

**OPEX**

With overhead costs such as rent, electricity rates, cost of repairs etc, the big players are achieving \~4c/kwh by achieving economies of scale. If you compare that with a S19j pro 104t, thats \~$100USD/month if you were at 10c/kwh.

**BTC Price**

While price is a big factor in the equation, the higher it is forecasted the larger your potential profits with mining. This is very dependent on organisational strategy though i.e. do you constantly sell and reinvest in more capital, or hodl, or focus on capital investment in energy?

**Technology advancement**

Difference in miners improves year on year, 2020-2021 almost increased by 40% efficiency :O. Your typical lifespan for a miner should be assumed as 5 years where it can still be profitable (provided opex is low enough). However, a strategy that seems to work better on my forecasting is to sell after \~2 years to reinvest in latest equipment. Again more variables to consider, such as bear or bull market at time of sale.

**Other variables to consider**

Payback period - ideally you would want this &lt;1 year. Someone else wrote $/Th in a comment which is also good to consider.

Efficiency - goes hand in hand with payback. Clearly one of the fastest methods to make your equipment redundant when margins tighten.

Supplier competitiveness - Intel coming into the game should help drive prices lower for equipment. Although this is unlikely with chip shortage forecast heading into 2023

Halving period - early 2024. Your focus for getting into mining should always be out to the future and how you will still be in the game in 5 years. Halving will force a lot of acquisitions and make it tough for even the large companies. It will be incredibly difficult for small players to survive unless BTC sky rockets (which it should) but even then its difficult to justify getting into mining when the initial capital would have been better off in bitcoin.

\---------

Final note is that above is a lot of generalisation and getting into mining without large capital is an educational guess rather than an insightful business decision. I would say there is a far greater likelihood of making more profit purchasing BTC than mining it. If you are starting in it, to scale fast enough you would be looking at minimum $100k upfront. There is a great deal of difficulty in managing it at scale too which is another discussion.

I should also clarify that despite my above findings, I am a person who has 'jumped in'. I have made considerable money in other areas of my life and will be doing this for a hobby more than anything. I also have solid contacts I may be able to leverage to achieve better opex and remain profitable if I scale further. 

If you want more detail on anything let me know. I have tried to be brief so have skimmed over a few things. Hope it helps.",hx4i3r0,sthtia,/r/BitcoinMining/comments/sthtia/considering_jumping_in/hx4i3r0/,23,BitcoinMining,2022-02-16 03:01:25

Bitcoin miners are just not entry level. All of the questions are good questions, but are questions for much determined by your business plan once you have learned enough gather the information for these questions on your own. All very situational. Down to your geographic location.

That why i say entry level is video cards, they are flexible and you can put a good amount of $$ into a machine that will ROI in a year or so if the market does ok. You dont mine bitcoin with them, but it gets your feet wet and gives you a chance to mine different coins.

Bitcoin mining your not really going to find much that i would recommend you buy for under 10k. Yes there are plenty of options out there under that, but buyer beware buying used hardware. 

That being said, most asics are pretty much plug and play. Most come with an OS and most can be moved to another OS.

forget running the S19's near 47, no amount of air flow is gonna help you there.

I cannot understand the point of insulation; its counter productive. you need a sunshade and airflow to remove max amount of conductive solar heat.

what you should do is run 3rd party firmware to enable  you to \*underclock the ASIC's when heat is the most challenging, which I imagine is much of the summer daylight hours. Hopefuly you have some chilly desert nights that would allow you to overclock, and regain some of the lost hashpower.

Sometimes you have to tweek it multiple times and do a bunch of restarts. Try disable the preset and then set it to like 600 frequency on all and then turn the volt like 0.2-0.3 above defaults and save it. Let it run for a little then go back to the preset and choose the one you want. I think it takes the original settings and works around that for the presets. I had mine set super low by accident and I could not get the hashrate over 75 for a bit even with the 121TH preset.

Between 6-9 ct per kw/h is a good price i think. You should also consider that the difficulty will rise in the future. With these amount of asics your energy infrastructure should be rock solid, an employee would be nice for you. And you should secure the building with cams, fences etc..

-NewGuy,I see this question more as a question of what questions should I ask to determine what I should learn before I figure out if my idea is feasible. You should go watch some engineering content on YouTube. Permits and regulations are something you can look up with your local government. How do you effectively dissipate the heat from 250 miners? What are the tradeoffs between air cooling and liquid cooling? How often will parts fail and where do I find new parts? Is the plan to build a fixed location and bring infrastructure to your miners or build modular components that I can transport to the areas with the most competitive energy prices.

Purchasing 250ASICs you need at least 1MWh of power available depending the model you purchase, although I would be aiming for something bigger. There are plenty of rentable spaces with that capacity but if you purchase miners and sit back you will lose money. The key to profitability is through growth, outpacing the hashrate increase %. 

The larger your operation the more you benefit from economies of scale. However, with size it becomes more challenging. I would encourage you to research the hell out of it with that type of investment.

I provided some detailed feedback that I cannot be bothered rehashing, so it is in a comment on the post below. I would encourage you to have a read for consideration.

Soggy_Stargazer,"Amen.

You touch on tech, but also understand *WHERE* in the cycle you are entering.  Are you coming in early in the current generation of hardware or late in the current generation.  In the former situation, ~~your period to ROI should be longer~~ period of profitability after reaching ROI will likely be longer before your hash power is eclipsed by the next generation of ASICs.

The other point of consideration is how big your operation is.  Smaller operations may have better return if they dump the initial capex into just purchasing coins and holding and rolling monthly opex into a DCA monthly buy.

In my case, I mined for almost 3 years, hit my ROI (in BTC and fiat due to appreciation of mined BTC) but if I had simply held onto the BTC I invested in the hardware, and bought bitcoin with the roughly 400 a month I was spending on electricity, I would have ended up with more BTC.",hy5sswl,szrp6d,/r/BitcoinMining/comments/szrp6d/bitcoin_mining_vs_buying_bitcoin_the_truth/hy5sswl/,7,BitcoinMining,2022-02-23 22:30:48

LettersKenny,"You're missing basically everything but power. :)

The transformers, racks and electrical equipment, yes. But also: insurance, security, cooling (up to 1/3 of cost), network (also largest payroll line item), physical systems management, repair/rework stations w/certified techs. Storage space, freight receiving, etc.

That's before we get into zoning, utility costs (They don't run power to you for free, typically), lead times, and engineering costs. This all assumes a relatively ""small"" farm that pulls from ""local"" power companies. 100mW or more and you'll typically find yourself on a transmission package. This is federal (FERC and DERK). Lead times can be measured in years here. Seriously.

&amp;#x200B;

How you rate your rack space in terms of power and cooling capacity will determine unit cost. 

I'm walking this path now with our second location. The biggest challenge with pulling in machines of multiple models is that you'll need to design upfront for the changes in power/cooling/sizing needs. This affects everything down to wire and breaker sizing. 

It'll also require a knowledgeable staff capable of troubleshooting each system.

OldLatinGuy,"If you have any investing experience, the best way to think of hobby mining hardware is as a Foreign Currency bond. Crypto has all the risks of FX Bond investing with the additional risk of an effectively unregulated market. It has the advantage that any reasonably current mining hardware will retain a significant portion of it's purchase price, particularly of bought directly from the manufacturer.

All that said, because of the difficulty of mining BTC you're not going to see much return with any home capable miner. The FutureBit BTC miner yields about $0.40 a day at 200 W. before electricity for about a 16% annualized return. Other miners, (e.g. my GoldShell Mini DOGE returns around $0.90 a day at current prices for an annualized return of about 47%).

From a High Yield investor's POV, those yields are very, very good. 

If you have the funds available, for BTC look at the FutureBit BTC miner (which can be expanded with additional ""slave"" units and ships quickly in the USA. Otherwise the GoldShell products are ""reasonably"" priced and becoming more available from the manufacturer. 

One additional ""odd ball"" is the iPollo G1 Mini which mines GRIN at about $0.85 a day.

For instance, a few months ago we had regular 8% difficulty increases, although much of that was due to the artificial drop in difficulty caused by chinese miners going offline, then coming back online.

Another factor is that Bitmain has been moving their production from China to Malaysia, and has recently had a lot of production hit the streets.  So more miners are going online because more miners are being produced.

We can expect the difficulty to rise less over the next 1 or 2 adjustments because there were a lot of a miners in Ukraine, and many of those are now offline.  But the reality is that a lot of new, more powerful miners are coming down the pike this year... 140TH S19 XP's, 198TH Hydro miners, also the recent release of S19 series overclocking firmwares have probably not helped.",hyhvomt,t1oj2m,/r/BitcoinMining/comments/t1oj2m/sudden_increase_in_bitcoin_mining_difficulty/hyhvomt/,6,BitcoinMining,2022-02-26 09:17:07

JadeAug,"So Compass is just a middleman, they sell you a miner and find hosting for it, for a cut of the $/kWh you pay. The colocation facilities don't deal with the public, which is why they cant tell you where it is. 

I bought my miner through compass in June of last year for deployment in september. They claimed to have construction issues and had to relocate my miner to a different facility, and I wasnt hashing until late december. They ended up giving me a free year of hosting so I would say it was worth the wait. 

I still cant tell if compass is going to make it. They are spending too much money on shill marketing, and the money you pay for a miner today, is most likely paying for a miner they sold 4 months ago. There is definitely some default risk with compass, dont be surprised if they go bankrupt and it turns out your miner isnt really yours.

Diligent_Half_7777,"If people really understood it to me farming beats mining any day with the cost of investment vs risk vs the ROI. I personally mine BTC-ETH-KDA And STC. I've worked on passive income models and can definitely say from using Top GPUs (3080 - 3090) and a plethora of other hardware it's a numbers games the more you have to invest in more you'll make the shorter it will take for you to recoup on your investments however with the current volatility and the market gouging most resellers are selling equipment so marked up that it would take two years of mining to recoup the investment assuming that bitcoin stays between 38 and 45K. When the market is low it's almost better to just invest in coons directly or at least certain ones. If you were able to buy ASIC machine at MSRP then you will have a great experience. The caveat is Antiminer release their Hydro series which doubles the hash rate to 198 this means that professional mining farms will probably dump their old models upgrade to this model and even ASICS will be a flooded market. There's only 2 million bitcoins to mine and compete for over the next 140 years definitely things to consider. When big corporations can buy thousands of units and put them in a data center versus home users there's not gonna be a lot of competition in my opinion I feel this will drive a lot of hobby miners out.

mega__01,"Is there anyway the risk on ROI even starting up a decent-sized mining farm is significantly heightened due to major players gettin tons and tons more of capital investment than ever? 

With so many mining companies going public, they have access to capital markets that were previously unheard of in the space. I was reading that their cost/ bitcoin mined including all equipment was crazy low, at roughly ~ &lt; $6,000 ( iirc I was reading about Marathon). With Intel coming into the mining machine fray, would that ultimately push the price of machines down so that if you paid too high in the cycle for machines you would ultimately lose to someone coming in currently and purchasing a large amount of machines? There is no way Bitmain is seling ~ $100’s of millions of s19xj for what most people are paying? I would bet it would be almost half of the current “retail” market price, maybe a bit more.

As far as not disclosing specific locations - insurance has been nearly impossible to get for crypto-related businesses. So this could be a reason why? If you have a warehouse or facility with millions of dollars worth of uninsured equipment, you wouldn't want it public.

Yes, new hashpower coming online will always reduce your profitability, so its  a good idea to have a good effiency - depending on what you pay for power and what you pay for your ASICs you can calculate different scenarios based on different difficulty developments - that will give you a good idea what you should do - if you dont consider availabilty of miners and their price fluctuations.

AndrewAwakened,"Well, when you overclock you are operating the miner outside of the parameters that the manufacturer has determined to be acceptable. 

Now it could be that the manufacturer was not willing to invest the time and effort needed to fine tune as much as the third party developer did, or that the manufacturers engineers are not as skilled at it. But I don’t think that makes much sense - not only do the manufacturer’s engineers know the hardware as well as, if not better than anyone else, there is also a huge financial incentive for them to squeeze every drop of performance out of their machines so they can charge more for them.

So I must conclude that the reason they don’t push the performance as hard as the third party firmwares is that they have determined that it increases the risk of premature component failure. If that happens with the stock settings the manufacturer loses money as they would have to fix it under warranty. But if you use a third party firmware and it damages your machine, all the firmware vendor has to do is shrug and say sorry that happened to you - they have zero liability. 

So yeah, I’d have to assume there are going to be real risks if you overclock. Or course though lots of people accept the risk and do it anyway.",hz5df5m,t5izoh,/r/BitcoinMining/comments/t5izoh/overclocking_s19j_pro_with_braiins_os/hz5df5m/,2,BitcoinMining,2022-03-03 05:40:57

wattumofficial,"Buying a BTC miner provides you with more versatility from a long-term investment perspective while buying BTC gives you more flexibility. As of right now, an [**Antminer S19j Pro**](https://store.wattummanagement.com/product/antminer-s19j-pro-wi0084) costs a little less than $10,000 USD and mines at a hash rate of 96 Th/S with an energy consumption of 3250 W. Mining with this ASIC for a year would generate around 0.16 BTC in mining rewards. Given that Bitcoin is currently valued at $42,400, 0.16 BTC could be sold for roughly $6,784 if profits are realized at that price range. You will not be at positive ROI within a year, but you will still have the equipment, which may experience slight depreciation when more powerful miners come online if Bitcoin stays stagnant at around $40,000 USD. As [**ASICs**](https://store.wattummanagement.com/products/asic?csfilter=type@asic) are always in demand, you would be able to sell your equipment after a year of mining and be at profit. If Bitcoin spikes above its all time high of $60,000+ USD before the halving, then your equipment may even experience great appreciation with your mining asset increasing in value alongside your mined digital asset. Buying $10,000 USD worth of Bitcoin at the current price of $42,400 would allow you to acquire more Bitcoin in the short-term as you would be able to acquire \~0.236 BTC, but you will not be able to attain a consistent flow of income and price volatility may emotionally affect you more.

As of 2021, many mining companies have gone public and sold stocks to re-invest in mining equipment as holding Bitcoin does not generate profits on the balance sheets. During periods of big price spikes, the demand for [**ASICs**](https://store.wattummanagement.com/products/asic?csfilter=type@asic) are higher due to its short supply. Large public companies can take on more loans and issue more stock when they have [**a large array of ASICs**](https://store.wattummanagement.com/products/asic?csfilter=type@asic) on their balance sheet that can generate cash flow through producing digital assets. Holding Bitcoin can be collateralized to acquire loans in stable coins, but that would not be able to generate profits unless you use the loans to re-invest in more miners.

In 2017, the Antminer S9 costed $2,200 when Bitcoin still priced under $10,000 and was able to generate 0.50 of a whole bitcoin in just half a year of mining prior to the price explosion in late 2017 that spiked mining difficulty in 2018 as more miners came online. 0.50 BTC is currently worth $21,200 USD with BTC valued at $42,400. The Antminer S9 could have also been sold for as high as $8000 by the end of 2017. If you did not sell the Antminer S9 when it was the highest performing ASIC in 2017 and decided to mine at a loss during the bear market of 2018-2019, then you could have mined an additional half of Bitcoin, which is worth another $21,200 USD at today's BTC price. After the Bitcoin halving in 2020, the Antminer S9 was still in demand amongst miners who were able to procure low electricity costs as used Antminer S9 were going for around $1,100 per unit. That is a entire BTC mined with a 50% depreciation in 3 years of mining. Somewhere during that mining process, you could have sold enough Bitcoins to cover your equipment costs.

If you bought 0.50 with $2,200 when BTC was valued at $4,400 in 2017, you might have sold when Bitcoin exploded to $10,000 USD. Maybe you held all the way to its highs of $19,000 USD in late 2017 and then panic sold when it crashes back to $4,400 for no gain. Had you just invested in mining, you would not have experienced such as rollercoaster as you would have been focused more on your monthly returns and when to take profit in fiat rather than the fluctuations of a single asset.

As of 2022, the upfront costs of top tier mining equipment is higher but financing is now offered through some providers. Mining bitcoin with top tier equipment also takes more than a year to achieve positive ROI unless Bitcoin skyrockets above its all time high within a year. However, once you are able to payoff your equipment costs, you will essentially be mining for free minus the electricity costs. If you were hosting your miner with providers, you will also have a quick option to offload your miner and sell it back to your provider. If Bitcoin prices skyrocket faster than the increase in mining difficulty, mining companies will often offer to pay above markup to secure your used miners.

Depending on how invested you want to be with Bitcoin, buying and mining Bitcoin could both end up being profitable unless you buy high and sell low. When the cost to produce a Bitcoin is more expensive than the price of Bitcoin, then that is usually a good time to purchase Bitcoin as miners may perceive it as undervalued through mining economics.",hz8nwhw,t5pwi8,/r/BitcoinMining/comments/t5pwi8/newbie_here_please_explain/hz8nwhw/,6,BitcoinMining,2022-03-03 22:16:21

JPK_92,"TDLR: don’t use that circuit the way it is, either modify it or run a new circuit.

The reason why people use the 80% rule is because most circuit breakers are thermal-magnetic breakers. Without going too deep into it, what you need to keep in mind is that as circuit breakers warm up (due to the electrical current flowing through them) they will eventually trip. The closer the current is to the breaker full rating, the faster it will trip. Based on that you can technically have a circuit that pulls more than 80%, as long as the breaker have time to cool down. All this is to say that even if you are below the 80%, the fact that you’re very close to it, and because ASIC miners run 24/7, it’s very possible that breaker would trip after some time, because you’re not giving any time for the breaker to cool down.",hz8xg2y,t60qvm,/r/BitcoinMining/comments/t60qvm/30_amp_240volts_enough_for_2_s19j_96t/hz8xg2y/,2,BitcoinMining,2022-03-03 23:23:57

CrowGold3736,"According to the national electric code mining equipment is considered a continuous duty load because it operates for 3 hours or more.  Continuous duty loads require circuits to be sized at 125% of the the load. This includes the conductors/breakers/devices. 80% is the inverse of 125%.  There are such things as 100% rated breakers but you typically won't find them  untill you get up to 400a and up.

Now if your located in Europe their electrical code does not require the circuits being rated at 125% of load. 

Alot of big ASIC miners go with 415/240v 3 phase systems because of being more efficient as your line to neutral voltage is used to power the equipment. 

800a 208/120v 3phase = 230,297 watts
Vs
800a 415/240v 3 phase = 459,498 watts

And since 415/240 pdu's are EU they are rated to supply the full load 100%. Where as typical US voltage pdu's will be rated at 80% of the circuit they are intended to be  used on.

In this scenario I would design my branch circuits to be able to handle 60a continuous, so I would size the conductors at 125% and the breaker at 125% (75a).

   * Liquid cooling is having the water in piping that is plumbed into the system to cool it.  
Think liquid cooled computer with cool piping carrying liquid to each part.
* What would be the approximate costs of building liquid cooling system and immersion cooling system for around 30 ASICs?
   * Depends on which system and how you build it. You could literrally buy cooling solution, put it in a tub and drop the machine in. Or you can buy ASIC's made for liquid cooling and pipe the liquid everywhere.
* Should I try building it myself after doing proper research to save some bucks because the readymade systems are quite expensive from my aspect.

WhiteDogNC,"So sorry for the long, novel like answer.  I talk too much. 

Believe it or not, I’ve found really good deals on Amazon.  Iron Box brand has all sorts of lengths, colors, wire gauges, and input/output combinations.  

The one I got because of a PDU   

C14 to C13 Power Cord - Black, 15A/250V, 14/3 AWG, IEC 60320 - Iron Box Part # IBX-4903-06 https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0085CE9O8/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_glt_i_S8Z16WE5355MQY9FFR1K?_encoding=UTF8&amp;psc=1

But the 5-20P end is  

NEMA L5-20P to C13 Power Cord - 6 Foot, 15A/125V, 14/3 AWG - Iron Box Part # IBX-4931-06 https://www.amazon.com/dp/B004WJL9ZK/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_glt_i_VVBX48FX5SXADNGSJ0E1

But then you have to put multiple outlet boxes all over if you stick with L5-20; two per S19.  That gets pricey for power cables, wire, outlets, gang boxes, and installation.

Since I have L3s also, I use one L6-30 corded PDU and can put three L3 (660 watt x 3 = 1980) with one big machine pulling 3.5K watts.  As long as I don’t overclock and watch the heat making higher electric draw, I stay under 80% rule.  But just barely.  I have 10 gauge wire, short distance to the box, in steel conduit, and tight connections so I can surge here and there.  

If I wanted to run two 3.5 kW/h machines (two S19 or similar) then I’d go with a double pole 50 amp breaker, 6 gauge wire (close as HELL to the box - pricey wire), and one of those 50 amp octopus looking PDUs on eBay.  Then use four Iron Box cables.  It seems cheapest overall, and it’s scalable.  This is my plan for an L7 (if I ever get mine) with my lowest draw Whatsminer (with a Medusa knock off C20 to 2x C13 splitter) and an ETH rig or two L3.",hzez8sb,t6v3e5,/r/BitcoinMining/comments/t6v3e5/where_do_you_guys_buy_bulk_cables_and_which_cables/hzez8sb/,1,BitcoinMining,2022-03-05 04:57:27

sos755,"&gt; Is it profitable to mine Bitcoin in and of itself, or is it mostly dependent on the price of Bitcoin increasing? If the latter, why do people mine instead of just buying bitcoin?

People mine Bitcoin (or any other cryptocurrency) when the cost of mining it is lower than the cost of buying it.

&gt; Is it more profitable to mine for Bitcoin on your own or with a pool?

A pool generally charges a fee, so in the long run it is cheaper to mine solo. However, if you mine solo, it could be a year or more before you find a block and make any money.

&gt; And lastly, could I mine profitably with a 10k investment running the miners out of my residence?

Nobody can answer that question for you. Only you know your situation. Generally, profitability depends mostly on the cost of electricity and equipment. If you work for a company that mines, take a tour of the facilities. That will help you determine if you can mine at home. Probably not, as heat and noise are major problems.",hzncd9e,t8bkal,/r/BitcoinMining/comments/t8bkal/interested_in_mining_have_some_questions/hzncd9e/,2,BitcoinMining,2022-03-07 01:21:42

joe_cryptech,"1. Is it profitable to mine Bitcoin in and of itself, or is it mostly dependent on the price of Bitcoin increasing? If the latter, why do people mine instead of just buying bitcoin?

- personally the day to day profitability doesn’t matter to me as much as the number of bitcoin I’m mining. If the price drops 10k tomorrow or  climbs by 10k I’m still mining the same amount of bitcoin. Once you look further out the day to day volatility doesn’t matter as much, especially if you hold all the coin you mine. The reason I mine over buying coin is if I buy coin, that’s the amount I’ll have. If I mine coin, I should make back that same amount I would have bought, and then keep accumulating on top of that. 

2. Is it more profitable to mine for Bitcoin on your own or with a pool?

- you definitely cannot solo mine with a 10k investment. I mean technically you can but you may never find a block. Your best bet is with a pool. 

 3. And lastly, could I mine profitably with a 10k investment running the miners out of my residence?

- depends on your power cost, what machine you buy, etc. but you *should* be able to be profitable and ROI an s19 pro even on residential power rates, but that will depend on your rate.

When the price of Bitcoin gets back up closer to $50-$52k your math starts to turn upside down. Real miners who have been in the trenches awhile know that these down periods are coming, and prepare for them. You have to push through these less profitable times to make money in the more profitable times. It's a balancing game.

Prices were so good awhile back that even the old Antminer S7 units were profitable again... and while you can't expect something like THAT to be the case all the time... what it does mean is that guys with 17 series units and 19 series units were doing quite well for a bit there.

LettersKenny,"1 - Yes hardware is expensive.  I wouldn't enter into hardware until the price was \~$50/th or less.  But I'm VERY risk averse. 

2 - The machines can be thought of as a DCA strategy. All day, every day.  

3 - Less than 3 year ROI is actually fantastic. It's your expectations that are incorrect in this regard (though I secretly share them).

LettersKenny,"Depends a lot, man. You'd need to establish some of the big variables first. 

1 - Utility upgrade costs - How much will the utility charge to upgrade your service drop?  Each market is different in how the utility charges for this. In my market; we pay it all. So a mile of upgraded power line is roughly 300k for 15mw capacity. It goes up from there. Also of note; does their substation have capacity or do they need to add circuits? If so; you're paying way more with a long lead time (year or more). 

2 - Power distribution - Type and flow of power from transformers to miners. This a  very large variable. You can average 20-50k per mW installed on the low end. 

3 - You'll need to decide on the cooling process and it's requirements. Assuming a retrofit of the warehouse precludes passive thermal construction approach but if you're building new look into this. Otherwise free air cooling or conditioning. You'll probably end up with a water tower cooling loop at that size. The range on this will spread from 50-150k per mW, depending on many factors. 

4 - Engineering costs - average 15% of the project costs and you'll be ok.

5 - Associated - Construction, permits, grounds keeping, lights, security, shipping. receiving, offices, network. These will add up fast. 

&amp;#x200B;

Installed capacity, in my experience, will run 250-500k per mw. 

&amp;#x200B;

cookmanager,"You are spot on, unfortunately.  Mining currently is a loss-making enterprise when compared to simply buying bitcoin and holding it; equipment price is the main driver why.  When mining with $ return outlook, one has BTC exposure, hashrate change exposure and opex change exposure, essentially taking a bet on all three risks.  When mining with ₿ return outlook, you take the BTC price risk out of the mix (mostly.)  And if you are into bitcoin, why wouldn’t you have a BTC outlook?  :-)


I would not say it is a leverage play for bitcoin; you could simply buy bitcoin at the market instead of buying mining equipment, and you could borrow to do either route.  People often omit forecasted hashrate increases in their forecasts, too.  A big error.

Use 12 gauge min wire (12 ft ~$25).  Get a metal gang box, support bracket, and cover ($9).  Some conduit if you don’t want exposed wire; metal is not too pricey, the gray plastic stuff is fine ($20 - 35).  Get 2 conduit screw couplers, wall brackets, and some anti-static bushings ($6) ,make sure you match the knock outs in your gang box to the conduit size and the couplers.  Like open the packages in Lowes and play Lego’s.  If they fit together, buy them.  Then get two power cords ($18) that go C14 to 5-20 straight blade plugs, looks like a normal plug but one blade is up and down, one is sideways, one is the round one at the bottom.

If you wanted to be REALLY sure you could cut a wire and check the gauge.  

But I’d bet a dime to a dollar that A9 will fluctuate on electric draw and each 6pin will be pulling 125 watts at random intervals; it’s not 100 watts per connection all the time, every time.

lexicalsatire,"Excellent. Thanks for echoing what we've posted. Educating new buyers is definitely important, and there is a steep learning curve given the surge of scams this week.

For new buyers, your first step when talking with any seller/ vendor should really be this:

• Ask to jump on a phone call with the seller - this is to check they **even exist.**

• But what is even better is to **jump on a video call** \- you can see how they look, whether they look shady. First impressions matter - your instincts will guide you.

• Ask if local pickup/ meetup is possible - you can visit their store or office and see if they are legit.

• Ask for their business address and business registration/ incorporation - go search their address on Google maps. Is their address in the middle of nowhere?

The great thing about the above is it's free to do, doesn't take much time. Lastly, there is no **obligation** or **risk** of you losing money at this stage.

Remember, any **legit** business should be able to accommodate these simple requests. Deflecting questions, phone calls, video calls, meetups (where possible) are all signs that you should look elsewhere.

bt-miners,"Reddit has a great Crypto Mining community. There are many legitimate sellers but, like every other platform, there are those looking to take advantage.

For Vendors you can check r/LegitASIC to see if others have purchased from them. There are many scam websites out there. So why not read if other Reddit users have experience purchasing through a particular vendor before taking the risk. BT-Miners thanks our customers who nominated us to that list and shared their positive purchasing experiences. 

Many good tips have already been mentioned. See what payment options they accept. For example, BT-Miners accepts credit cards to give customers flexibility and protection. PayPal, as mentioned, also offers consumer protection. If dealing with an individual, there are third-party escrow services available that will hold the money until the transaction is complete. A scammer won't be willing to use any payment option that offers you a way to get your money back.

When it comes to used mining equipment, we've been scammed before and received unrepairable junk. If you aren't willing to take the risk, look for a trusted vendor with used equipment. BT-Miners tests all used miners before we ship and also offer a warranty. If there is a problem, we work to correct or replace/ refund.

Even if you bring your electricity costs down to $0.15 kw/h it might still be better to find a host in US or Canada where you can find hosts as low $0.069 kw/h

The Antminer L7s are expensive at around $25k a unit. However the ROI is amongst the best on market you should easily return over $1k a month after electricity costs. 

For a bitcoin miner the S19 series ($9 - 13k) is the best . For a cheaper brand but with similar spec check they cheetah miner  F9 or koi miner c16 series. I think both units are around $6-7k

cynicalyak,"First, what is the cost of electricity per kwh? This should be the first factor when buying an ASIC. Honestly if your paying more that .09c per kwh, it might be more profitable to just by and hodl coins.

Second, what is your price range? ASIC mining is essential a nuclear arms race where you should be buying the most powerful/profitable machine, which are usually the most expensive. Examples include the L7, KD5, or S19 XP. 

And last, what coin are you looking to mine?, Or does it even matter to you? 

One site that is helpful is www.asicminervalue.com

How many are you looking to buy, as buying bulk usually gives you a bit of a discount. I can recommend you sellers that can sell you 1 or ones that can sell you 100.

If you want to go back to Bitmain stock then you need to download [BOS Toolbox](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1GoBApm8kIwwFHvxqwlZeOwWcj3kWILA3) and follow their instructions, it's actually easier than I thought and reverts it right back to the Bitmain stock firmware.

Download the BOS Toolbox from the Braiins (link is for Windows version but there's a Linux one as well) [website](https://braiins.com/os/plus/download).  
Once you've downloaded the BOS Toolbox, open your command-line interpreter (e.g. CMD for Windows, Terminal for Ubuntu, etc.)  
Replace the FILE\_PATH\_TO\_BOS\_TOOLBOX placeholder in the command below with the actual file path where you saved the BOS Toolbox. Then switch to that file path by running the command:  
cd FILE\_PATH\_TO\_BOS\_TOOLBOX  
Now replace the IP\_ADDRESS placeholder with your miner's IP address (or host name) in the command below and run the appropriate command for your operating system:  
For Windows command terminal:

Redsoxfan0825,"I have an interesting question for the group. Has anyone considered installing an AC unit in the area with their miners to keep the ambient temperature around 60-70 F constantly including in the summer? I have an S19J Pro with an inline 8” fan blowing through the miner and exhausting outside. The temperature in the garage is essentially ambient so there’s no issue removing the heat, however, in the summer it will be significantly hotter in the garage. I’ve seen the dramatic efficiency decrease of the S19J Pro vs chip temperature and was curious if it’d be worth maintaining ambient around 70 F to maintain this efficiency vs letting it get hot in the summer. It’s a finished garage/gym, so an AC would be nice to have anyway, but I’d be curious how often it should be run.

Verakari,"Electricity agreements are always negotiated before construction begins. This is important because this is a key part of your profitability and can mean the difference between a profitable operation and a non-profitable operation.

&amp;#x200B;

An electricity broker is a good route to go if you are just starting out. They lend credibility to your operation since they can leverage existing relationships. Usually if you are new to a city, most utilities are not willing to work with you because:

1. They don't understand crypto and are worried that if they sign a long term PPA with you and you go out of business, they're stuck holding the bag
2. They have to invest a lot of capital into making sure the grid is stable to deliver energy to you. Usually they have to do a load study and make sure that the existing lines and transformers can handle the increased load. Load studies can take 3-6 months and costs around 10k to do.

However, brokers are not free. They generally upcharge your electricity rate which will cut into profitability. 

If you want to go to the utility yourself, my suggestion is to ask the utility for energy is smaller increments \[around 3 MWs or so\]. Anything higher will invite skepticism and stall out the process. Most utilities our group has talked to flat out think it is impossible for a customer to use more than 5 MW and they aren't even willing to talk about anything larger than that.

To answer your questions specifically:

**Are large mining farms classified by the utility company as commercial or industrial?**

They are almost always industrial.

**Are they already generating 10MW of power while paying $0.09/kWh for example, and they then go to the power company requesting a lower rate?**

No, there is usually a ramp up process where you commit to a certain consumption by a specific time. If you're able to hit those numbers, they will give you the lower rate right off the bat.

**Do they go to the power company 'before' setting up anything and say, ""look we're going to be using 10MW, what's the best rate you can offer us?""**

Right, you need to work out an expansion plan with the utility. You can ask for their rate schedule and figure out what energy breaks there are based on the load.",i0yfcoe,tfupp3,/r/BitcoinMining/comments/tfupp3/how_do_large_mining_farms_figure_out_electricity/i0yfcoe/,9,BitcoinMining,2022-03-17 00:18:59

LettersKenny,"This thread has the most educational answers I've seen in some time. Well done lads!

&amp;#x200B;

I'll also add some complexity to the mix - Each energy market is a little different. What works with ERCOT wont work well up here. Upfront you can ask your utility rep (we work with the economic development teams) to provide a billing simulation. It'll break down a year's run by month. 

Energy rates are always ""locked in"" first. It's a back-and-forth dance that takes months, as stated before. The utility has many stakeholders. It takes forever to navigate them and finalize who has to pay for what. This is a big part of why larger farms (30+mW) can take 12-18 months to bring online.

OMGLIFEomglife,"I haven't heard of 21mining but I know compass, blockware solutions, sanzmining, mining syndicate, and verakari. I recently learned that many of these hosting companies are resellers which is why they are either sold out all the time or have reliability issues or have delays getting miners up and hosted. Out of the companies I mentioned I think the only one that actually builds hosting space is verakari. The rest resell hosting space. In terms of experience I've had a great overall experience with mining syndicate and verakari. The rest I've had a decent experience. There are others out there but I would avoid. Don't know 21 mining, maybe they are ok, but I can tell you some horror stories. The main thing I would look for is the quality of the facilities they plan to host the machines inside. Some of these places can be a makeshift space which really shortens the life of the mining servers. I've learned the hard way that the facility and facility maintenance is just as important. Dust, issues with managing temperature, using flammable products like wood, or building a mining operation out of those old rusty shipping containers just doesn't work. Machines will fail and your several thousand dollar investment will be at risk. Take a look at companies like RIOT Blockchain, they have the pressure of investors, meaning they are trying to ROI as fast as possible by spending as little as possible. If the facility didn't matter, they would be using the makeshift hosting setups all day because it's super cheap to build, but if you look at their stuff they are actually building high quality data centers that are very expensive. These mining machines are not cheap and like any computer, need a good, high quality environment to operate and last. I've gotten machines back with rust on them from humidity, dust caked on, or dealt with repair issues months after buying new machines. Generally you get what you pay for and for what it's worth, I would rather pay for a quality facility even if the hosting cost is higher because I know my machines are being cared for so that I can ROI. I recently pulled my miners over to mining syndicate, verakari, and blockware solutions. Verakari has some videos of their facility and they look like RIOTs so you know they are legit. Mining syndicate has great customer support, but as I said I believe they are a reseller, but they expressed to me that they are willing to share photos/video of the facilities they place machines in because they care about the facilities as well and are not just trying to place machines anywhere. Plus if you think about costs, depending on the miner, 6.5 cents is only $50 - $70 cheaper per month when compared to these other companies, so it doesn't impact how fast you ROI all that much when you are spending several thousands of dollars per machine. I treat the additional premium like insurance because I can rest easy knowing the machines are going to be taken care of so they last long enough to actually ROI and not be down for maintenance or whatever other issues. Anyway I hope that helps, happy to share my experiences more anytime.",i19ehhy,thfbd2,/r/BitcoinMining/comments/thfbd2/anyone_ever_use_21mining_for_mining_hosting/i19ehhy/,6,BitcoinMining,2022-03-19 08:49:46
OMGLIFEomglife,"Never heard of them but checking out their website, it doesn't look like they have any facilities up and running. That's super important to me. I have no idea how to run a data center but that's exactly why you pay a hosting provider. So putting these machines that you've invested several thousand dollars, in some makeshift space or with a company that has no experience running a datacenter operation seems very risky to me. In my experience, if you get the machines back from the hosting provider and they look like garbage, then they are a bad hosting provider. The only way to tell if your going to get back a good miner or garbage is by looking at their facility and facility maintenance. I would stick with the proven providers out there or at least look into providers that are being transparent and posting pictures and videos of their facilities. You wouldn't pay me to host your machines in my basement or my backyard shed, but if you look at some of these operations it's not much better in my opinion.

Yes, the biggest miners in Texas use them. 

They become less effective as the relative humidity increases. 

Water can only evaporate from a surface if it condenses first. Thermodynamics tells us that as the temperature of the air increases; so does the capacity to carry water (humidity). As such, the air moving through the units (cooling the unit and heating the air) increases the carrying capacity, negating the risk of condensation.

CryptoDPi,"With that kind of investment, you'll most likely be looking at using a hosting facility, unless you have some a space already setup for the electrical requirements. 

I'd suggest you take some time to learn and make connections in the mining world before jumping in. If you reach out to companies like Blockware Solutions and Frontier Mining to get started. They are both hosting companies but each has a different feel, imo. Last I checked it is very difficult to find hosting when you're bringing your own equipment. The hosting facility wants you to buy equipment through them.  Another concern I have about owning and hosting equipment is the lack of insurance on the equipment. There is a new insurance company called Bitsure that will be launching anytime. They'll plan to offer insurance on your equipment.  I'm not recommending these companies, I just think it's a good place to start. 

Another option is Supplybit, instead of buying equipment, you purchase a mining contract for a specific amount of Terahash. The advantages are lower entry cost, guaranteed BTC payout, and the pool fee is 0.8%. The downside is the monthly management fee, which is reduced with larger contracts. Even, great people to talk to and learn from.

Sadly, everyone wants to get into mining right now. You can expect a delay of up to 6 months from when you sign up to when you go online if you're using a Colo or a contract based system.",i1gfykg,titgcy,/r/BitcoinMining/comments/titgcy/startup_mining/i1gfykg/,2,BitcoinMining,2022-03-20 22:00:22

Mining facility: mining seacans are the cheapest options for mining, they are easily portable for moving sites if need to. 

Internet providers: try to find something that can work for the location that you are looking to start mining in.

Router: easiest to setup are ubiquiti edge routers

Network switches: you will want something with 48 ports, Cisco switches are dirt cheap on the marketplaces

NonceAlot,"I have been running a small mining operation since 2017. I started with GPU's but quickly moved on to mostly ASIC's and it has been a wild ride. I have made a ton of mistakes, but have enjoyed the entire ride. There is a lot to consider and I have stayed on the less than 50 miner ASIC path which allowed me to contain and manage this from a location I already had. This greatly simplified the cost structure, and I have a decent power cost (.08). I just had to figure out the business and accounting side of things that I have done, and I can turn a decent profit and have minimal overhead. I recently went through a build-a-mine Bootcamp with Brad James and Scott Offord which will give you a comprehensive picture of what it takes to do what you are asking (https://www.eventbrite.com/o/scotts-crypto-mining-5985955415). They do a great job of framing it and you get to work with a variety of people. The bottom line is you should sign up for this and go through one. It is so worth the money (it was $100), that I wish these existed when I started. Even if you are going to keep it small this will be very helpful, and it will give you a framework for what it takes to scale it if you want. It is a fun industry to be part of, but it has quite a few complexities, especially on the infrastructure side. Fortunately, I have a technical background in IT, which greatly helped in several areas of this, but I had to dig deeper into the power and HVAC side. I am now looking at immersion mining which is requiring more research and knowledge.

They will replace the fuse and when it blows again a week later after you add the rest of your 127A back online, they'll replace it again and probably call you. Since transformers are $sky high right now (if even available), they will tell you that if you blow the fuse again, you'll be charged for a new transformer (aprox $18K). When you ask about an upgraded transformer (50kva), they'll also price that out for you and it will be cost prohibitive (if even available).

AdMuch7162,"Buy BTC / HODL and do nothing else.You have no ""Free energy"", no more than anyone else on the planet.

20k sf of roof isn't anything at all.  It's no different than 20k sf of ground (which I , and many others have, roof or otherwise).  Your ""place"" really has no value at all, relative to ASIC mining.

Let me ask you this - will your solar panels be free? will the installation and electrical connection of them be free?

If not, then you need to budget realistically; you do not say where this property is, but lets say that its in sunniest place on the planet: Yuma, Arizona. Or, runner-up, Aswan Egypt.  Both have minimal cloud cover and precipitation. Still, you can only count on an average of 12 hours of sunshine/day over the year, and of course, your panels will not provide full efficiency without mechanical sun tracking.

Go find out what 20k sf / 1859 m^(2) of high efficiency solar panels cost. Again, I don't know where you are, but unless you are getting this for free, you are at looking at an enormous cost for that quantity of panels... panels which will only support a handful of modern ASIC miners (for half a day).

I see below that say you can get grid power for 5-7cents/kwh.  Let me assure you that you cannot deploy solar power for less or even close.  Solar power only makes economic sense for locations where taxation or commercial factors make electricity expensive, even if your rates are ""off peak"" (which will be well less than 12 hours/day).

Immersion is quieter, but probably not a great solution for an apartment. The other issue is if you have 220v outlet already as the majority of Bitcoin miners won't run on 110v. Your better bet right now would be finding a hosting company (unless you have access to another space). There are many out there and do your homework. Besides the obvious electrical cost factor, you should ask if there is a minimum units required, are there maintenance fees/ repair options, where located (even if they don't provide an exact physical address for security reasons), how soon can they start, setup fees, cost of the ASIC or can you provide your own, etc.

slykens1,"Let us assume for a moment that the house you are in has 200 amp service, that you can continuously consume 80% of that for mining (nearly no other loads in the house), and that you can modify the electrical panel as needed. 

Based on the above assumptions, you have 38 kW of power available for mining. That’s twelve 3.2 kW miners (like an S19 or L7) or maybe twenty-five plus S9 or L3 depending on how you clock them. The S19s would earn about $7,300 a month, the S9s would earn about $2,300. The S19s will cost you about $100,000 while the S9s will be about $7,000 or so. 

I do not know what your arrangement for electricity is - if you draw 38 kW continuously, that will average just under 28,000 kWh per month. In my area not only would the combined power and distribution charge be over $3,000 per month, you would also be subject to an additional demand charge for using more than 10,000 kWh per month.

The modern bitcoin ASCICs consume so much power, that you need free *commercial* electricity (like 400amp+ service) to really make a dent.

If you are in a normal residence, there is a chance you'd want to pull so much power that you might need to upgrade the service panel to like 400amp - which means $10k install and getting power company out.

If you are in an older house with a 120amp service or even 200, I would stretch to think the utility company/whoever IS paying the bill wouldn't suddenly notice the equivalent of multi 2-ton AC units running non-stop now.

Also you need like $12-15k/each laying around to pickup miners that are going to do anything interesting in that time frame... and you'd want a few of then, maybe 5 (over 3 years)...

The noise and exhaust heat were just shy of unbearable. I built an enclosure out of 3/8” plywood and project foam from Lowe’s.

The exhaust was directed through an 8” ducting flange that was coupled to 8” insulated flexible duct.

Also I've heard, to delay your ability to make a claim, they send a package but then change the shipping address after printing a label so it winds up somewhere else and they can claim they sent it and it shows received, countering your claim that you've been scammed and never got it.

bt-miners,"It is no different than what is already happening in Texas. There have been a couple ways of using excess energy. The first is flare gas that would normally be wasted - burnt off or vented. So being able to utilize this gas is reducing emissions while providing a useful purpose. 

The second is using mining to utilize excess energy in non-peak periods. It is very difficult to constantly increase or decrease electricity production based on demand in real-time. By nature, an utility provider has to produce more than what demand calls for otherwise you get blackouts. Miners can utilize the excess electricity when available and then phase out as demand increases. You will see more and more energy providers integrate mining operations because it adds profitability. 

Even if you are doing renewable energy such as solar or wind, crypto mining could be more profitable to use the excess energy produced rather than to sell to the utility company for cheap.",i2he2z5,tq55jn,/r/BitcoinMining/comments/tq55jn/exxon_mobil_is_about_to_get_involved_in_bitcoin/i2he2z5/,1,BitcoinMining,2022-03-28 20:37:49

delmarvablockchain,"What really matters most in this case is the gauge of the wire… is it 12/2 or 12/3? Are you sure both outlets are on separate breakers? If both outlets are the same breaker, it’s cleaner and safer but the outlet should really be rated for 20a and the wire should really be 12/2 or 12/3 (absolutely not 14/2 or 14/3), and the circuit absolutely must be dedicated to the one miner and only the one miner. A 15a breaker on this setup should be sufficient and safe, but often a 15a will trip on single phase when hashing. 20a double pole breaker thru the dedicated #12 wire to the dedicated 20a outlet, with 2 c13s feeding your rig… this is safest and most reliable for at home. Not an electrician, but I paid electrical engineers and learned from them.

I don't know how you're planning on running yours but I have a 5 1/2 Year road map where I sell absolutely nothing.

Fearless-Trash-7888,"I've avoided doing this because I don't know how psus are wired inside. Bitmain support didn't really answer the question about phase matching when asked multiple times on their support site.

120/240 panels, 2 different 2 pole circuits could be either use the same phasing or the exact opposite, ie XY or YX.
Pop goes something, maybe.

120/208 panels have the same issue only now there's 6 phasing combos, XY, YX, YZ, ZY, XZ, ZX. If the 2 circuits don't match, poof goes the miner?

240/415 panels have 3 phases to neutral, so 3 different combos assuming hot legs are wired consistently, Xn, Yn, Zn.

If you can verify phasing indeed matches at the outlets, and one of the circuits trips, what will happen to miner on only 1 circuit? Will it trip the other circuit immediately, will it still run hot or poorly, or just stop? I wouldn't risk it, personally. 

TL;DR
Bitmain psus might blow up if power phases to both plugs don't match.
Phase matched plugs on different breakers might cause miner damage if 1 of 2 circuits trip.

WhiteDogNC,"I think the most important part here is that these miners are designed to run on 240V at a minimum; look up double sine wave electricity.  This is what a double pole breaker does, it hits two hots that run at different timing.  Three phase is all 120’ apart with three waves.  

You can not run these machines long term on single pole breakers.  Try and run anything designed for 110/120 on a 240V line… it dies.  

Easiest way is a double pole 20amp breaker per machine.  Use a commercial grade outlet with two 6-20P straight blade.  No PDU.  Two power cords.

You’ll have the 80% safety all the way down the line and no inspector will red tag you.  

But keep your options open with a few 30amp double breakers for PDUs.  You never know what you’ll be mining with and one big machine with a few little ones is very nice to have on one breaker.",i2urfgg,tss32o,/r/BitcoinMining/comments/tss32o/can_i_use_2_different_breakersoutlets_for_1_s19j/i2urfgg/,1,BitcoinMining,2022-03-31 14:53:32

Hammereditor,"It might actually be a better idea to sell your coins, then use that to reinvest in new hardware. With Section 179, you can write off the entire cost of the ASICs in 1 year. Since you're the one buying the equipment, you should have no problem doing that. You still pay zero in the end, just like if you HODL'd the coins. This is a good idea if you want more and more equipment as fast as possible.

Based on advice from my accountant, file it as an LLC but elect Subchapter S treatment during tax season. As long as you pay yourself a reasonable salary based on the amount of labor you actually spend, you'll avoid the 15.3% FICA tax.

If you sell coins without rolling the cash into new equipment, you'll pay ordinary income tax without the FICA. Likewise, if you sell the equipment, that will be treated as income without FICA.

My strategy is to do the above, and on top of that, pay the power bill with my own cash instead of selling the coins.

red5couch,"I fully understand my impact. I have built and are operating a 1mw solar asset spread over a ecovillage that has 500kwh battery. I lead the engineering team. Its a zero carbon power system that huge excess power. It is also a demonstration of how to build zero carbon suburbs. I know exactly what I'm talking about. 

I get this often that using energy is bad. This is completely incorrect. The carbon content of our power system as a whole is what is bad and that my life is committed to changing. 

The economics exist right now in many places that can prove that POW can buy energy that would be wasted. Here is an example. In NSW AUSTRALIA there is 5 solarfarms(big ones) that MUST shut down when the wholesale price go below zero. This happens almost every day in spring and autumn. Many megawatts of solar turning of daily. Its called curtailment and it damages the economics of solarfarming to the point that noone is building more here for the last year or 2. So now there can be a BTC mine in a container at the solarfarm. As soon as the price drops to say 3c they start diverting the power into the miners. They make money and so does the solarfarm. Now the next solar farm can include this income in the financial modeling and then they can be built. 

Same with wind farms. If the wind blow in the middle of the night when there isn't load it all now gets pumped into miners. More load for windfarms = more profit for windfarms = more windfarms. 

So this whole post is based on energy use is bad. Its false. Coal power is bad. Renewables are good and POW is a great companion to be a dispatchable load that can support a lot more renewables 

I have just bought 1 x S19 but this is R&amp;D to scale to many more in my grid and ensure its 100% renewable. I know it's possible I am now proving it to the rest of the engineering team. With evidence as we are currently exporting 1000kwh per day. And im adding more solar every week.

bt-miners,"&gt;How does one cope with stress while the drops in price occur. 

1 BTC = 1 BTC. Many that are mining aren't concerned with the day to day fluctuations in the marketplace. If you believe in Bitcoin (or other cryptocurrencies) then the reward is going to be long-term. This isn't a ""get rich quick"" scheme. For years when Bitcoin was worth almost nothing, mining was done at a loss. However, those that had the foresight to start mining when it was 50 BTC per block, would have made out tremendously (if they held).

 

&gt;How does one come up with the capital necessary to purchase miners. 

There isn't an easy answer to this one as it depends on your goals and resources. Are you talking home miners or large institutional operations? Obviously public companies use investment to raise capital for equipment. For many of our home miners, they start small and then grow. Some choose to re-invest mining profits into purchasing equipment and others purchase equipment with other income stream/ savings to increase scale. At BT-Miners we offer credit card payments as an option and are currently looking at other financing options to help miner purchases.",i3cyz20,tvosf8,/r/BitcoinMining/comments/tvosf8/mining_hobbyist/i3cyz20/,1,BitcoinMining,2022-04-04 15:03:48

I suggest buying from stores like Bitcoin merch, or Newegg. Those are the two I’ve bought from. Newegg I like most. They’re almost like Amazon but for computer parts. If something screws up or you get screwed you can always return it for your money back.

LettersKenny,"Lots of options. 21 mining is a good one.  I have capacity available behind a primary meter. You could start building tomorrow if you have the equipment ready.

&amp;#x200B;

Capacity is a running gun battle. If upstream materials were available more capacity would be coming online quickly. Right now ASIC manufacturers are outpacing transformer/infrastructure material suppliers. Call any top 5 supplier and ask what the current lead times are. Up to a year is become normal.

Without a significant change to the supply line scenario lead times are going to continue increasing in the near term. This, I feel, is a certainty. Prices are similarly increasing to reflect this and the refurbished sector is almost bone dry.

It's worth noting; the amount of power needed - 10mW - is not something any company I'm aware of will build out ""just incase"". It's a massive amount of power.

This is a very large contract, it would perhaps be worth noting that scale and appreciate the ask for what it is. If it could be done faster people would do it. It's not laziness you're running in to.

I've tried to manage this expectation with many would-be-farmers. The lead times are shocking. Yes. But they're only going to get worse in the short-term. Fast forward a few months and your concern may shift from ""can I shave a few weeks off"" to ""did I just lock in a multiyear contract with the wrong guy"".

ValuableShoulder5059,I would say the biggest pro other then the taxes could be in helping to stabilize grid demand if the local municipality is involved with electric supply. Someone somewhere has to start very expensive generators when electric load gets high. In fact the electric load must exactly match generated load. With a mining farm they can put a huge load demand  on the grid utilizing the excess capacity. However this load needs removed during peak times and especially during super peak time. If a host is willing to shut down the miners during this time it is extremely beneficial to the local and state grid.,i3jajs7,tx3c70,/r/BitcoinMining/comments/tx3c70/mining_interactions_with_local_governments/i3jajs7/,1,BitcoinMining,2022-04-05 20:19:25

I reached out to the mayor of a sleepy town in rural KY where I’m building a 0.5 MW facility. (0.5MW is small potatoes, but represents a gigantic personal investment on my side).

I do not expect to pay property taxes on the mining rigs, and I probably would not locate anywhere that imposes such a tax.

I bought the building where I am setting up, so I expect to run equipment for as long as the electric rates allow me to remain profitable. The local electricity company has asked me to pay upfront costs to bring the 0.5MW to my building because they think Bitcoin is a fad.

  240v with a power factor of 1 the miner would draw 13.5 amps

Calm_Satisfaction836,"Bitcool works great and as they state it is designed for asic electronics. There are others out there but I'd suggest staying with a tried and true. The fluid will need to be pumped... generally around 1gpm. you'll need to reject the heat through a radiator with a fan on it for cooling. You'll need to read up on the fluid as you can just use any material for plumbing and gaskets.. I have a 50kw system at home that we use for R&amp;D which uses bitcool and it works well. I'm leaving a ton of little things out because it can be a little different depending on how you design the system. If you are investing in this setup it may just be cheaper to send the rig off to be hosted if the.primary reason is noise and heat as you'll probably get a better kWh rate too but I also understand the fun factor part.

DeFiAntUnderMiner,"The most obvious difference between Binance and Slushpool has already been pointed out, namely the difference in payout methods, Binance will no doubt pay more consistently on a day to day basis, whereas Slushpool will tend to fluctuate more based on luck.

However, my decision wouldn't be based upon the payout method but rather the hardware I was using... 

Slushpool's custom firmware for some Bitmain ASICs, which tend to increase performance by 20% and/or increase efficiency. I would personally recommend Braiins OS over the default Bitmain firmware, having used it myself. Basically you pay a dev fee for the firmware, however you get reimbursed for pool fees when using Slushpool. So using Slushpool makes sense to me when utilising Braiins OS.

My favourite feature of Binance is being able to accumulate daily interest on mining rewards. This is a great feature compared to Slushpool and other pools where to the contrary minimum payout thresholds and/or network fees apply. Another advantage to Binance is having mining revenue easily accessible to trade (whether this be to fiat, other coins or withdrawn to decentralised platforms such as Binance Smart Chain).

Personally, I utilise both pools and have had a good user experience with both.",i40b3x1,sslwnf,/r/BitcoinMining/comments/sslwnf/slushpool_or_binance/i40b3x1/,1,BitcoinMining,2022-04-09 07:28:35
DeFiAntUnderMiner,"I've been mining bitcoin for around 6 years now. I do have a background in IT however Indont have a degree.

I'm not making enough money for it to constitute a full-time income however the mining income plus capital gains that I've made have improved my quality of life and increased my net worth.

Overall, it's been a very rewarding experience.

Bitcoin mining has become increasingly competitive. In order to give yourself a competitive edge, location is an important consideration. In my view, location factors are as follows (not in a particular order);

1. Climate (the cooler the better)
2. Electricity price (the cheaper the better)
3. Geopolitical factors (regulation, legalisation and taxation of crypto)
4. Access to infrastructure (namely electricity)

My advice to someone starting out mining would be to learn what you can from others (there's heaps of information online), then invest in some cheap hardware (even if it's not profitable) in order to learn the fundamentals and gain some first-hand experience. 

After gaining some experience then you'll be in a better position to make a decision regarding larger scale operations.",i40f81s,tz740y,/r/BitcoinMining/comments/tz740y/hey_friends_so_i_figured_out_what_i_want_to_do/i40f81s/,2,BitcoinMining,2022-04-09 08:22:03

Openminer,"I purchased 12 L3s at the time 12,000 some were good some crap.  Of course they had video ""proof"" of them working but I still managed to turn a profit.  Not much but something.  Crap happens in business.  L7s came out blowing up the hash rate and without cheap electric these things are just space heaters.
I reckon I'll double my money on used miners but one L7 would have blown it them out of the water.  I have some better returns on some other investments.  
The borrowing money I would do if the rate was correct.  I can't get my wife in board so I'm investing on some other things that are more hands on but pay more.
Just being honest though we're in the water with some pretty big fish right now.  They are exploring waste gas as a free energy source.  I don't have 400K to grab any land with those resources plus building an infrastructure to safely store miners plus the miners necessary to get the money back 😂
My .11 cents rate which is super high for crypto went to .17 because they figured I need it bad so they can charge more.  Those S.O.B's wouldn't give me a quote for commercial rate, excuse me the ""didn't know"" how much it'd be.  Which translates to ""oh it's going to be high.  We're just embarrassed to tell you how high""
Your electric needs to be less than .08 cents.  It's adds up fast, real real fast.  Good luck.  Buy new machines if you can.  Cheap electric, study electric installation.

jonathansnbr,"I have 7 machines with them bought them in late Oct got them going in Nov. they were prompt and great then. Then Chris tweeted out their business and it blew up. Next thing for some reason they sponsored Voskcoin without having hosting for a mass influx of mining orders. These past 3 months have been the product of mass expansion during a period of limited hosting space available. Now they are scrambling for space be it in Idaho or PA but the pressure from us has been heard and felt by the MiningSyndicate team. My business partner has had a ton of issues getting his Nov preorder for L7s going and just this past week has gotten them online. Me and him just ordered 14x whatsminers in total from them and have faith they will get us fixed up. Y’all have to understand MiningSyndicate didn’t exist 5 months ago, and yes they could of handle all of this better but you have to understand that they really are the only ones offering what they are offering. 

My business partner didn’t choice compass  even though they have a discount on equipment and electricity but expected start up was in Aug and would tie up capital for far to long. Even if we don’t get our new machines on for 2 months you can’t make back those lost BTC and the cost difference fast enough especially if hashrate increases by then and that’s not accounting for any compass delays themselves.

Corporate mining is hard and consumers of a new business owner have to deal with the growing pains. It’s harder for us all because of how expensive this business actually is.

The reason for the rating at 20A is that you can’t load a circuit beyond 80% so 20A circuit really equals 16A usable.

silverwilliam,"if you get 12 months warranty you should be glad, in practice if you are a 'professional user' you will never get 24 months, only 12 months. Furthermore, while the legal guarantee is valid for a period of two years throughout the EU, but there are certain conditions:  
The legal guarantee covers any defects presumed to have existed at the time of delivery and which become apparent within a period of two years. However, the crucial period is the 6 months after you bought your product:  
Any fault that appears within 6 months will be presumed to have existed at the time of delivery. The seller must then repair or replace your miner free of charge, or reimburse you if repair or replacement is impossible.  
After 6 months, you can still hold the seller responsible for any defects up to the end of the two-year guarantee period. However, the seller can ask you to prove that the defect existed when your goods were delivered. This is often difficult, and you will may have to involve a technical expert.

If you run the miner in bad conditions for example too hot or too moist, then your warranty will be void.",i49ekda,u0us1c,/r/BitcoinMining/comments/u0us1c/any_reliable_asic_seller_in_the_eu/i49ekda/,2,BitcoinMining,2022-04-11 05:55:21

mark2685,"I use compass and I think (as another comment mentioned) that the negative reviews are due to peoples patience level. There have been delays with miners coming online, but they’ve been pretty transparent about the situation, at least in my eyes. Also keep in mind that people are far more likely to complain about something than to praise it, which is why you hear more negative comments than positive ones. 

They do not own or operate the facilities, they’re simply facilitating you purchasing a miner, and hosting it at a designated place for a set fee under a 12 month contract. These facilities are often very new, or are still being built, so there are unknowns that come up that are simply out of Compass’ control. In my case, the facility I was supposed to go to had major issues, so they re-routed my miners to another facility that was still being completed. There was a few weeks delay while some work was being completed, and some delays due to inspectors needing to sign off on various things. But I’m finally up and running. 

If you go with them, treat their “estimated online date” as a very optimistic estimation, and expect about a 1-2 month delay. They’ve been pretty quick in responding to tickets, and have given me some credits to try and offset the delays I’ve encountered. It’s not perfect, but they’ve been pretty transparent and fair and seem to be listening to the community and trying to improve.",i4bswb4,u0y52q,/r/BitcoinMining/comments/u0y52q/for_hosted_miners_is_there_any_company_thats/i4bswb4/,2,BitcoinMining,2022-04-11 18:54:46

AndrewAwakened,"My approach would be to use a good profitability calculator to work out the difference in earnings. If the extra earnings from that 6 Th/s can be reasonably expected to ROI the extra cost well within a year then yeah, might as well go for it if you can squeeze the extra cost into your budget. 

The longer the ROI stretches the more I would tend toward don’t bother, just keep the extra money in your account and put it towards your next miner purchase.

Edit: Just want to add - there is an opportunity cost to not buying more hashrate, because minimum rewards tend to decrease over time as most difficulty adjustments are upward, and there is a halving coming up in 2024. So if your strategy is to stack BTC in expectation of its value increasing over time then buying all the hashrate you can afford right now makes sense. However if you are more concerned about the passive income you can earn from mining right now, it might make more sense to be more concerned about the short term ROI.",i4fc7dm,u1yqyu,/r/BitcoinMining/comments/u1yqyu/differences_between_the_104th_110th_s19j_models/i4fc7dm/,3,BitcoinMining,2022-04-12 13:31:21

UnderprivilegedSky,"On the Apollo BTC miner you will get 3Th at 200 watts. You can over clock them up to 3.8 at around 300 watts but the more your over clock the less efficient they get. 

  
Each terahash should generate around $.16 per day of BTC for $.48, assuming 3Th. With an electric rate of .16 times 4.8Kw, you would use $.76 of electricity a day for a net loss of $.28.   
The Apollo BTC miner is a great little box, but you're not going to break even with such a high electricity cost unless the price of BTC takes off. 

  
The Apollo BTC is great if you're looking for a fun little miner to mess around with. As a business venture, not so much.

My unprofessional opinion is all ( j ) units are the same with different firmware from the factory. Any J unit is more efficient but the S19 (non-j) 95th units can be over clocked to push out 120-140th around 3700-3850 watts. Being they are a cheaper model now, I’d run them full tilt boogie.

levicam,"Most of the noise comes from the fact that the fans run at extremely high RPM's, which can be solved in a few ways. First is to download custom firmware that allows you to underclock/undervolt the units which runs them cooler, then you can manually set the fans to a lower speed. That is a super simple fix that will probably solve 80% or more of your issue. The second is to add venting to the exhaust to create negative pressure and draw more air through your units, this can be done with duct shrouds on the units and an inline duct fan. I recently did this to an L7 as a testbed and it quieted it down so much I don't need any sound dampening (the L7 is more of a screamer than even the S19.)

[https://asicbasics.com/cooling-and-quieting-down-an-l7-s19/](https://asicbasics.com/cooling-and-quieting-down-an-l7-s19/)

When you vent the units outside make sure to take into account the amount of air you moving out so you can have enough fresh air coming in. Otherwise, in hotter months, you'll be sucking out all that great AC air which you don't necessarily need, and running your AC non-stop. I have my units using ambient air and fresh air from outdoors. Even when it's in the 90's the outside air keeps the units cool enough with the airflow I have going.

I also did a project to quiet down units on the cheap with coolers if you want to go that route as well (super cheap and very effective):

We specialize in GPU &amp; ASIC mining we believe you are a lot better off buying a ASIC miner due to the most profitable coin to mine with GPU's is Ethereum. Ethereum is projected to switch to a proof of stake network which means you will not be able to mine Eth anymore. Im sure there will be other profitable projects to mine with GPU's but if your looking to get a machine that is significantly more profitable shoot me a message and I’d be glad to help!,i4o65ne,u3b0j2,/r/BitcoinMining/comments/u3b0j2/asic_or_gpu_for_small_rig/i4o65ne/,1,BitcoinMining,2022-04-14 06:49:24

AndrewAwakened,"For a miner that old, maybe one can expect it could have 2 more years of reliable life in it, so if someone is feeling lucky maybe they would be willing to have it ROI in a year and then the second year until it is expected to die would be the profit, and then anything further than that would be an unexpected blessing from God and shouldn’t be factored into the calculations.

According to asicminervalue.com at 5 cents per kWH the monthly profit would be $139.06, and at 0.10 cents it would be $53.38. There’s still 2 years before the halving, so we don’t need to factor that in, so let’s just think about the difficulty. 

Using an average difficult increase of 5% per month, over the space of 2 years the estimated profit per month declines from $139.06 down to $42.68 at 5 cents electricity rate, or from $53.38 down to $16.34 at 10 cents electricity rate. 

That gives a total 2 year profit range of $1968.12 to $755.03 depending on electricity rate and assuming 2 years trouble free operation. 
The first year electricity rate dependent profit range would be $1278.03 to 490.48, and as I said above that’s what the price of the miner should be based on.

One last thing to consider - it’s almost impossible nowadays to find third party hosting for miners that old, so it’s not like someone operating in an area with higher electricity rates can buy it and then easily host it somewhere else where they can take advantage of the lower rates, and the majority of the US has the higher rates, so your pricing should probably be weighted more towards the $490 number rather than the $1278.

Taking all that into account, maybe someone buying 10 to 50 gets them for $500, 5 to 10 gets them for $750, 1 to 5 for around $1000? I think that’s a fair place to start, and then people can try to haggle a bit based on their individual circumstances and how long it’s taking you to get them sold.",i4pc05p,u36v5e,/r/BitcoinMining/comments/u36v5e/avalon_1047_pricing/i4pc05p/,2,BitcoinMining,2022-04-14 14:20:19

If you pool your machines together into a group of workers, you will get quicker payouts, minimising costs.

JeffreyDollarz,"Depends on a lot.

I like negative pressure. Real easy to setup some box filters so the air being sucked into the miner enclosure is well filtered and then the miners are sitting in an enclosure that can be sound deadened and/or insulated. Exhaust noise would be the next battle, which the s19s are not too bad with, imo. Much quiter than some other miners...

Positive pressure means blowing in already filtered air.

Depending on the amount of miners and ducting, might be easier to keep up with a negative pressure rather than a positive. Remember, positive means you always have more air dumping into the enclosure than the miners are spitting out of the enclosure. Can you reliably do that when their fans are running full speed?

The miners themselves can create the negative backpressure in your enclosure. Have them pull air from inside enclosure and spit right out the enclosure. Seal enclosure up well and then add space with box filters to suck clean air in. Pretty basic setup.

I am talking an enclosure, inside a room (where the air in the enclosure will be pulled from), with the exhaust being spit outside of both the enclosure and the room the enclosure is in(typically this would be ducted to outside).",i4vlkm6,u4bm5q,/r/BitcoinMining/comments/u4bm5q/to_suck_or_to_blow_that_is_the_question/i4vlkm6/,1,BitcoinMining,2022-04-15 20:44:10

underworld_doom,"When you submit a hash in Bitcoin, Litecoin, or similar proof of work, it's scored for how much work statistically would be needed to find that hash. That is the ""difficulty"" of the hash.

Your miner gets the parameters from the pool on how to construct the next block's header, and a space to search. This is all in hexadecimal so we use numbers to better express it.  Your miner gets the previous block ID, then an area to search, say all numbers 0-10 billion, and a letter in from of that, A-Z. So your miner takes a a hash of the previous block hash, appends A-0, hashes that, and sees if it matches the pattern for a valid hash. If it doesn't, it'll do A-1, A-2, A-10B, B-1, B-2, etc. (Again, this is a text explanation of what's happening in hexadecimal.)

Eventually, after searching, it'll find either a hash that matches the pattern (starting with a 0 for example) and submit that. The pool then can look at that result and know it would statistically take X amount of hashes to get that result.

So every valid pattern you submit is a share - a hash that meets the basic pattern. In general, the number of shares increases, the more likely you are statistically to find a block. For Bitcoin today, that's 28,225,928,151,211 valid shares until you find a block.

Now the value of the share you find is random - you know the statistical distribution but from hash to hash it changes. Your best share is the highest share that work has submitted in that session. The best ever is the highest diff share that worker has ever submitted. If the share value/difficulty is higher than the network difficulty, you get a block when solo mining.

In pooled mining, you are paid out based on your shares when anyone finds a block, and remember on average it takes trillions of hashes to find a block. You will likely never find one, but you could get 2 or 7 or 10 in that many tries. It's all random.

While it is extremely unlikely to hit a block, CK's pool is good, but Kano's pool (the K in CK pool) is a lower fee for solo mining.",i4zagz5,u4e977,/r/BitcoinMining/comments/u4e977/solo_mining_questions_solo_ckpool/i4zagz5/,1,BitcoinMining,2022-04-16 17:24:29

information-zone,"Think of Bitcoin mining as a business rather than an investment.

If you’re looking to add £ to your bank account, you’ll be better off buying BTC than buying mining hardware.

The truth is:
You’ll spend all 10k and it will take 18 - 24 months before you’ve earned 10k worth of BTC and that is assuming BTC price remains constant &amp; your electricity prices are low &amp; you can maintain the hardware running 24/7/365.

But, if you really want to start in this business you should buy an ASIC or two. If your space is limited, You’ll probably want to look at “S19 Pro” machines. If you have unlimited space &amp; electric outlets, you might do better by buying “S9” machines.

The decision will also need to factor in your electricity costs. High electric rates should push you toward “S19 Pro” machines.

Or maybe you’re hoping to give your £ to someone and have them do it all for you. If you go this route, know your payback period may be even longer. The company will sell you the rig at an inflated price and will charge you more for electricity.  But at least you won’t have to deal with the heat, noise, and maintenance.

Edwin_4SpaceMining,Typically when a customer calls (I Co-own 4Space Mining) and want to know for information about mining Bitcoin the first question I ask is what’s the cost of your power. I believe when mining Bitcoin that’s the most important factor across the board. The ideal range would be to get your price per Kwh in the 2-7 cent range to mine it profitability and 7 cents is on the high end. The second thing would be to find equipment at a good price. Attending crypto conferences as well will give you the ability to find good equipment suppliers to make sure you aren’t making crazy marked up prices.

1.  With your power estimates, you’ll pay about $0.40 (or your currency equivalent) per day maximum on each miner, so yeah, I would scoop up a crap ton of old S9s for next to nothing.  

2.  Power outages will destroy you.  Abrupt shut downs with no way to cool these things will cook your miners in less than one week in Africa; unless you’re way south by S Africa, and even then…

3.  The noise is never ending and you’re doomed.  You can block a lot of sound, but eventually the hot air has to get outside and it’s still loud.  Especially with a 300 unit farm.  And padding is just more insulation to cook your box, so bigger fans, and more noise. 

4.  No.  Buy extra and Frankenstein them together as hashboards go out.  Just replace the whole miner eventually.  S9s cost less to buy than repair.

bbalazs721,"Regular breakers have two, special ones have three reasons to break:

1. Instantaneous current is very high, this happens at actual short circuit, when two wires touch. The breaker pops immediately and can be flipped back right after it.

2. The long term current is exceeding the rating of the breaker. This happens when there is a bit more current flowing than what the breaker is rated for. This is supposed to prevent the downstream wires melting and starting fires. It only does that if the wires are rated for the same or higher current than the breaker. The reason fires occur is beacuse of the bad quality wires or connections. When the breaker pops like this, usually they can't be flipped right away.

3. When current ""leaks"". The special breaker will flip when the live current does not match the neutral. The current can leak through a human or any other way to ground. This does not cause fires.

So im confused if in the end, did you get the s9i working properly with just 1 fan or did it only work after you got the second fan?  Cause i saw someone on here post that the firmware detects if you only have one fan and prevent the s9i from working properly.",i5xz4tw,sbp7hc,/r/BitcoinMining/comments/sbp7hc/can_an_antminer_s9_work_with_only_1_fan/i5xz4tw/,1,BitcoinMining,2022-04-24 00:42:24

akadam_,"No idea about the legal side of this, so I will not comment on that.

From the hardware perspective: there are nowadays small miners using a few hundreds of watts, thus generating not a lot of heat (always better letting the hot air out somewhat anyways), producing barely noticeable noise but it varies from unit to unit a bit, ATM machines have access to the web so that's figured out.

Here are a few examples, none of them mines bitcoin actually, mining bitcoin for profit would need much more power hungry equipment, ""income"" is at today's market prices and before power of course:

\- Goldshell LB-BOX (175Gh/s on Lbry algo @ 162W, around 0.65USD income a day)

\- Goldshell CK-BOX (1.05Th/s on Eaglesong algo @ 215W, around 1.01USD income a day )

\- iPollo G1 Mini (1.2GPS on Cuckatoo32 @ 120W, around 0.74USD income a day)

\- Goldshell Mini-DOGE Pro (205Mh/s on Scrypt @ 220W, around 1.10USD income a day)

\- Jasminer X4 BRICK (65Mh/s on EtHash @ 30w, around 2.58USD income a day, that is hashing Ethereum which goes POS in a few month)

So yeah, such machines you describe exist, feel free to do your own research, these 5 are available on the market at this time, maybe order a sample to have your own idea on noise and heat.

2- their people were actively working through the weekend to provide these. I know many people found them in their dashboard. It takes a long time to provide that many serial numbers. Granted we should have had them a long time ago...

3- once again they're working on this. They've said they'll provide it.  

4- repeat?

5- if it's cloud mine then how have I sold more than a dozen miners with them? I had all the serial numbers for all them too.

6- it's been less than a week. While it would be nice to have the refund already, it takes time

7- see above


 Definitely not going to tell anyone to host with them ever again and I've sold all my other miners with them.  I just don't agree with all of your critiques.

If a certain miner looks more profitable, it is because it is a riskier investment then another. The L7 has been quite profitable recently.

coop87122,"The simple answer is the numbers have to make sense for your situation. 
Here's the TLDR :-D
You have to decide level of investment for solar. If you want to run at night you either need a net metering system and generate 2x the kwhr during the day so it balances, or a battery back up (batteries tend to be expensive for these types of loads where you need continously power so lots of stored energy).
Grid tie with no battery, you need around 15-20 of the 250watt panels (about 4kw) to have free mining during the day. Shut miner off during the night for no night time power draw. You'll only be mining half time but with almost no consumed power.
You still have the cost of installing solar. If you're paying $.10 per kwhr, running a S19-95t is about 3.3kwhr. Or $3.30/day if you run it 10 hours a day. The s19-95t is about $6k used though, (so 6x the mining speed at 2.5x the power draw)
Profits all depend on when you sell, what you think BTC will be worth, how difficulty mining changes.
But a year of being diligent with 10 hours a day, with good sun every day, will 'save' you $1,200 per year in electrical costs. 
If you mine .0003 x 10/24 (for the fraction of the day your mining) BTC per day with the s19, your mining $5/ day at a $40k btc. If btc goes to $300k and you sell, you will effectively be mining $37/day at all the same numbers.
With electricity covered
$5/day = $1,825 per year 
$37/day = $13,500 per year",i6j5a5d,ud5u1k,/r/BitcoinMining/comments/ud5u1k/is_it_possible_to_power_an_asic_miner_using_a/i6j5a5d/,3,BitcoinMining,2022-04-28 13:33:10

AndrewAwakened,"Wrong sub dude. 

In any case, no, it’s not that easy. Difficulty will progressively increase so rewards will decrease. Plus there is a difficulty bomb scheduled in June which will make proof of work mining completely unprofitable. Plus even if those things didn’t matter or happen, the memory of this miner is already almost maxed out by the eth dag file size.

Basically, if you buy this miner you will not make back the amount of money you spend on it by mining ethereum - there isn’t enough time. However, it can also mine other coins. They won’t be as profitable as Ethereum though, and they will be even less profitable once Ethereum can no longer be mined and much of the hardware that was pointed at Eth gets repointed towards them.

I’m not saying this miner will never make you money, but in order to work out if it likely will you need to do a good amount of research and then make a judgement call.",i6s4rib,uf3e3t,/r/BitcoinMining/comments/uf3e3t/is_it_that_easy/i6s4rib/,3,BitcoinMining,2022-04-30 12:02:54

ZealousidealCall4856,So I don't know if you want my thoughts but bitcoin mining has always been profitable if you keep at it. the price will fix its self as people realize the coin is worth more because more work is going into it for less coin. Bitcoin has always had its ups and downs and some times it is not profitable because of the difficulty but as long as you stick with it you will make some money. also having cheep electric really helps because more can go into mining. Also if you want my 2 cents i get my miners from [www.advancedmining.io/910561](https://www.advancedmining.io/910561) they also host my miners for much less then i can at my house.

donmulatito,"all other factors being equal, yes when the halving happens the same hash-power will yield 1/2 the amount of BTC.  But the global hash power(difficulty) will likely be much higher by then, so profitability from the same machine will likely fall significantly even before the halving takes place.  But the BTC price will also likely be much higher.. so then it also becomes a question are you concerned about breaking even on USD terms or on BTC terms?  breaking even on BTC terms is more difficult if you think the BTC price will increase significantly (which likely causes an increase in hash power, which in turn makes your machine less profitable.)

but in any case its pretty hard to guess at the break even point, because we can only speculate on what the difficulty and BTC price will be in 2 years.",i6si4ds,ufb10t,/r/BitcoinMining/comments/ufb10t/bitcoin_halving_2024_impact_on_hosted_mining/i6si4ds/,3,BitcoinMining,2022-04-30 14:10:05

ZealousidealCall4856,"So for me I would go with the miners. I get them from [www.advancedmining.io/910561](https://www.advancedmining.io/910561) and i can get 3 of them for around 26,143 plus the 775 shipping fee (or you can have them host them and they  have way cheaper eclectic cost)

Now as it comes for why i go for the miners is because of ROI. for the 1 coin you could make an extra profit or lose profit in the 2 years. Also you have to think what do you think the price of the coin will be in 2 years lets say 60k for the average. so that is a 20k profit (and not bad) but once it is sold you make no more money   


As for the miners right now you would be making about 17k  per year with 3 miners(spending only 23k). 7 k for electric and that leaves you with 10k profit the first year. so in 2 years you would have 20k in profit (assuming no difficulty change). so you would make the same money and basically pay the miners off in the 2 years and have 3 more years to get profit from the miners or until they break or get sold. so i would say an easy 15k more. 

&amp;#x200B;

So in the long term I would say you would make more money off of mining then holding bitcoin and hopping it goes up in price enough to make it worth selling. but hey i am not giving finical advise and at the end of the day its your money to do with what you want lol.",i6skd9d,ufb4x7,/r/BitcoinMining/comments/ufb4x7/logic_question_buy_1_btc_vs_3x_s19s_halving/i6skd9d/,-2,BitcoinMining,2022-04-30 14:28:30

ZealousidealCall4856,"I mean you can do that but if Ethereum goes to POS then you have to switch to another coin that won't be as profitable. Also, you have to worry about noise, heat, and if your house or business can handle the electrical load 24/7.

- are you holding the btc until a perceived "" top"" and then selling for fiat?  
- are you holding btc u til you die? In this case, ""profit"" will be difficult since you spent your apples to buy orange trees.

levicam,"Welcome to the club! If I could offer one piece of advice, think about future possible additions. If you do a 30A circuit you won’t be able to run a second S19 on that. If you do a 20A circuit you can safely run one per circuit. Basically not wasting $ on more expensive material for unused capacity. Then again if you plan on putting other miners on there of lower wattage then it can work. I wrote an article about planning circuits that may help.

LettersKenny,"You're conflating large capital projects with speculative investments. 

&amp;#x200B;

The concept lost in popular discussions is that crypto IS a speculative investment. If you're crunching numbers and comparing them relative to non-speculative assets; you've approached it wrong. This is not, should not be, and cannot be thought of as an income replacement for salaried workers. That's literally not how this class of investments work. 

&amp;#x200B;

This means: 

\- You're not really supposed to be in deep enough that you need the cashflow generated from the machine to maintain it's upkeep. We enforce this clause in our contracts to prevent future defaults.

\- You're buying in bulk, and your Th/$ average is lower than you seem to think it is. You're definitely correct that timing your purchase matters. ATH is a bad entry point. 

\- You speculate that the price will increase appreciably, and because of 1 and 2 above, you're able to hodl until your off ramp approaches by the numbers. If it doesn't, you're well off enough to survive. 

&amp;#x200B;

I hate to say this is a game for the well heeled, but; speculative classes are always easier to participate in that way. 

&amp;#x200B;

In regards to big money adoption driving difficulty rates; yes. 

This participation will likely do 2 things: push the market out of a speculative class and lower the expected returns. It's been screamed from the mountain tops here on reddit that ROI under 3 years was basically an auto-win for commercial entities.

The HVAC fan pushes so much air that the only noise is the whistling noise you are talking about. The noise actually gets louder if you take the grate off.

sogladatwork,"&gt;Is 40 to 65k enough to get a good farm started (?)  

No. If you're looking for legitimate passive income, you're going to need to start with at least $100k. Buying 6-7 S19XPs with that money would be the way to go. But even then, you're huffing a lot of hopium that the price appreciates before the halvening (if mining Bitcoin - and why wouldn't you? Altcoin market heading towards 0).

But let's say you do start with 65k. If you're lucky, you buy up 8-9 S19J Pro 100THs with that cash. You still need to buy racks and outfit your space with the electrical requirements. What's your local cost of a KwH? $.1? 

These rigs will each mine you about $15 worth of bitcoin each day, but the electricity cost will be around $7 per day at that rate. So you're looking at $8 a day profit from each machine. Is that enough passive income for you?  

Of course, the difficulty is always being adjusted, so you're going to constantly need to increase your hashrate to go along with the difficulty to maintain that income level.",i78ssl9,uhwfda,/r/BitcoinMining/comments/uhwfda/im_interested_in_starting_mining/i78ssl9/,1,BitcoinMining,2022-05-04 02:42:09

4SpaceMining,"It depends on what your definition of a “good passive yield” is and how cheap your electric is. With 62k you can get about 7 S19j’s 104 TH/s and use the rest to outfit your electrical system. You also want to account for the noise and heat the miners produce. They get very loud and heat up any poorly ventilated space fast. If you plan on hodling the Bitcoin, which is the way to go with mining, then it is the safest long term coin to mine. Don’t listen to people who are saying you are late to mining. Yes the difficulty will increase but you won’t be mining for today’s price. Everyone who buys or mines a coin is betting on the future price of the coin going up. Otherwise there would be no incentive. The miners are also not a sunk cost. If the price of Bitcoin keeps increasing the market value of the miner increases as well. You always have an option to sell them.

underworld_doom,"What is ""really good""? How passive do you want to be? 

You said in another comment you have 50 amps - but miners are super loud, hot, and need good airflow. Profits can get evaporated at small scale by bad quality ASICs, power supply failures, unstable internet - all stuff you need to monitor. Hosting companies have huge markups and uncertain deployment dates. 

If you really want to start mining, that's awesome - but doing it with expectations of unrealistic returns can light your $65k on fire quickly, with little to show for it, especially if you are doing it at small scale.",i79412i,uhwgxg,/r/BitcoinMining/comments/uhwgxg/interested_in_starting_minint/i79412i/,1,BitcoinMining,2022-05-04 04:15:36

WhiteDogNC,"Trying to control the ambient air entering the ASICs is a very difficult task, and is never cost efficient.  It also depends on the size of the room/container of the miners.  A large space can use a dehumidifier fairly effectively, but AC units cost too much in electricity and will always lose against the heat generation of ASICs.  

Moving large amounts of air is key.  Cycling the full volume of air between intake to exhaust should be multiple times per hour.  If you are properly pulling in, then exhaust, and replacing the ambient air every four to six minutes, using AC units, dehumidifiers, or other equipment, just won’t change the air much.",i7a5bmr,ui23ll,/r/BitcoinMining/comments/ui23ll/how_do_you_guys_deal_with_high_humidity/i7a5bmr/,3,BitcoinMining,2022-05-04 11:59:12

AsicJungle,"Buying miners shouldn't be difficult, but unfortunately it can be.

For your questions:

1) You are welcome to go to the manufacturer, however it is most likely that you will have to purchase a larger order of miners at a time or they are unavailable. This may not be the cheapest option as well.

2) Hi :) we can help

3) You are always welcome to ask if the supplier takes credit cards, however most resellers do not. The most common forms of payment are through bank wire or USDT. 

4) Depends on where you are/electricity costs etc. Currently you could purchase 1 S19J Pro just below 10K, or look into Whatsminers for a slightly cheaper option (both for BTC). 

If you have more questions, or are looking to purchase ASICs, you're welcome to DM us. Happy mining!",i7k2rqk,ujlsw6,/r/BitcoinMining/comments/ujlsw6/why_is_it_so_difficult_to_buy_an_asic_miner/i7k2rqk/,2,BitcoinMining,2022-05-06 14:19:47

EastCoastASICRepair,"Very good question. We are working on a spreadsheet for this information per machine.

Basic rule of thumb you need to be blowing pressurized air in your machine and psu once a week if not at least once a month.

We also recommend monthly deep cleanings/ ultrasonic.

By following those simple rules you will extend the lifespan of your machine by at-least double it in most cases.

Now if you have heat management and airflow failures then you can have a lot of problems specially with Bitmain S series. When this happens you could have failing ASICS or worse power management issues or PSU problems. This issue will on average cost $200 per board to repair. Parts prices vary based on the model and scarcity so i averaged it out and included it in that repair cost.

Most folks with a warranty send it back to the manufacturer, but if not there are repair facilities in the USA like us. It requires a decent amount of equipment and testing materials to diagnose and repair them so most of the time a repair center is needed. Fans and control boards can be replaced by you easily, but don’t fail as often as the hash boards do.

AndrewAwakened,"For me, Texas wins hands down for a couple reasons:

This won’t apply to everyone, but since I’m in the US I’d prefer to have my miners in the same country. I used to travel internationally all the time and the company I work for does a lot of importing, and the pandemic really opened my eyes to how much I had been taking easy movement across borders for granted.

Texans have oil and gas in their blood, so the state is unlikely to enact energy legislation hostile to crypto mining. With Canada on the other hand it wouldn’t surprise me one bit if we woke up tomorrow to find they had introduced restrictions on mining as part of some climate change policy.

Although Texas has had issues with power supply in winter months recently, I don’t expect this will be an ongoing issue.

And no, I do not believe Texas will secede any time soon. Things would have to go a lot farther than they have for that idea to gain enough support, and the upcoming elections will likely shift the balance of power to a degree that Texans in general are happier with. Plus there are a lot of questions regarding whether Texas could actually legally secede anyway.",i7mxmdl,ujw1gu,/r/BitcoinMining/comments/ujw1gu/long_term_hosting_stability/i7mxmdl/,1,BitcoinMining,2022-05-07 03:24:26

Leader92,"I agree with the profitability lasting 5-7 past release date . However, if you want your miner to last longer both functionally and economically. I recommend you look into immersion cooling. It all boils down to the fact that liquid is 20x more efficient in dissipating heat than air.

Furthermore, it is superior to air cooling because; 

* Temperature fluctuations harm the miner long-term. In immersion, you create a stable environment for the miner to hash without sudden changes in temperature. 
* No noise, fans are removed which saves 15-20% on power consumption. 
* Ability to overclock your miner as high as 30%. A guy on YouTube immersed his S19J pro 104T and overclocked it to 130Th/s stably. Some took it a step further and modified the PSU to 6,000W and overclocked their JPros to 170 Th/s (only doable in immersion)
* dust and debris reduce miner performance, which requires periodic dissembling and cleaning. In immersion, the hashboards remain clean as new, considering no liquid contamination. 

Cons

* Voids warrenty. 
* Expensive infrastructure; you could build an immersion setup for as little as $500, but if your plan is to immerse your miner for years and keep the system operational 24/7, you'd need to invest in high-quality materials (\~$1500 combined for high end pump, radiator, and fan)
* Leak; which is a nightmare and inevitable. I'm considering changing my setup and using a submersible pump just so I could reduce leak-points. 
* Liquid; ASIC dielectric liquids are expensive. Bitcool goes for $180 per 20L, and the smallest system needs 45-50L. I'm currently experiencing with a premium transformer oil that has similar properties to Bitcool and is two and a half times cheaper.

BitcoinRefiner,"Hello,  


My understanding and input would be that you cannot simply class efficiency &amp; price by chip size (nm). You'll need to do this by hardware model (e.g. S9, S15, S17, S19, A7, A8, A9, A10, A11, A12, M20S, M30S etc.) You could do this by ASIC chip model, but, that is a harder way to calculate and would be easier to reverse engineer back from a data set focused on each SHA256 ASIC model.  


Here is a good resource to assist: [https://www.asicminervalue.com/](https://www.asicminervalue.com/)  


Miner values also change over time. S9's were $1200, then $2,500, then $5,000, then $25, then back to $350 and back down again. You'll need to decide how you measure price of device, whether that is at a certain point in time or otherwise.

callebbb,"For us to meet our green energy goals, we will need to produce roughly 15x the current generation capabilities we have today, due to how green energy sources are intermittent sources of power. The sun doesn’t shine all day, and the wind doesn’t always blow. Droughts come, and dams go low. 

This is why our energy infrastructure is FORCED to expand by a factor of 10 at least. The problem with building our generation capability is the lack of demand. Currently we have a decent amount of consistent generation capability, ie Fossil Fuels, and phasing those out too early would leave our grid crippled. 

The pitch is Bitcoin Miners allow energy generators to have a buyer of last resort, so to speak, and the economic activity from Bitcoin mining will help subsidize a green energy transformation WITHOUT debasing currency via government subsidies and graft.

Most people can't get a loan to simply buy BTC.  Some people can get business loans to buy equipment for their business however.. 

The price I pay for a miner these days ($7500 / 100th S19) would get me about .25 BTC.

Ala_Bill,"I wanted badly to be a Bitcoin miner instead of just buying BTC but after building my own spreadsheet including the change in difficulty every two weeks, it became apparent that it was less risky to just buy Bitcoin. When you add to that is that we are about 104,000 blocks (approximately 22 months) away from the block reward changing from 6.5 per block to 3.25 per block. 

What this means is that the amount of block reward in BTC will be half of what it is today. The really good insight of the [http://smokinghopium.io/](http://smokinghopium.io/) app is that is prices your current purchase of a miner in Bitcoins and shows how long it takes to break even compared to just purchasing the Bitcoin.

So for me I am averaging into Bitcoin by purchasing every month instead of buying a bunch of miners. The smokinghopium app is way more realistic that one who takes today's hash rate and assumes the same return for the next month and the next year. You have to make your own choice, but for me it's averaging in instead of mining.",i86o8kh,umu9p4,/r/BitcoinMining/comments/umu9p4/bitcoin_roi_on_miners/i86o8kh/,2,BitcoinMining,2022-05-11 13:59:02

I basically treat them as a recurring lotto ticket, which has the chance to mine a block every ten minutes or so! You can pick them up used on eBay or new on ships like BitcoinMerch. Just do your research first. Make sure you know what you’re buying, and whether the place you are getting them is legit.

dhork,"In a real bitcoin miner setup there are JSON APIs which you can use to query your local bitcoin node for the information of the current block you are mining, and the same APIs can be used to send back the valid nonce. Finding valid blocks is hard; validating them is easy. So the node validates that the block is valid, then forwards it on to the rest of the peer to peer network.

In your position though, you will never find an actual block on your own, so you are better off interfacing with a mining pool instead. Mining pools work by distributing rewards based on the total amount of work done by all miners. If you hit a block for a mining pool you don't get anywhere close to the whole reward, but all the times you don't hit a block you still get a small payout. But what this means is that the targets that mining polls give you are much smaller than the real difficulty, and if you find shares in the mining pool, that's the same thing as finding blocks when mining fit the purposes of your FPGA rig. (I seem to recall bfgminer van be used for that -- it expects a serial interface between the PC and the FPGA rig though)

AndrewAwakened,"You would have to have extremely cheap electricity rates to make it worth mining with such an old miner as an S9 - currently you won’t even cover the cost of power if you’re paying more than 4 cents per KWH, and that will get progressively worse over time unless the price of BTC increases.

Go to www.asicminervalue.com and scroll down to the very bottom of the list and input your electricity rate. Then you can see which miners on the list could work for your situation. And don’t forget that BTC difficulty will increase by say 5% per month on average, so what’s profitable now may not necessarily be profitable even 6 months from now.",i8i0wdn,up0r4n,/r/BitcoinMining/comments/up0r4n/should_i_start_mining_btc_in_2022_and_if_so_which/i8i0wdn/,1,BitcoinMining,2022-05-13 21:05:56

d57heinz,Usually If it’s free you are the product.  It wouldn’t be hard to underreport your hashrate a small bit.  Do that with all the miners and the extra goes to an admin account.  It would be equivalent of slush letting a miner mine on the pool with bad code and then paying them out anyway because reasons.  That miner would have never found a block and technically wasn’t contributing other than diluting rewards to the other miners.  Honesty the more I think about this I wonder if they were early testing code for asic boost. Anyway. Off topic. Sorry.  Hopefully that’s not the case here.  I don’t know how someone can do that other than it helps them to find blocks faster.  If they have a serious drought on blocks(bad luck) and the pool is small folks will leave quickly.  See Kano pool.  They now go months before finding blocks.  For a small miner that has to pay the bills every month.

Mystere_Miner,"I think you have some misunderstandings.

1) You won't receive any reward from simply validating blocks.  That's something every node does for free.

2) If you just use bitcoin core to access the blockchain, you're essentially just doing the same work that core already did.

3) You receive rewards by CREATING blocks, which is what mining is effectively.  Essentially, you take a bunch of transactions from the mempool, create a block (for most people, pools do this for them), and then hash it against the sha256 protocol, changing the nonce for every attempt.  This is the brute force or ""proof of work"" that gets you paid.

IgnitionMining,"$250K budget, $0.07-0.09 electricity rate.

Here is some school of thoughts, basing the quote on bitmain’s official price as of this week.

TLDR: Safe bet, S19Pro-110TH 30 units, More risk for slightly more reward if betting on BTC to go up by quite a substantial amount in near future, S19-95TH. S19XP will have a hefty per TH price tag. 

1. Get as many “newest” machines as possible. Those machines have highest efficiency so when mining difficulties going up in the future (and the halving), your machines can still function and generate some profit. That would be something like 30 X S19Pro-110TH (~8300 each with shipping, if you have tariff you have to factor it in yourself for your country). 

2. Get as much hashrate as possible. It will require more energy and in turn a higher hashrate and a bigger profit margin that is in positive correlation with the bitcoin price. You will be getting 41 S19-95TH (~6100 per including shipping).

You will get 10% more hashrate with option 2 but have a 30% bigger electricity bill. You will win with option 2 if Bitcoin goes a lot higher than it’s current level. Otherwise you will have a big bill.

S19XP right now is about $15-20 more expensive per TH, because it is new. Best to wait a little bit to see what price action on that particular model would be.",i8wu99y,urak7p,/r/BitcoinMining/comments/urak7p/if_you_had_250k/i8wu99y/,9,BitcoinMining,2022-05-17 05:01:55

WUPAccessCrypto,"My recommendation would be the Jasminer
X4-1U. This miner is super compact, only 240 watts. Which means that at 220v with a 30 amp breaker you can run 22 units. That is insane compared to a Bitcoin miner. At the same time very low heat and super quiet. Now you with be mining ETH or ETC. With the state of the market it is still bringing in an estimated $18.00 a day per unit. We own a lot of these miners and this number is 100% confirmed. If you do not want to hold ETH or ETC you can just sell the coins for USDC and wait for the next dip and buy Bitcoin. Or there some mining pools that offer the pay our in BTC. Which might be an easier way to get paid out. Even with an electrical cost of $0.07 per KWh your are looking at $5.46 per day on a BTC miner compared to $0.40 for a Jasminer X4-1U.

No electrician cost as the co-location will have all the setup ready.,i93phuk,usgfji,/r/BitcoinMining/comments/usgfji/i_want_to_make_about_10k_a_month/i93phuk/,2,BitcoinMining,2022-05-18 18:12:52
IgnitionMining,"First variable to consider is how much your electricity cost is. Let’s say you are in the US and your electricity cost is residential. You are very likely to be paying $0.09 per kWh. Each S19jPro rig is going to cost 0.09 X 3.050 X 30 X 24 = $197.6 (Price X Consumption X 30 days a month X 24 hours). Every day, at current difficulty, you are very likely to mine 0.00042-43 BTC a day. That is around $13 daily and $390 monthly.

You are going to make $192.4 per machine per month. For calculation’s sake let’s assume it is $200.

So at $30k per BTC. You will need around 50 machines, running at residential electricity rate to make a $10K profit.

Each machine will cost $7700 or so. That would be 
$385,000 total. 

For electricity rate at $0.055 per kWh (which is more common for commercial use). You will need about 37 machines to make $10K per month after electricity cost. And that would be about $285K.

In both cases, since you will be running multiple machines in the same facility, you will need some work done by your electricians to support the load. That would cost another $15k probably. All miscellaneous costs to set up (rack space, ventilation, PDU) is another $10K.

So, depending on your electricity cost the whole operation will have a different budget. Also, sometimes you can also consider hosting with reputable hosts.

Leader92,"People keep telling you that you'd need 26-28 S19J Pros for this kind of income, but if you dive into immersion cooling, you could get 2,800 hashrate with 20-21 machines only. With silicon lottery in mind, you could overclock each machine 25% to 30% giving you 2,700 hashrate with 21 machines only.

With the $40,000 you have saved from buying extra machines, invest in a high-quality immersion setup. Either DIY or through an ASIC immersion company.

Not to mention that you'd get lower power consumption and therefore less $ per Th, given how efficient these machines run under dielectric liquid.

I don't want to get into Mod PSU and potentially overclocking a number of these machines to 170 Th/s, but there's alot you could do and money you could save if you took those fans off.

Delicious-Heat1314,"We are using solar in Australia to run small farms, say 10-45 miners per site during the day, grid for the night. Some things to consider and in no particular order.

1. Get a solar engineer to calculate the solar production for the year. They can do this from local weather data and gives you a fair idea of how many kwh the system is likely to produce over the entire year
2. Ensure your roof is structurally suitable for the weight of the solar panels
3. If you plan to mine long term, solar panels and inverters will go well for 15-25 years, so the cost benefit really stacks up when you apply this time frame to it. Even better if, say at the end of 25 years that all you will do is upgrade the panels and inverter at that time, takes half the cost out of it
4. It is not worth using your solar to charge your battery imo, advise maxing out you solar with miners during the day, charge the battery at night in off peak rates when the power is cheap. This should hopefully get you through your peak pricing periods
5. We have looked at larger battery systems, life span is say 5 years before degradation, hard to get a pay back on them unless you find a really cheap supplier. Cost of lithium battery minerals is through the roof at the moment as well. Hopefully will improve as the battery tech improves. Add up your kwh usage with those machines, your going to need a heap of battery storage to run them when solar is not producing. Its about 150kwh over 6 hours yeah?",i9rzogs,uvwtxs,/r/BitcoinMining/comments/uvwtxs/solar_viable_for_a_small_asic_farm/i9rzogs/,3,BitcoinMining,2022-05-24 06:03:10

bryguy4436,"&gt;According to research released this week, carbon-intensive bitcoin mining might cause China to overshoot its emissions reduction objectives.

&gt;According to the survey, China accounts for 75 percent of global bitcoin mining due to inexpensive power and relatively simple access to manufacturers of specialist hardware. As a result, according to the research, the country's bitcoin carbon footprint is equivalent to one of its ten largest cities.

You are quoting an article from April of 2021.  Not recent or even remotely accurate.

&gt;According to Cambridge University research, the country's proportion of global bitcoin mining capacity fell to zero in July and August 2021 after officials initiated a new crackdown on cryptocurrency.

This article directly contradicts what you stayed above.  The latest Information is that china has around 20% of the global hashrate.

Bitcoin mining accounts for an estimated 0.08% of the global emissions.",i9usu86,ux0d5y,/r/BitcoinMining/comments/ux0d5y/bitcoin_mining_has_made_china_helpless/i9usu86/,2,BitcoinMining,2022-05-24 21:11:34

I absolutely can help.  Email me at Richard@meta-luban.com.  DM for my phone number and we can schedule a call.  Check out the website www.meta-luban.com for more information regarding ASICs, mining containers, and repair.  Also an article on the owner Mark Zhou https://cryptofireside.com/meet-mark-zhou-the-chinese-entrepreneur-building-a-global-cryptocurrency-mining-ecosystem-f3b63234b9f9    

We have access to land and electricity in southern Texas through our network of vendors and business partners.  Also can arrange financing through Hash Capital Partners and Ridgestone Capital (usually for the ASICs only, 20% down, short terms).  Tell your boss it’s not totally “turn key” and “just throw money at it”, you need a crew at your site to receive and assemble the modular mining container, someone local to be in touch with inspection, and safe storage as you receive ASICs (you can’t drop $14M in product on a dirt lot and hope to have it all safe in an 8 hour day…) but others are doing this same plan.

Would you want to build a data center in your backyard? If so all of the items below aren’t useful and all you need is a piece of flat graveled land. Nothing big, just enough for a small shed or container, that’s all you need. You also need to think about security as 300kw is 100 rigs and is still over half-a-million US dollars.

If you are looking for another piece of land to build on, there are several items on the checklist.

1. Is there convenient access for trucks to drive in and out? You will need to to haul in your equipments.

2. Is the area close to other residences? The rule of thumb is **1km (or half a mile) away**, also will differ a bit with local noise bylaws. Because the operation involves 100 machines you will need to consider the noise levels. We use this metaphor to our clients, each S19 equals to a hair dryer running non-stop. 

3. Zoning: **Light or heavy industrial zoning** is the best.

DeFiAntUnderMiner,"In short, lack of availability caused by the silicon chip shortage combined with huge demand and a very greedy market.

1. Manufacturers price gouge

2. Scalpers and resellers then further contribute to price increases

3. I speculate that some of the more nefarious manufacturers secretly pre-mine prior to releasing their equipment for sale, and this withholding of equipment would also temporarily decrease demand

4. Because of the scarcity, buyers are often forced to purchase second-hand or from resellers and this is a cesspit of scams.

5. Logistics issues and transportation of ASIC hardware (often across borders) safely without damage to equipment.

6. Geopolitical factors, such as introduction of regulation, changes to regulation or in extreme cases complete prohibition such as in China. Of course, this varies depending on your region/ mining location.

Then, assuming you can acquire a decent ASIC without getting scammed you have to consider your overall business model in terms of ROI and massive fluctuations in revenue and costs, such as network difficulty increases, fluctuating BTC price and increased power costs.",ib3lbwz,v4662w,/r/BitcoinMining/comments/v4662w/what_are_the_biggest_challenges_in_buying_bitcoin/ib3lbwz/,2,BitcoinMining,2022-06-04 00:44:59

IgnitionMining,"Think of it this way, mining is essentially turning electricity into BTC. 

How efficient mining is, depends on how much you pay in electricity. The more you pay, the less efficient it gets.

For example, if you are in California where electricity bill is $0.2 or more per kWh. Just buy BTC. Otherwise actually in a lot of countries in the world, it is still quite worth it to mine still.

cookmanager,"No, not always cheaper, and here is a good way to think about it:

Buying Bitcoin is a long play of Bitcoin.  Mining Bitcoin is a long play of Bitcoin plus a mix of other factors such as global hashrate growth (mining competition,) electrical rates, rates growth, etc. where altogether you can compare your net BTC at the end of the journey.

You need to look at your own situation, and see if you have initial costs of the miners low enough and sufficiently low electrical rates to determine if mining is more beneficial than buying spot.

There are good online calculators (Braiins is one I thought good,) or I also built a spreadsheet for sale (3,000 sats, bitcoin only) on https://modulo.network that let’s you do the comparison of mining vs. spot in Excel",ib4d46z,v4gw57,/r/BitcoinMining/comments/v4gw57/is_it_always_cheaper_to_mine_btc_rather_than/ib4d46z/,3,BitcoinMining,2022-06-04 05:50:05
DeFiAntUnderMiner,"Absolutely not, often miners are awarded more BTC than their costing otherwise mining wouldn't ever be profitable. However their are many instances where purchasing BTC at spot price is cheaper than mining.

It depends on a while heap of variables, some of them being;

1. The spot price of BTC (the market)
2. The price of electricity
3. The hardware being used to mine
4. The cost of the mining hardware
5. Any other costs associated with mining, eg. lease costs, repairs, labor costs etc.

Large well resourced mining farms consistently mine BTC for less than the spot price. An amateur miner may struggle to emulate such efficiency, however.

Personally, I've been mining BTC for over 5 years and I would probably be better off long term if I had simply purchased the bitcoin rather than mining hardware. But I enjoy what I do, its a very well paying hobby.",ib4d7u3,v4gw57,/r/BitcoinMining/comments/v4gw57/is_it_always_cheaper_to_mine_btc_rather_than/ib4d7u3/,4,BitcoinMining,2022-06-04 05:51:26

Fabulous_Fix_4965,"I see a lot of basic and advanced knowledge on here. I don’t know exactly what you plan but here is some knowledge I hope helps. 

In your breaker box you will find two metal rails feeding breakers and each is 120V source. In the box is also 4 wires, ground, Neutral (white typically), and two hots (typically black and red). A 220V breaker is attached to the two rails and the hot wires are attached to it. Those wires plus white (and ground) are ran out to a receptacle at the wall. This is what you plug your machine into using a PDU (power distribution unit) which can be a simple splitter or a high tech internet enabled box. 

Important: to reach 220V , you cannot combine two random 110V outlets. Unless you know for sure they are each on a different rail and even then it is a bad idea to have your machine using power from two different breakers. I highly recommend you get a proper 220V breaker installed with 12 gauge wire ran to receptacle.",ibdhvim,v5lp7g,/r/BitcoinMining/comments/v5lp7g/s19_220v/ibdhvim/,1,BitcoinMining,2022-06-06 15:15:18

There was also an insane arbitrage opportunity where you could sell your used miners for more than you paid for them new.

zuaris10036,"I have heard about a lot of these arguments and analyzed the numbers in detail and here is my perspective. Could be right or wrong, I don't know.

1. Tax perspective - whether you miner or bitcoin you can always write off the cost basis. If you counting on the fact that you will write off miners and will not account for bitcoin earned in the long run, I think it's a risk. As regulations get introduced, these holes will be plugged. Extrapolating the current dynamics into future is risky.

2. Bitcoin mined - ideally anyone is looking to get into bitcoin mining but cannot host the machines themselves, should always have some cash on the books to pay for opex. Based on today's prices, if I have $35,000 Capex and another $30,000 in opex, you are simply better off buying Bitcoin. At current prices you will get more than 2 bitcoin and based on expected rise in difficulty and hash rate you will take forever to mine 2 bitcoins.

3. Time period- there are so many uncertainties and costs with bitcoin hosting for 3 years and more. Your machine breaks down, your hosting facilities shut down, other things happen. Someone who wants to own bitcoin stress free, buying is better at the current prices

In conclusion, you might have 10-20% extra bitcoin by mining but there is a chance of also having 10-20% less bicoin or even worst. Since there is major upside, I am more concerned about protecting downside, which is achieved bitcoin by buying at this price, than buying.

zuaris10036,That's exactly my point. New miners should not think about this in the form of fiat investment. They should convert the fiat investment to buy machine and fund operating expense into BTC and evaluate how much bitcoin they will mine during a three year period. Bitcoin mine should be atleast 2x of your investment to adequately ensure its worth the risk,ica76fk,vbg78m,/r/BitcoinMining/comments/vbg78m/cheaper_miners_now/ica76fk/,1,BitcoinMining,2022-06-14 02:38:06

Bucketalinko,"As another comment pointed out the minimum order is 200, I went to place an order and got hit with the minimum 200 unit order. it also says if you buy for the October batch its only $2175 so I'd be willing to wait to save the extra money.  


Im assuming this is aimed at people who can generate their own power cheaply, perhaps businesses that have their own hydro power for example would benefit from this best with the 200 unit order. Myself I have enough solar and battery stored energy to run one for 16 hours a day for no electricity cost which would put my buy back period at under 250 days at current price (at the $2175) , and considering the current market price I'd say that's pretty reasonable. So their target audience definitely isnt for the average home miner paying a standard electricity bill.

Mr_Pocket_,There does appear to be a lag in miner price adjustment both up and down.

Second thing to think about is ROI. Every hour you run a miner it contributes to to paying itself back. You will only export for 4 to 5 hours. And not for 20. Meaning it will take 5 times longer to pay it off. That number is currently around 4 to 5 years on Asic miners so you talking 25 year plus. It will never ROI.

Many people bought miners last year, when everyone knew that BTC was going to hit $100k by Christmas.  Now that BTC is tanking, some folks are getting close to a net profit of zero.

But suppose the price keeps dropping.  The cost of the miner is a sunk cost.  If such people stop mining, maybe they lose $5k.  But if they keep mining, maybe they can cut their losses to $2k.

Big-Internet6235,"My primary customer has experimented with us shutting his miners off for 24 hours periods here and there in exchange for credit. The power company actually pays us a portion of what our ""would-be usuage"" is during periods of heavy grid demand in exchange for turning off non-essential machines and equipment.

As far as customers just turning their miners off, we have no issue doing so. Customers pay for whatever the power is that their machines consume, plus a monthly colocation fee. The monthly fee stands regardless of whether the machines are running or not because they're still taking up data-center space regardless. But we'd never force a customer to keep running their equipment if it's operating at below the ""break even"" point and/or they request that we shut them off.

The reason why some places are doing this is because in order to qualify for lower rates, they have to meet a certain demand or load factor each month, and shutting half the machines off would likely cause them to disqualify for the lower power rates or fall back to a lower tariff level.",id2ulp3,vglkws,/r/BitcoinMining/comments/vglkws/hosting_company_is_not_allowing_people_to_shut/id2ulp3/,10,BitcoinMining,2022-06-20 17:02:30

It isn’t then it’s costly and maybe you don’t even get your equipment back.  Cloud mining has always been the greatest scam of crypto. Hosted isn’t far behind due to the contracts.  How fucking stupid is it to mine below profitability.  If you signed the deal let this be a lesson to you and anyone else thinking this is a great way to mine.  Leave it to someone else and you surely end up losing out.  This will never work with the volatile nature of crypto.  Ask yourself why would a company let you take the profits when they could just do it themselves.  This is the reason. Downturns of the market bring on huge risks. They dump that risk onto you so they can acquire cheaper rates for their own equipment.  This busines model shouldn’t work in clients favor nor ever will.

jdoingj,"Around 100 Th/s will produce about 46,000 sats/day at current network difficulty.  You can model this going forward by calculating the daily bitcoin generated and using a variable to adjust the difficulty every two weeks.  Using the past few years as a reference the difficulty adjustment averages about 1.5% so your income will go down by about that much on average every two weeks.  Set this up in your spreadsheet as a variable and then in each row calculate the expected income per day. 

Don't forget to cut your income in half sometime around 5/2024 and then every 4 years after that.  You can now adjust the expected difficulty changes to see what may happen.  If prices stay around 20K for a year or two I wouldn't expect the difficulty to continue to increase at that rate and it may stay roughly the same for a while.  You will be able to adjust this in the sheet.  

Add a cell that totals up all the coin generated and you can adjust your difficulty setting to see how this may change.

Now with that being said I use my dual GPU rig as free heat in winter, so I can gladly start cpu mining on it for the couple more watts of electric heat which using ""free"" electricity with an I9 10ksomething was 30 cents per day.

That being said, you might have legal recourse as obviously you were defrauded. And that's outside of the actual Coin itself, so I can't see why normal laws wouldn't apply. You simply paid for a service and / or product. It's not like it was a coin transaction, is what I'm getting at. I'm assuming they're out of country, so that complicates it a bit, but you should still fight it.

Never assume it's because they're inept, that's the excuse lazy thieves use as their first line of defense, and for some reason even in politics it still works. We are both inept, and also powerful experts (they usually say that about the opposition though.)

Worse, they lie. I've got miners in Russia. When war broke out I wrote and asked to get my miners out. They said not to worry--that their hosting facility was connected to the top of the Russian government. I pointed out that this was worisome in itself if sanctions hit. They told me that if anything happened, they could get the miners out.
That was a lie. I have six miners stranded in Russia and Compass has done nothing.

bryguy4436,"Crypto Miner Says Hosting Co. Is Holding Machines Hostage
By Elise Hansen ·  Listen to article
Law360 (June 22, 2022, 7:03 PM EDT) -- Cryptocurrency mining company Compass has sued its facility provider in Delaware Chancery Court, arguing that the hosting company is holding equipment ""hostage"" and hasn't been maintaining the facilities properly.
Compass Mining Inc. said Tuesday that Dynamics Corp., which does business as Dynamics 2K, had not let it access one of its Maine facilities and might even be using the on-site equipment for its own purposes. Compass provides computers for cryptocurrency mining and access to hosting facilities where mining can take place, according to the complaint.

Cryptocurrency mining is the process of verifying transactions for inclusion in the public record and putting new tokens into circulation. The process is computationally intensive and typically requires specialized computers. Larger operations frequently involve facilities like data centers.

Compass said it contracted with Dynamics late last year to establish various hosting facilities at three different Maine locations. Compass said it had paid about $1.7 million toward the facilities' construction and operation, but Dynamics had not fulfilled its end of the bargain.

""Despite Compass' sizable payments, Dynamics has failed to materially advance development of one facility, neglected the facilities, and even failed to provide power to the facilities in recent days,"" the complaint said.

Dynamics also allegedly denied Compass access to a site and the mining equipment there, which Compass said was worth about $4.5 million. Compass argued that Dynamics seemed to be ""holding this valuable equipment hostage to gain leverage"" in payment negotiations.

Dynamics may even by using the on-site equipment to mine cryptocurrency itself or on behalf of one of its own customers, Compass said.

""Compass brings this action to enforce its lawful right to access the Lewiston [Maine] facility, to secure and repossess the miners and cease any unauthorized use thereof, and to collect the significant amounts owed to it by Dynamics.""

Compass is alleging breach of contract, conversion and unjust enrichment. It's seeking a court order barring Dynamics from operating, moving, selling or disposing of the mining equipment and allowing Compass onto the property. Compass is also asking for disgorgement of any ill-gotten gains, compensatory damages, punitive damages and other relief.",idoikf7,vkbcxo,/r/BitcoinMining/comments/vkbcxo/compassmining/idoikf7/,4,BitcoinMining,2022-06-25 12:31:44

accidentalnegligence,"Yup, I have 4 miners in BitRiver that were through compass. 

Russia was a risk,  but I didn't imagine total write-off was feasible, especially when I specifically went through a ""reputable"" company with guaranteed uptime, and told me of minimal risk during a sales call.

I was just shocked how they washed their hands with the situation, then tried to pass the crap back to us. Our relationship is with compass, and theirs with the hosting facility - any issues at the facility is the onus of Compass Mining

They updated their T&amp;Cs, I asked for a copy of the old ones and they banned me from discord.

Might be worth getting everyone who had miners at BitRiver together to make sure we continue to communicate and if any holes appear/duties not fulfilled by Compass we can work together as a group for action.

opticbit,"Trust wallet is a Bitcoin wallet. I'm not familiar with it, there are many others that are similar.

It looks like one of the wallets that might have an exchange built in.

Someone can train you how to use wallets and exchanges.

But when they say they can tell you how to 10x your money, something is wrong.

There are certain flaws in some of the software, and scammers will take advantage of your trust in their training.

There's a few things  to learn on wallets and exchanges as base knowledge. But trading profitably is hard.  The ""experts"" on wall Street have to try hard to beat the s&amp;p500 at about 10% per year.

Bitcoin was not meant to be for speculation and easy profits but people have turned it into that, and scammers take advantage of people looking for options.

Bitcoin is for anyone to use and send a payment to anyone else with a wallet, no matter who you are, you just need a device with an internet connection.

Things to look at to start off. The Bitcoin White Paper, the Myths and FAQ page. Use the reference wallet. most coins are open source so there is no ""official"" wallet. The reference wallet could be called the unofficial official wallet.  Some wallets will do multi coins. Learn the basics first.

321-backup your seed
3 copies
2 different mediums (pen and paper one, USB stick text file for second as an example)
1 off site, away from home.

Your seed generates a private key, and from the private key, a public key.

Not your keys (seed) not your coins, if it's on an exchange you likely don't have the keys.

The public key you can give to anyone, all they can do is send to you, and depending on the coin see the balance.

Always check the first and last few characters of where you send.

When you send it's permanent so make sure you trust whoever you send to (unless multisig escrow)

Make sure you are in contact with who you think it is. Lots of impersonators, and fake people out there will make all kinds of promises to get you to send stupid amounts of coin to them. Fake profiles in messaging apps, or fake websites, all kinds of things scammers will do. Many of them involve investing in trading, or mining, or lending.",idwamm0,vllhhc,/r/BitcoinMining/comments/vllhhc/am_i_being_scammed_or_is_it_legit/idwamm0/,2,BitcoinMining,2022-06-27 05:27:41

underworld_doom,"It would depend on what the business person / company is looking to achieve from the venture. You should tailor your pitch to the audience. 

There are a few reasons to run a mine:

1. Hope to make a profit from coins mined now and their value in the future - The upfront infrastructure costs and continual hardware costs make the margin relatively low here. Most situations it is better to buy on the spot market than generate coins if you're investing for coin profit.  
2. Running infrastructure for their product/service that requires blocks - This is where you can highlight the extra security, options, and ability to customize the way the node creates blocks or picks transactions to put into those blocks
3. Running infrastructure to support decentralization: This one would probably influence scale of the mine. You can do this without having an industrial mine.

dhork,"You're right that the IRS can't possibly know when you mine something. But at some point you may sell that coin for dollars, and when you do odds are you will be selling it at an exchange that does have visibility to the IRS.

If you never declared it when you mined it, then it will all hit your tax return as income, and taxed at your normal rate. (If its a large enough sale, it might end up triggering an audit flag and they may ask for supporting documentation about it, and that could lead to trouble).

OTOH, if you declared the coins as income in the year they are mined, then when you sell you have already established a cost basis and you will only be taxed on the change in value since the time you mined it.  Furthermore, if you hold the mined coins for over a year, you will be able to take the lower capital gains tax rate. You might also be able to deduct mining expenses against that initial income, but you might want to hire a tax pro for advice on that.

So, you take a bit of a tax hit in the short term, but it spreads your tax hit over multiple years, and may also lead to lower taxes paid if you have long term gains.",iee96p2,vokhe7,/r/BitcoinMining/comments/vokhe7/eli5_reasons_to_report_mined_nonkyc_coin_on_taxes/iee96p2/,6,BitcoinMining,2022-07-01 01:18:27

If you mined 100 bitcoin while only reporting income from a 20$/h job, and you suddenly start buying houses and lambos, the tax agency will start taking interest into your activities and cincome streams. 

Put another way, is the mining income higher then what I could realistically save with my day job income? Then report it. If it comes out to just what you’d spend daily on a mocha frappuccino and avocado toast at your local bistro, meh, don’t bother reporting. 

You also need to look at this from a time perspective. Your 0.1btc might be worth 2000$ today, but should bitcoin reach 10,000,000$, you now have a million dollars, and you might want to spend it.

BitcoinRefiner,"Number 2. Is likely incorrect: If you deposit mined coin to any wallet which interfaces with a cryptocurrency exchange, simple blockchain analytics with the assistance of the exchange will reveal to government the underlying mining wallet and they can easily extrapolate what you mined and when.

levicam,"The big thing to keep in mind that a stock Bitmain fan (for example as it's the most common) pulls about 230 CFM at 6000 RPM. If it's a dual stack like the S19 or L7, it's basically double. With that in mind, I plan out pulling in about 10% more air to be safe and prevent sucking my home's AC in through the cracks in my basement. 

I do this through a 12"" duct fan pulling over 1000 CFM from a window in the basement to feed an S19 and L7. I feed the air into a manifold I made from foam insulation board. Then I also have duct fans on the exhaust which draw roughly 500 CFM each. This has the side benefit of keeping the Bitmain fans running slower, hence more quiet.

Since doing this I've noticed a remarkable difference in the temps of the house and no longer have cooling issues in the rest of the house (which I did have before getting enough fresh air to the miners.)",iek8kdt,vpcvpe,/r/BitcoinMining/comments/vpcvpe/air_intake_solutions/iek8kdt/,2,BitcoinMining,2022-07-02 10:19:05

levicam,"You should be able to figure rates by talking to the landlord as they'll have the most recent statement and better understand the electric companies rate structure. If the location doesn't have enough power for you, it can be very expensive to run if the power company needs to add infrastructure to do it. If it's got a larger transformer nearby, it may be simple and cheap to upgrade a service drop. Generally a power company will upgrade the line to your electric meter, you're responsible (or the landlord if you negotiate that) for everything from the meter to inside your structure.

As far as how big a panel you need, the rule is not loading any more than 80% of any one circuit or the overall panel. For planning purposes, assume you have a 200A panel (x4 for your situation.) Rough/theoretical planning numbers below:

200A @ 240V = 48,000W x 80% = 38,400W max on the panel.

If you are running S19 let's say, at 3,200W each, you can fit 38,400 / 3,200 = 12 units per 200A panel.

A 20A/240V breaker can handle up to 3,840W so you'll need one 20A circuit for each miner.

So make sure each 200A panel has at least 24 slots (which most of them are far greater than that.)

If you have four 200A panels, then you can run 48 miners total on that. 

All that said, don't forget that you need to account for everything else in your space that needs power, so possibly look to have one panel, or sub, that controls services and other panels dedicated to miners.",ieu9k0k,vqm97u,/r/BitcoinMining/comments/vqm97u/pro_tips_on_finding_a_small_warehouse_space_what/ieu9k0k/,3,BitcoinMining,2022-07-04 17:20:27

3. PPA (Power Purchase Agreement), this is really important if you are running the facility for the long run.

Also figure out the tax component as it is often 2c per kWh in a pot of states in the US. Get in touch with an energy broker / consultant if you need to.

Stunning-Ask5916,"Here's my unpopular opinion; Compass.

I am a Compass customer.  I ordered hardware in August to be delivered in December. It was actually delivered in April.  But, along the way, they gave me a $500 credit per machine plus one month free.

They don't host machines themselves. They contract with hosts.  They sell machines to consumers and place those machines in the third party facilities.

Russia was bungled.  I leave that to the side.

Other than that, I think they overexpanded and trusted third party hosts that broke promises. There may be something about supply chain issues delaying deliveries.

But the thing they did well, crediting customer accounts to compensate for broken promises, is the thing that is now biting them in the behind.  Right now, I am not paying for the monthly maintenance on the hardware that I bought from them. I suspect that they are paying the third party hosts. I also suspect that they invested their cash in crypto.  That is, they are facing a perfect finances storm.

WhiteDogNC,"Maybe a 6-7 in my opinion.  Excellent price for 90TH. 

Canaan doesn’t have custom firmware like Bitmain Antminers, so you can’t undervolt to get that wattage down.  Your electric is a little too high and the BTC price is a little too low for your miner to be profitable at the moment; you lose about $1 per day. 

The ONLY reason to get a miner is to stack coin faster and cheaper.  If your electric is too high, and you spend $62 per week in electricity to get $54 in today’s BTC price, then you’re paying for the education of mining.  

The people that say, “I’m continuing to mine because I’ll sell at a higher number!!!!1!!” are morons.  Just buy your coin and stop paying the electric, rest your miner until coin price is up again.  The end result is more profit for your crypto.

But I would still hook that thing up and get started.  Learn all the details about mining even if you lose a dollar a day.  You’ll be in a better spot when the coin prices go back up.",if291uf,vscg6g,/r/BitcoinMining/comments/vscg6g/buying_my_first_miner_this_weekend_avalon_1246/if291uf/,8,BitcoinMining,2022-07-06 11:35:37

Classic_Ad3154,"OK, I have a Farm and all my Miners so far are Canaan Avalon A1246 85Ts which I paid between $7,300 &amp; $7,500 for 6 to 8 months ago while they were earning $21 - $24 per machine per day (that was short lived and earnings gradually fell as hashrate increased and then the whole LUNA crash fiasco).

Anyway, if you're getting a brand new machine for that price fine.....or even great.

I'm quoted on new ones at just around $3K right now......and I wish that I could buy 10.......just don't have the funds available at this time.

These machines are relatively reliable....
BUT! 
I.) They are not as popular as Bitmain so finding knowledgeable support or parts is a nightmare. 
2. There is a factory defect in the PSUs with the Power Switch located on the top. It has been corrected on newer machines with the Power Switch located closer to the Power inlet and below a fan but buying a new machine or ordering a new PSU doesn't mean that it's new stock and buying replacement PSUs (like I had to do as Avalon offered to repair instead or replace and the 2 way shipping was equal to the cost of 4 PSUs) could leave you with new old stock with the defect.
3. Generally you have to be willing to learn to scrap this thing down to parts yourself and lean how to swap out components rather than wait on finding a technician to repair components. 
4. You have to figure out stuff.....a replacement 7,000rpm 4 wire fan with the 2 X 2 pin power jack for Avalon is $45 plus $68+ shipping from China......while you can buy a 7,000rpm 4 wire fan with 1 X 4 power jack for Bitmain on Amazon for $24 with free shipping and chop of the jack and swap with the one from your old Avalon fan.

If your Power in reasonable; set up the miner and get mining......it's the only way you'd learn the business so the hopefully when the profit times comes around again you've sorted out all your quirks.

One piece of advice would be to filter every opening where air could get into you mining room even if you have to fan assist on both the in and the out.....it would save years on your machine.


PS: If the price quoted is for a new machine from a legitimate source and you are willing to share such info.....please pm me as I'd love to get a couple machine at that price......if its used; leave it alone and buy a brand new miner. 
0.12 power is high so your rating would be around 4 to 5 out of 10 at this present time; but if it ever goes back to earning over $20 - $24 a day.
You'll go down as a hero.
So forget the ratings and Invest when things are cheap.",if4q39a,vscg6g,/r/BitcoinMining/comments/vscg6g/buying_my_first_miner_this_weekend_avalon_1246/if4q39a/,1,BitcoinMining,2022-07-06 22:13:19

maryhadalittlebrain,"Generating .24 BTC over 15 months with an S19j pro is probably optimistic. Mine has been running since late January and has generated roughly .07 BTC.  Daily generation was around .0005 BTC at first then dropped gradually to around .00041 before recently going back up to around .00045 with the price drop and summer.

With the natural upward pressure on the network hash rate over time, I think even forecasting .0004 BTC per day over 15 months would be a stretch. That would put you at .18 BTC (450 x 0.0004) after 15 months. At current prices you can buy around .23 BTC.

The halving looming in spring 2024 doesn't doesn't help your chance of breaking even either.

SailsAk,"Couple of points here (in no particular order):

1.) Don’t use compass. Search this sub there are plenty of horror stories about them. If you need a decent vendor PM me or someone else you trust. I’m not a vendor I’m just someone who has bought a lot of ASICS from different vendors.


2.) You say you have the proper outlets for 240v that’s fine. I believe you actually have an outlet with nothing else on that circuit that’s at 240v but how big is the breaker? You’ll need at least a 20amp breaker with 12gauge wire for one s19 to maintain the ‘80% rule’ (only use 80% of what your outlet/wires are rated for) 


3.) Have you thought about noise and heat? An S19 sounds like a blender and vacuum cleaner are trying to have a baby all while dumping massive amounts of heat into your home. If you’re okay with a constant screaming noise you can probably leave your mining rooms door open and use box fans to ventilate, but more than likely the noise will be too loud and you will want to figure out a way to vent heat outside.


4.) Have you carefully read your contact. Most have some clauses in there that say your electricity is capped at $60 or whatever price but only if you use it ‘within reason’ buying a S19 and being found to be using one may void your contact. 

5.) Mining sounds too good to be true and that’s because it is. There’s tons of little factors that can’t be calculated into your ROI (return on investment) My suggestion would be to buy an old S9 for a couple of hundred bucks. Learn how to run that and deal with that noise and heat and then get a S19.",ifq0y9z,vwdak3,/r/BitcoinMining/comments/vwdak3/electricity_capped_60mo_rigs_at_all_time_lows/ifq0y9z/,12,BitcoinMining,2022-07-11 13:56:16

AndrewAwakened,"I’ve spent a large chunk of my life living in the third world, and one thing MOST of them have in common is a failure to capitalize on opportunities like these which could be a leg up for their economies and people. 

One very common reason is that regardless of what political system exists on paper, they are all in effect run by powerful elites in government, business, and in some cases the military. These  groups protect each other’s positions of power, and corruption, bribes and sweetheart deals are the norm. You could be a brilliant entrepreneur with the most amazing idea, but if your new business is too disruptive and threatens the prosperity of businesses owned by the big boys, they can rely on the government to put obstacles in your way to slow or limit you.

Hopefully that’s not the case in Paraguay though and it’s one of the exceptions!

Edit: I forgot to also mention that another big problem is typical taxation policy. Since these governments are usually strapped for cash and struggling to provide adequate services and infrastructure, whenever a new industry emerges the standard practice is to slap a hefty tax on it. Although there is obvious benefit in keeping the tax low so that the industry can flourish rapidly and generate more tax revenue over the long haul, this is a totally foreign concept to typical third world governments - probably because there is always a desperate need to increase tax revenue as much as they can, right now.",ig2dkam,vycgek,/r/BitcoinMining/comments/vycgek/how_bitcoin_mining_can_help_develop_a_country/ig2dkam/,2,BitcoinMining,2022-07-14 00:37:07

When I look back, I should have kept mining even if I was barely making any profits, probably the worst mistake of my life. At that point I did not understand the upside of DCA.

Glad I didn’t buy them at that point. That’s not to say that buying the older miners has been a trouble free experience either! But at least they’re paid for, so if I end up losing  money on the venture it’s money that I’ve already lost.

There’s a few options but seem to have lots of variables that end up changing the bottom line price. 

DCX seems to have been around doing this for smaller retail clients, and they have a system on sale now for $6k for up to 8 s19 miners. Includes fluid and 40kw drycooler. I’ve hear mix reviews about DCX, and in quick searching for YT vids or reviews from actual people with their systems, it’s hard to find much. 

I got a quote from Aiproenergy for their 2 of their Hotbox Liu systems, which holds 12 total s19. With the added 70kw drycooler, fluid, and engineering fees it is about $18k. This company is in its early stages, but seems high compared to DCX. 

I’ve contacted TMGcore for info and a quote, but it looks like their smallest option is for about 28 units, which is probably a bit much for me. I’ll add that info when I get it.

Stunning-Ask5916,"Yes, you can.

You can also do hosted mining. You buy the machine, the host installs it, then you pay them a monthly fee to keep it running.  You can pick a host with low electricity costs (electricity costs really matter). You won't have to worry about the details of diagnosing, repairing, or replacing bad electronics.

Your rate of return will likely drop over time, due to increasing difficulty; difficulty is a technical term.  You should understand it before jumping in.  The more machines there are, the fewer coins the average machine finds.  Also research the halving.

Finally, understand the types of machines. A liquid cooled machine is (barely?) out of your price range.  You can afford an S19 or two, depending if monthly maintenance is part of your $5-10k budget.

There are sites, such as asicminervalue, that will estimate profitability for you, though some people question their accuracy.",igimaaj,w1615c,/r/BitcoinMining/comments/w1615c/can_i_start_bitcoin_mining_with_a_5k_10k_budget/igimaaj/,7,BitcoinMining,2022-07-17 13:44:05

Harry-Ali,"Great! Welcome to the field,

Bitcoin mining requires you have ASIC that are designed for SHA256 algorithm. You only need a computer when you configure the ASIC with pool information, once before you change the configuration. So you should not worry about it.

Here are our articles about getting started in mining, [https://f2pool.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/sections/4403738130189-Glossary](https://f2pool.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/sections/4403738130189-Glossary). Hope this help.

Before you start mining,  you should have a ASIC, pool account, a bitcoin wallet. There are some others, but they are easiy to find or handle. 

Let me know if you need any help.",igr35cw,w1615c,/r/BitcoinMining/comments/w1615c/can_i_start_bitcoin_mining_with_a_5k_10k_budget/igr35cw/,1,BitcoinMining,2022-07-19 08:02:26

Plus, why not just invest in one of the ""quiet generators"" and build a HHO Generator Setups (As found on YouTube) to provide the fuel for the ""quiet generator""? 

I have tow other ideas, but we'll see - noone seems to like them or believe they work.  Not even my brother.  But this HHO idea - it's gotta work - or crypto is dieing.

I'd hate to say it, but it was me that introduced ASIC to crypto and asked them if they could build an ASIC to mine the Blockchain.  I just sent them an email the other day to find out if I can help sell Asics.  Well see what happens with that!  Electricity, HHO and Quiet Generators are my best bet, but not my only bet!

Stunning-Ask5916,"At $0.23, pass.

Some have mentioned heat.  That can be a mitigating factor.  Vent the air outside in summer and keep it inside in winter. So while your gross electrical cost is high, the effective cost in winter is less.  That is, you may pay $450 more per month for electricity but $150 per month less for heating.

That's probably not enough to overcome that $0.23 electricity cost, but deserves to be considered when doing the math.",ih53nmd,w4njgq,/r/BitcoinMining/comments/w4njgq/newb_considering_single_btc_miner_in_basement/ih53nmd/,2,BitcoinMining,2022-07-22 03:06:27

hippography,"I know I'm late replying but just adding some info about why it's been ""soon"" for so long, at least speaking for Braiins. MicroBT uses at least 3 different SoC's (system-on-a-chip) in their control boards for each hardware model (h3, h6, h6os) seemingly at random, as well as multiple PSU variations and other components, all of which impact the firmware. Since these variations are fairly random across batches, we have to work with partner mining companies to discover which variations exist in the first place, then engineer support for each of them. So we have had certain SoC / control board &amp; PSU combinations supported for over 1 year, and others we are still learning about. 

The goal is to have a user experience of just downloading a single firmware image that works for every possible variation and auto-detects each of these component types to run the appropriate version of the firmware. But essentially we are developing over a dozen different versions of the firmware for just one hardware model, e.g. the M20S. No standardization or public documentation at all from these hardware manufacturers. 

The goal is still M20S &amp; M30S support by EOY, with M20S coming sooner.

jtoomim,"Don't.

Happiness and economic utility is roughly proportional to log(wealth). This means that losses of money have a larger effect on your happiness than gains. If you gamble on Bitcoin or Bitcoin mining with a loan, you amplify the downside tremendously. If Bitcoin drops in price by 3x again (like it did over the last 8 months), then your miners will be unable to pay for the electricity it costs to run them and their resale value will drop by about 10x, and you will suddenly be around $80k in debt.

If you're married, this could end not just in poverty, but in divorce.

Do not gamble with borrowed money.

You cannot discharge your battery to 0%, the BMS will shut it off at 10% or higher. If you have a few days without solar, your battery will still discharge (don't forget inverters use a few 100 Watts during the rainy day, even when idle).

An ASIC is a tool.  It nearly “locks in” your cost to accumulate BTC; difficulty adjusts it slightly.  You can keep mining as the price goes up.

KWJOHNSON140,"Not a crapshoot, but a lottery.

If you are looking at a reseller, look up what other people experienced buying used miners from them.
In my experience, American or European resellers are better, the Chinese guys often send something that looks like it was running in a dust storm and dropped on the ground. 

Ebay is a great option because you can buy individual miners from individual people. This way you can see the exact unit you are getting,  and you can ask questions about that one specifically. Plus there is purchase protection if they lie.

If you are comfortable taking apart and deep cleaning miners, the Chinese resellers often have the best prices. 

Basically it depends on your risk tolerance and ability to fix your hardware. If you have extra cash and you are comfortable disassembling a miner, used miners are awesome!
If you want something that is guaranteed to work well on arrival, try to find an individual seller and get pictures of the actual unit they intend to give you. (Like I said before, ebay is great if you don't mind watching and waiting for a deal).",ihux9n7,w9ed18,/r/BitcoinMining/comments/w9ed18/is_buying_a_used_miner_a_crapshoot/ihux9n7/,2,BitcoinMining,2022-07-27 14:53:03

Nothing shows that it was shipped only that a label was created. Support says maybe carrier lost it. So it looks like they lost my miner and are trying to blame the carrier they selected to avoid responsibility. Even if I get it back it will be at least 2 months downtime for their warranty.

You create a NEW outlet for these miners.  You need a double pole breaker so you’re pulling 240V.  One single exception is to take over the outlet for a clothes dryer, that would possibly be the only outlet in your home you could safely modify to support a miner.

tweak722,"All investors calculate ROI. Anything else would be irresponsible. It’s just that mining involves factors that can’t be dealt with in the same way as a building or an industrial machine. This will typically be seen as risk, which is why mining itself is considered a risky investment. Which is fine for a lot of people who has money to risk. The risk may be somewhat less than just buying Bitcoin, as your gear brings profit down to BTC = 8000 in best cases, and keep residual value based on assumptions from people like OP.

I always try to denominate my mining investments in BTC. How much BTC it costs to buy a miner, how long it will take to mine that BTC back, minus electrify costs etc and then estimate what residual value the miner will have in BTC.

OldLatinGuy,"This is close but, IMHO, there's a another, perhaps more useful, approach utilising ""traditional finance"" terms.

Crypto miners (of whatever sort) are very like foreign currency bonds. The purchase price can be equated to the face value of the bond in its native currency, the bond (or miner) yields some return (a dividend) that remains relatively constant over the medium term. 

For miners/bonds denominated in BTC that dividend is influenced by more factors than a traditional bond, but those factors are all quantifiable and therefore subject to realistic modeling. 

Regardless of the external factors (cost of electricity, fiat conversion rate, etc.) the miner (or bond) will continue to generate its dividend at a predictable rate in its native currency over time, just as a traditional bond does. 

Obviously, the value in some local fiat will change, sometimes enormously (as we've seen in the current ""bear market""). For a mining operation with goal of creating BTC and converting to local fiat, the conversion rate and operating costs are crucial to its very existence. For an individual or other operator principally interested in accumulation (i.e. ""stacking sats"") for future gains in local purchasing power (be it in BTC itself or local fiat), the equation is significantly different.

As a bond investor, I want to know that my purchase is able to generate real income in excess of inflation, continuously, and with acceptable risk, over a period of time, typically in the 3 to 10 year range.

As a small BTC miner I want to have reliable hardware that will generate a predictable number of sats over a similar time frame. We're about 2 years from the next halving, geo-political risk is high in either direction: what happens if Russia is cut off from the global internet as part of the Ukraine sanctions? What if Russia decides to use tactical nukes in Ukraine? In Europe and the USA inflation is high but not even close to ""living memory"" levels and some costs are rather quickly decreasing. 

So we mine sats and accumulate at a predictable (the original ""bond's"" coupon rate). And because  we believe that BTC is and will be a ""store of value"" relative our local fiat we keep on stacking.",iiaogr7,wbrxf6,/r/BitcoinMining/comments/wbrxf6/why_roi_is_a_misplaced_concept_for_purchasing_an/iiaogr7/,3,BitcoinMining,2022-07-30 20:03:31

Anyone who promises immediate returns, whether with crypto or fiat or whatever, is full of it. No one in life is gonna just hand out money. If you’re really strapped for cash mining is not for you. You can try your hand with investing in crypto as the prices are low and with ETH 2.0 on the way.

CryptoDApper,"The problem is not setting up the pool but getting enough hashrate for daily reward payout, which means you need to find at least one block every day regularly. If you dont have daily payouts (or even weekly) ppl will be reluctant to move their miners to your pool even at 0% fees. If you have your own bitcoin mining operation first then you can setup a public pool once you get to a large enough hashrate for daily reward payout, with todays difficulty that means approx. 1,400 PH/s to regularly find a single block daily which is what approx. 10,000 140TH/s Antminer S19 XP can do. If you aim to find one block per week it still requires a lot of hashing power, approx. 190 PH/s which is what approx. 1,357 140 TH/s Antminer S19 XP can do.  Even if you aim to find just one block per month it still requires a lot of hashing power, approx. 45 PH/s which is what approx. 321 140TH/s Antminer S19 XP can do.",iiruk46,wf3oez,/r/BitcoinMining/comments/wf3oez/setting_up_a_mining_pool/iiruk46/,5,BitcoinMining,2022-08-03 12:24:09

Ensano,"buy miners as you scale and buy/max your infrastructure during bull markets.

IE when BTC goes to 120k it'll cost a lot less BTC to buy a 10k liquid immersion rig.  Then as you go fill it with miners.  Just make sure that the BTC cost of the miner is less than what you can realistically mine in BTC.  I think a lot of people get into this 4-5 year RIO for miners problem and they aren't thinking about it logically. There's halvings and risk you have to be rewarded for.  

If you're trying to sell me a miner for .25 BTC but it'll only mine .15 BTC in the next 2 years (upcoming halving) why the hell would I buy that.  I'll buy the .25 BTC and hold it until the bull market and use it to max my infrastructure.

10k liquid immersion cooling system costs .45 BTC today but in 2 years would only cost  0.083 (repeating, of course) BTC @ 120k/BTC so I might as well max out what I have now and during the next bull scale to the next level.

I have some guilt about it. I invested in a mine way back in 2012 just to help a friend who had recently come to the US, not expecting any return. I used my BTC for small dark web purchases and then proceeded to misplace the key. Lucky for me, I found it when I moved to California in 2016, just when BTC was marching towards its high in 2017 I basically cashed it all in. I was going to reinvest some of my profits but I was worried about how speculative BTC had become and it’s lack of utility (no markets would accept it anymore). Anyway, I told my story to friends, always emphasizing the sheer luck part, and I think it had alot to do with getting them into mining, the easy, interest free money available also played a part I’m sure. I have to admit I’m not a BTC enthusiast. I still have issues with its utility and now regulators are gonna be chomping at the bit. Use your head and make a rational decision.

jtoomim,"208/120 sucks. Don't do it.

Many PSUs that aren't rated for 277 can still work on 277. But some will blow up. YMMV. If you have a mix of machines, you could do 480Y/277V with the ones that are compatible and have a smaller step-down autotransformer for the stuff that isn't.

Most LED lighting systems are compatible with 100V-240V, and many are 100V-277V. LEDs use AC/DC converters, which gives them that tolerance over a wide voltage range. So you might not actually need much or any 120V power. You can also buy a couple of small (1.5 KVA) transformers with a 2:1 ratio to step down to 120V. Most commonly these transformers are rated for 480V-&gt;240V, but you can run that on 240V high-side input and get 120V out just as easily. If you'd like, you can add NEMA 5-15r/p connectors onto the ends to make connecting it to individual loads (or a power strip) easy.

If you need some line-neutral PDUs for 415V or 480V, feel free to reach out to me. I may have some surplus 22kW and 44kW (30A/60A @ 415V) PDUs in a week or two.",ijvmoud,wlv3wh,/r/BitcoinMining/comments/wlv3wh/208120_vs_415240_vs_480277/ijvmoud/,3,BitcoinMining,2022-08-11 16:51:52

MPD8811,"If over voltage is your biggest concern power transformers often have “taps”, to adjust the delivered service voltage. +/- 5%. So you may be able to get your nominal voltage down to ~450/250 at the transformer secondary. It’s not 240 but it’s closer. If you’re far away from the substation and the primary voltage comes in a bit low you could get lucky. Typically this goes the other way and the utility uses the tap to increase the voltage to a nominal 480/277 at the point of service. Works the same way the other direction.

The reason “close” might safely work is that AC/DC power supplies have an acceptable input range a bit higher and a bit lower than their specified range. Designers know for instance 240 is seldom exactly 240.

A final idea worth asking the utility about is if you find them a 415/240 transformer is that an option? It may be that the reason they won’t give you a 415/240 supply is that they don’t stock that transformer spec.",ijyegry,wlv3wh,/r/BitcoinMining/comments/wlv3wh/208120_vs_415240_vs_480277/ijyegry/,2,BitcoinMining,2022-08-12 04:35:39

almkvist,"Making a simplified calculation (which you have done) is quite easy and gets you a general idea of the potential revenue if all variables would be constant.   


Unfortunately, only your hashrate (and block reward if your calculation doesn't extend to 2 years) is semi-constant in the real world. This will with a long time span make your calculation differ from the real world data by A LOT.  


In order to get more accurate and less dependent on current variable values, I would suggest not having the potential $ return be the final output from your formula. I made a spreadsheet  that outputs return in BTC, since it's much easier to predict.   


The only last hard variable to predict is the future mining difficulty. Here it's up to you how you want to speculate. Generally, difficulty follows (with some delay) the mining profits. When mining profit increases (due to previously lowered difficulty, increased BTC price or lowered electricity prices), the difficulty will soon follow after, and vice versa.

Are you referring to the fact that most electricity generators are only about 30-60% efficient, resulting in 40-70% of the energy you supply them with being lost as heat? If so, the answer is no, you cannot run mining rigs off of that. Nor can you do much of anything with that heat except make things warmer. Low-grade waste heat cannot be used to do much of anything. Go read up on Carnot cycle efficiency limits.

Are you talking about natural gas that is flared at oil wells due to the lack of a pipeline at remote locations? Yes, Bitcoin mining can and frequently is done at such locations.

Xinqiu-,"The breakeven price for most machines is around 16-17K. The current price of BTC is around 22K.

In the past 2 months, many machines were below the breakeven price, that is, they were losing money even while mining. But there should be some improvement in recent weeks.The new gen of machines is usually with lower power consumption, so its break-even price is lower than the old generation ones.

Classic_Ad3154,"Try swapping the ribbon cables between working and non working hashboards. 
That would normally narrow down to prove if the problem is the hashboard or probably just the cable or the control board. Switching them up allows you do do a lot of troubleshooting of individual components. If it clearly boils down to the hashboard......pull that hashboard and do a thorough visual inspection.....
.smell it, check for black ash.......check for melted solder.

Hope this helps. I was forced to do the exact process recently.....was able to prove that two hashboards were the problem.......haven't been able to pull them just yet.....but the miner is on warranty so depending on the outcome; I'll have to ship it back to China at my cost and they would repair and pay the return shipping.

In general, for those reading and thinking about their own setups:
1. First line of defense is proper design. No Clark Griswold wiring methods.
2. Second, ensure you use quality electrical materials. Pay a little more for properly rated equipment if needed so it’ll work when you need it to.
3. Electricians for the most part are installers, not magicians. A licensed electrician can properly install electrical products but a proper installation doesn’t protect someone from themselves…. example… plugging in a miner cord rated for 10A into a machine that draws 14A and into a receptacle rated for 15A, protected by a 20A breaker that trips are 16A….

Openminer,"I suppose it depends on what your getting paid for the electric generated by the panels.  Solar is much more profitable if your installing them yourself.  You can buy used panels.  A whole pallet is around 2 grand and 99 percent of the time has mouse chews in the electric wire.  Simply cut it off replace the end.  I did my own but I was offsetting my power cost and 2.5 ROI is my cost.   Has he already calculated how much he'll make?  He contacted the electric company?  At current prices I'd almost pick solar over crypto right now.  My panels will last many years.  The price of electricity will go up not down. I pay way too much for electric though and spend nearly 300 a month for electric.  My crypto runs for free though.  I have a couple of businesses that require constant power or burst of power and honestly at this point buying batteries and storing it is still cheaper than buying.  
You might want to do the math for him.
3500 for a miner, plus electric is your profit for how long.  
3500 for my solar will pay 3 plus dollars a day. I can ramp that up but then start loosing some profit to batteries and have a maximum of 10 grand I can invest without having know what they'll pay me for excess electric.
We are missing a lot of information in your post though.  Retired? Pension or military income.  
One thing I'm curious about not has not been asked.  200 panels on the roof.  That's HUGE!!!  Is the house 8000 square feet?!?!  How many KW?
Anyhow ask him to sleep on it for a month.  Find others that have done this and ask them if they mind sharing details.

Unfair_Judgment2525,"With current energy crisis in europe and the government rewarding incentives (subsidy) running a solar farm seems very lucrative. 
2) Consuming the electricity by yourself instead of selling back to the grid also seems more lucrative as generally those energy companies will buy cheap.

I am with you, i plan to do the same. So i am biased in my reply to you.
A big difference though is the subsidy we can get in my country, it makes up 40% of the revenue (crazy!).

Please don't calculate in just panels, but also include the electrical infrastructure (inverter, cables, fuse, inspection, insurance, contract handling (lawyer), tax accountant, management software license, maintenance)

i like the concept of Tesla Powerwall forming a virtual powerplant. 
i also like the concept local2local (producing locally, consuming locally), cutting out the middle man (energy company).

So instead of investing in miners myself, why not setup a hosting business, where others invest in miners and you simply sell electricity more profitable then selling to the grid.

you have a choice to invest in battery and your ROI will dramatically be prolonged, or you sell back to the grid.
But usually there is a big price difference between selling and buying. For example in my country i sell for 0,09/kWh and buy for 0,35/kWh (residential tarif).
But i have the luck that still for 1 more year we can sell 1:1 the same price if we consume it ourselves later again.
So i plan on investing in batteries once the government gives some inventive for it next year.

ps: 200 panels is nothing, will not make much money.
not enough to live on passive income.

also there seems to be an energy market, you can register yourselves to it as a producer and sell for the highest bid, but getting connected to that is probably expensive (needs special equipment) and not worth it for 200 panels.",im4q654,wzhjig,/r/BitcoinMining/comments/wzhjig/father_putting_all_savings_into_solar_panels/im4q654/,2,BitcoinMining,2022-08-28 14:26:23

decentralized-cloud,"Texas seems to be having a lot of power problems lately. Not sure I would want to take the gamble to setup shop there with hot weather, curtailment periods, spiking electric prices, etc.

You could always try Sunbreak Electronics datacenter in Oregon. There is a wholesale hosting package that is effectively 7.5 cents ""all-in"". The utility is 5 cents and you get your own meter and dedicated power panel for your racks and sign up with and pay the utility direct. 

Paying for power direct to the utility is a nice perk, you only pay for the power you use. Plus unlike Texas, uptime is &gt;99.9%.

Prestigious_Fan_9183,"To compensate for this, Bitcoin’s mining difficulty adjusts every 2016 blocks (approximately every two weeks), to adapt to the rise and fall of the hash rate, ensuring that the average block is produced once every 10 minutes. As such, Bitcoin’s mining difficulty tends to follow its hash rate. 

Hash rate has been turbulent since May, during which the Terra fallout and macroeconomic pressures pushed Bitcoin’s price down to the lowest point since late 2020. When Bitcoin’s price falls, so does the value of the coins that miners produce. 

Since June, hash rate retraced from an all-time high of 253 EH/s to only 170 EH/s at the beginning of August. Miners were forced to sell massive portions of their Bitcoin positions to cover their costs in the meantime. 

However, the trend appears to be reversing somewhat, with hash rate back up to 224 EH/s as of August 29th, according to Blockchain.com.",imjvmru,x27fej,/r/BitcoinMining/comments/x27fej/bitcoin_mining_difficulty_rose_9_and_average/imjvmru/,1,BitcoinMining,2022-08-31 18:04:20

Once you have verified you have the outlets setup you need to setup and ethernet hotspot or some way to get ethernet with your power.

Then you need to buy a miner which is going to cost atleast 1000 and if you want one that will last awhile you will need to spend a few thousand.

OhTheFuture,"If you choose ducting you MUST use a minimum of 8""; otherwise, you choke it.  Also, the ducting needs something to connect to both on the miner and wherever it's blowing out of.  Ducting can be a mega headache, though, and in theory sounds great but once it's in front of you you have a lot of work to do.   


Having said that, I use ducting(8"" +) but I also use with the ""hot aisle"" setup. So imo start with the hot aisle/cold aisle system and work from there.   


If noise is any kind of factor for your location, ducting can help keep the noise down if you do it right. These ASICS are louder than you think.

Also even though the price has gone down the hash rate continues to go up so I get less and less. Not to mention the outages that bring my machine down all the time.

vAaEpSoTrHwEaTvIeC,"Nobody's going to lay all of this (or even half) out for you on-demand, on reddit.  Even if they did, they're answering from a perspective that is different than yours (funding, know-how, electricity cost, btc knowledge base, opinions on future of btc, of mining, etc) ... so many pinches of salt, that there is no objective ""good advice""

So since you shouldn't trust strangers on the internet... where can you get your bearings?  I think the best you can be given is ""DYOR"" 

- get on youtube.  start by watching BITCOIN ONLY mining videos.   
- start with VoskCoin, he's accessible, and he is mostly a common sense dude, who runs ASICs in his garage.  That's an application-specific integrated circuit.  
- click on some algo-feed videos in the column on the right of the page.  make some subscriptions.  
- start watching major amounts of youtube  
- then start digging into reddit.  every question you've asked gets answered weekly, or at least monthly, here  


That should keep you busy for 3-5 weeks.  Your opinions and insights will be much sharper by then.

AndrewAwakened,The problem is bitcoin miners are ridiculously loud (like a high pitched vacuum cleaner running on full blast all the time) and generate a lot of heat (can take a small room from 75F to 90F in about an hour). And as you already know they draw a lot of power - anything worth running nowadays within your budget will start at about 1300 watts (Antminer S9) and go up from there. So depending on the layout of your office space you’re going to need to make or buy an enclosure to silence it and put in exhaust venting to dump all that heat to the outdoors.,ind8ngh,x7kg1p,/r/BitcoinMining/comments/x7kg1p/electric_bill_included_in_office_rent_budget/ind8ngh/,2,BitcoinMining,2022-09-06 21:25:56
BlackFlagMiner,"With an S19J Pro miner running air cooled you’re gonna need exhaust fans wherever you’re mining, for simplicity’s sake we’ll say you have 1 running at 100 watts. S19J Pro uses ~3070 watts and hashes at 104 TH/s. At a 10 c/kWh rate using 3170 watts and paying a 2.5% pool fee you’d be making about 50 cents/day. And difficulty raises every day. Losing profitability daily. If price went up to 60K tomorrow with no difficulty change you’d be making $18/day but that won’t be the case(most likely). 

Assuming you want to run immersion you’d probably be paying $1.5k-$2k for the system and would be using ~200 watts to run the radiator fan and pump on it. Let’s say since it’s immersed you overclock it 50% on custom firmware to run at 155TH/s on 4650watts. Bring that down to ~150TH/s to account for 3% dev fee on custom firmware so 150TH/s, 4650 watts. So now accounting for system power + miner power - pool fee you’d still be making only ~53 cents/day due to more power being used. If bitcoin went up to 60k tomorrow with an immersion setup overclocked as stated above you’d be earning ~$25.30/day. It’s a balancing act and with residential power bitcoin mining just isn’t worth it at a residential power rate. 

Edit, forgot to subtract 120watts for removal of miner fans in an immersion setup, which I haven’t done the math for but would probably bring you back up to 55-57 cents/day.",indfhh8,x7eupf,/r/BitcoinMining/comments/x7eupf/things_to_consider_before_buying_a_s19_pro/indfhh8/,2,BitcoinMining,2022-09-06 22:12:27

The building will notice within a few months if you're using way more than expected.

Even several kW of always on extra power usage in a small office will be noticeable.

LettersKenny,"Depends on what a “lot of power” means and what your budget for building substations are. 

Substations will run a few million to build and take 12-18 months without getting stupidly lucky on sourcing high voltage transformers in stock. Allows you to take voltages over 69kv and provides the lowest power cost. 

Presumably you’re looking at distribution voltages (69kv and less). 

Distribution sites: we have a 10, 30, and 60mw. 

Transmission sites: 90, 150, 500mw.

SailsAk,If you want to be extra safe get some copper grounding wife and wrap it around a screw that will fit into where you took the original screw out. I use what we call “sharpie” screws. Then wherever your closest outlet is kill the breaker. Take the outlet out wire nut your grounding wire to the green grounding wire in the outlet and put everything back the way it was before.

didymus_1,"Dear Compass Miner,

We are writing to inform 1 you that our Ontario 1 facility partner, Red Jar, notified us this afternoon that they will be temporarily suspending operations this evening Wednesday, September 14 at 8 pm EST due to a rise in their variable power rates.

While Compass Mining retains fixed rate costs with all hosting providers--and prepays for monthly hosting allocations-large hosting providers often maintain variable rates with exposure to spot energy markets.

More granularly, Ontario 1's utility provider uses a mix of nuclear, solar, natural gas and hydroelectric power. However, an unusually dry season has led to less abundant hydro and therefore an increased dependency on yet another stressed energy source, natural gas. Red Jar believes Ontario 1 operations can continue once variable rates decrease, which markets are already beginning to see.

Compass Mining is working to come to an agreement with Red Jar to get clients' machines back online. We will do everything in our power to do what's best for our clients.

We do not have an expected timeline for the facility to go back online and apologize for the sudden nature of the service interruption. Compass Mining clients will receive frequent updates by email as conversations progress.

Compass Miners will not be billed for downtime. Future invoices will be paused until the issue is resolved.

As always, the Compass Mining team remains available for questions by submitting a ticket to our team.",iojc3f0,xexn6o,/r/BitcoinMining/comments/xexn6o/compassmining_ontario_site_loss/iojc3f0/,4,BitcoinMining,2022-09-15 14:46:23

coolshoeshine,"I looked in to this very seriously in about 2020, really glad I did not do it

I actually bought 5 acres too, just never placed the panels

The tldr: completely off-grid is not yet feasible to actually turn a profit, batteries just aren't there yet

You can buy enough panels to run your miners during the day, no problem, but really there's only like 6 hours a day (on average).

If you want to run the miners all day, you will need batteries, which are much much more expensive than the panels themselves, and will die and need to be replaced after a couple years.

If you have no batteries and just mine while the sun is shining, then you are only getting 1/4 of the time and income (6/24 hours).  This means that miner with an ROI of 1 year is now actually 4 years.  And for all we know the next generation btc miners will be out in 4 years, so now you have to replace all your miners to be profitable.

If you are connected to the grid then you can use the grid as a giant battery basically, so that's more feasible.

I've been waiting for this new type of battery from Ambri.  It's meant to be a lot cheaper than Li ion batteries... fingers crossed... cus I still want to do it one day lol",ioxdqrr,xhfclf,/r/BitcoinMining/comments/xhfclf/whos_started_a_from_scratch_solar_maiming_farm/ioxdqrr/,5,BitcoinMining,2022-09-18 13:53:09

Bitmain XP Hydro is currently a futures contract. The way it works is, there is a “price” for placing your deposit, and your second installment. The REAL price is when the futures is delivered, according to market price, but the futures contract price caps the delivery spot.

For example, S19Pro Hydro futures was $78 / TH, the first batch that came to market was $51 / TH.

So we don’t know how much those machines would be when they come out in a bit.

bitcornminerguy,"I’ve spent quite a bit of time looking into solar for mining as well. My short-term answer is that the solar winds up being a hedge against your actual energy costs. Going 100% solar seems very difficult, especially if your mining farm is of any scale.

Working on an interesting experiment, though, doing a grid-tied thing with a few used solar panels. Used panels can sometimes come with a very deep discount for one reason or another, and can pull the cost way down. Obviously need to be sure you’re getting functional panels, etc. but people replace them for a variety of reasons and usually their “loss” is your gain. 

My brother is a bit more up on solar tech than me, and part of our experiment involves mixing panels, so when I know more and we actually get it to function, I’ll come report how its going.",ip2tmk0,xhfclf,/r/BitcoinMining/comments/xhfclf/whos_started_a_from_scratch_solar_maiming_farm/ip2tmk0/,3,BitcoinMining,2022-09-19 15:56:03

throwawaymdd7,"I speak for The Solar Farm. We had a disastrous first two months because of technical issues with our containers. We finally got them worked out. At the same time we had a staffing crisis where the company was down to just me and the sales guy handling all the emails, calls, texts, and attempting to get the technical issues worked through. We were overwhelmed and you got bad service as a result. I am sincerely very sorry. We don't expect to be paid for this, you can't say we've hounded you for money because we know you haven't received service.

But we've hired a miner technician with decades of support who has almost cleared out the backlog of technical support issues. It should be pointed out that the vast majority of these were not Solar Farm issues, they were misconfigured miners that we had to straighten out for our clients. We're happy to do it, but it's not like we were failing constantly. Almost all of our customers are now hashing 24/7. I'm going to DM you his email address so he can get you working. But I'll give you his direct email, he'll get you hashing.

We're a small business that has been a small+ sized business for 3 months. We've been hosting over a year but the containers are new. We got bad equipment and had to work through it and replace the network. The switches were faulty. We have not charged anyone for anything they haven't received and if we did it by accident, we refunded the amount. We've finally got the kinks worked out. The network is stable, customers are hashing. We failed OP by falling out of communications, but we will correct that. We're in it to help the small miner. We have an MOQ of 1, even though that's less profitable than only taking large farms. We take all miners, even A4s and Z15s even though they're a lot less profitable than S19s. We do that because we started as miners and we want to help miners. It disappoints us terribly that we have disappointed a large number of our clients in those early days.

jtoomim,"If you're lucky, the machine will simply refuse to run, as the control systems are likely incompatible. If your luck is average, it will destroy the S19 and nothing else. If you're unlucky, it will start a fire and destroy your house.

An S19 typically runs at 13.8 V. Power draw is proportional to voltage squared, so if it were to run at 19.5 V (the proportional point in the APW11's voltage range), it would use 94% more power than it should and (intially) generate 94% more heat than it was designed for. This would probably destroy your hashboards, and would likely cause them to fail in a catastrophic manner (i.e. chip thermal runaway). That, in turn, could cause a short circuit and/or start a fire.

decentralized-cloud,"Do not rewire your genset for single phase. It's not as efficient for the generator and if you have to run any fans they are more efficient running from three phase as well. There are no miners that run on three phase. Each phase of a three phase supply is a single phase; A to B, B to C and C to A. You mentioned your generator is 36 kW. You could safely run 9 x S19's @ 3300 watts each and use 30 kW and have just enough margin to run your fan. Do not run your generator at 100%. Most of the time they are only rated for 80% continuous use.

Also, skip the PDU. Modern miners require a full 20 amp circuit at 208 vac. For only 9 machines it's far easier just to use a breaker panel (you'll need one anyways) and run dedicated 20a double pole breakers to each machine.

You'll also likely need to stagger the startup of the miners as the load suddenly increasing to 80% might drop voltage momentarily enough they reset only to reset again once they initialize and the load kicks in again, over and over.

What is your fuel source? Because diesel, gasoline or propane wouldn't be profitable. Plus you will need to shut your generator down every 200 hours for an oil change, new air and oil filter, etc. In all but a few select cases involving stranded natural gas or running on filtered and centrifuged used vegetable oil genset life and crypto don't mix.",ir25drh,xv3vyx,/r/BitcoinMining/comments/xv3vyx/looking_for_competent_electrician/ir25drh/,2,BitcoinMining,2022-10-04 19:52:50

cookmanager,"Back of the napkin calculation:

• Buying bitcoin outright gives you 0.4 bitcoin for the cost of a 141T

• A 141T @ $8,100 @ 10¢ produces about 0.07 bitcoin if hashrate growth matches bitcoin growth, requiring a 650% outperformance of bitcoin to hashrate to break even with buying outright (e.g. if hashrate goes up 40% per year, bitcoin must go up 710% per year and at that point you would have 0.4 bitcoin after running for many years)

• A 110T @$4,300 @ 8¢ also is less than outright bitcoin purchase, and requires outperformance of bitcoin of only 250% per year

So definitely the 110T, if you like risking bitcoin you could have today for future bitcoin performance…back of the napkin, of course",irgw8hf,xy50io,/r/BitcoinMining/comments/xy50io/which_would_you_pick/irgw8hf/,7,BitcoinMining,2022-10-08 01:04:10

Weary_Surprise_6593,"Most hacks happen when you are trying to remote into your machines. To log into a machine from another device on another network, you need to have access to the internal network your miner is on. This is usually prevented by a firewall (aka your router), so you have to manually set up a way to bypass the firewall and tell your router that any device coming through this port is OK. If you don’t set this up correctly, you give hackers a backdoor into your network and they basically bypass the firewall (posing as you). Hackers can get access to every machine on that network and any passwords you type in are exposed over the internet (on a certain port) unencrypted, especially with these asic miners. 

Long story short, don’t set this up if you don’t know what your are doing. Usually chrome Remote Desktop or team viewer are safer ways to remote in, but require a computer turned on and connected at all times to the network (i.e., running 24/7). I personally don’t recommend either and just recommend using a pool that notifies you when your miners disconnect, so you can manually restart them.",irutnqb,y0y1l9,/r/BitcoinMining/comments/y0y1l9/avoid_being_hacked/irutnqb/,2,BitcoinMining,2022-10-11 05:11:04

sos755,"Fundamentally, mining is just the process of updating the Bitcoin ledger (the ""block chain"").

Since everyone has a copy of the block chain, updating it must be done in a way that ensures that everyone has the same copy. This is done by having a competition for the privilege of making the next update {adding a ""block""). Without going into to much detail, the competition is like a lottery, and a hash is a lottery ticket. Miners will generate as many hashes as possible until a winning hash is found. Then, the winning miner will share their block and the competition will begin for the next block.

The prize for winning is called the ""block reward"". The block reward consists of fees paid by the transactions in the block plus the ""subsidy"", which is a fixed amount of new bitcoins that is cut in half every 4 years.",issqdft,y72q3d,/r/BitcoinMining/comments/y72q3d/question_what_is_the_goal_of_bitcoin_mining/issqdft/,1,BitcoinMining,2022-10-18 13:00:48

JadeAug,"The term ""mining"" is misleading and I wish it never became popular. I understand your confusion here.

   
Since bitcoin is an open ledger, how do you make sure everyone stays honest and doesn't try to overwrite transactions with their own data?  Imagine just a notebook with everyone's IOUs sitting in the middle of the town square.  Proof of Work is the answer, and is the actual innovation that bitcoin brought to the world.  

In order for a block of transactions to be closed and time stamped, computers on the network run a SHA 256 hashing function to try to find a random number that when that found number is input to a hashing function the output matches the desired outcome per the mining difficult. This is computational work that must be performing in the physical realm, that links the digital world with reality.  

Using the notebook analogy, imagine having a crowd of people needing to run circles around that notebook in order to randomly receive a pen worth 6.25btc every 10 minutes and this is the only pen that can be used to write new transactions in the ledger. People have to put in this work by running around in a circle for 10 minutes if they want a chance to get the pen. 

So if you don't win the pen is your work wasted? The answer is no, because there was a massive group of people running around in circles around your ledger, and no outsiders  were able to get in with their own ""fake pen"" to write their own transactions in the notebook. Because you participated in the circle pit with millions of other people, everyones IOU's are still in the public ledger and are safe. 

To put it simply, the goal of mining is to keep the network secure and honest. Miners are rewarded for their service through block rewards and transaction fees. The product is the worlds largest computational network used for transacting value information with 99.9% historical uptime that anyone can participate in.",istdi98,y72q3d,/r/BitcoinMining/comments/y72q3d/question_what_is_the_goal_of_bitcoin_mining/istdi98/,1,BitcoinMining,2022-10-18 15:46:37

The s19j pro 100t prices have dropped significantly. Right now I can get them for $2400 including shipping and duties. I think this would be a good miner to use for the commune.

Each member would need to contribute:

    $2400 per miner 
    
    Deposit of first and last month’s hosting fee (I’m calculating using 3100 
    watts as these run a little higher than advertised) $181.04 x 2 = 362.08 
    
    $100 setup fee per miner 
    
    Monthly hosting $181.04 per miner 

1 year contract

We will be using [LincoinPool](https://pool.lincoinpool.com/user/login?referrer=09dd0dcb-c245-48da-8f03-03d51e79537c) as they make it super easy to split payouts among multiple wallets by percentage. Watcher links will be provided to members so that they can monitor the commune's miners.

btcoins,"Honestly you need to know ppl or start your own. There’s lots to learn. Start small and learn as you go is the best. 

Once your mining farm is set up properly, there’s barely any work to be done. Most of my customers call me for basic maintenance (air dusting the miners that keep crashing) like once a month. I don’t mind doing it because I’m very quick and efficient. A 600kw farm for example requires maybe 5h of maintenance if it’s built properly.


On another note, fuck data center skills and stuff. Yea they’re good at cable management but if it works and no one goes in there it don’t need to be fixed or even be presentable. As long as airflow is good you’re in the clear.


A mining farm requires a fraction of the investment to run an actual data centre. If you have a power outage it’s no biggie, your miners will just be offline for a couple of hours. Servers being down is a pretty big deal.


Most technician data centre jobs are crap, most mining farms don’t require lots of employees. Most of the exp you need you will get by doing it yourself.

SomeCuriousFellow,"A few years ago, I rented out some space in a warehouse that was manly used for cannabis growing. It's was beneficial for me and them since they would supply me with cheap electricity and I would provide them with heating throughout the colder seasons.

Since the warehouse was located in Quebec, half the year was too cold to grow and heating was a waste of money for them, so this was a beneficial set up for both of us.

However, you must keep an eye on a few things.

#1 - Dust &amp; Bugs
When growing any kind of plants, dust may be an issue if the soil that is being used is relatively dry. When working with plants, soil dust can kick up and go into your machines, you will need some kind of filtration system.

If you are pulling air from outside, be sure to use some kind of air filters to prevent dust and bugs from coming into the building. Spider mites are common issues when growing indoors, so be observant when doing your cleaning. If you see bugs, let the others guys know cause it can effect their crops as well.

#2 - Humidity
Humidity will kill your machines if you don't keep an eye on it. I've seen metal fan shrouds become all rusted up because of it. And when you really done want is condensation acculturating in the room. Since ether machines are generating dry heat, this shouldn't be an issue. Just place a temperature and humidity monitor in the room to keep an eye on things. As long as you between 35-50% humidity you should be fine.

#3 - Heat Management
Depending on the type of growing lights they are using, they may not want additional heating throughout summer. In which case, you'll need to prepare for exhausting your heat outside instead of to their growing area.

#4 - Separate Network
If you are using their internet for mining, be sure to set up your own firewall and place your mining behind your firewall. The last thing you want is you miners to get hacked, or for other user on the network to see those machines. After all, you are ""printing"" money.

Purchased one miner back in July and had it hosted for about 2 months. ( I was surprised this was possible)

Then they terminated the contract in October and left me with two options: (1) purchase an additional 20 miners to meet their *new* MOQ or (2) have the miner shipped to my home. Both at which are not feasible solutions for me.

welton_rs,"If it’s just an experiment you can do some quick math to make it easier on you. S9’s use ROUGHLY 1400 watts each. 110v space heaters use 1500 watts, so for the sake of argument I’m going to call them equals. Each space heater or each miner produces ROUGHLY 5000 BTUs. The general rule of thumbs is you need 20 BTUs for every square foot you want to heat (assuming 8 foot ceilings). So if you have a 1,500 square foot house you’ll need 30,000 BTUs. This translates into 6 heaters or 6 S9’s. The benefit a of actual space heaters is the built in thermostat but with the miners you’ll have to experiment with open windows and doors to make the house comfortable. Assuming you have insulated walls, the heat will continue building as long as the miners are on and I can tell you from experience that the heat in the house will be unbearable if you don’t have some ventilation",iujuv4w,yio60r,/r/BitcoinMining/comments/yio60r/iso_some_cheap_asics_that_will_run_off_110v_most/iujuv4w/,4,BitcoinMining,2022-10-31 21:44:44

I know that is true but honestly since you are planning to do a small residential farm I would say; if you can pay for the electricity without selling bitcoin every month its still worth it. I pay around 0.07US$/kWh and here is the breakdown of revenue and expenses for every S19 Pro;

Revenue
Approx. 0.0004btc/day = 0.012btc/month = 246$/month (btc @ 20,500$)

Expenses
170$ / month for electricity (@0.07$/kWh)

So you would still be making around 76$/month/machine

Obviously you would need to substract expenses for your setup and electrical materials but I work in construction and manage to get all the work done myself. Its a little side hobby, it aint much but its honest work! 

I just fit my electricity bill in my budget so I dont need to sell anything. Its basically letting me DCA for cheaper through my electricital bill.

ALWAYS calculate your profit AND costs in BTC not in USD! 

currently an S19 will cost you approx 0,2-0,3 BTC.

WhiteDogNC,"Solar and mining is a messy fit.  Here is why:

Five hours roughly of peak sun.  Four hours of weak sun.  This gives you 95% efficiency for approx 30% of 24 hours.  The other 70% of a day needs to generate electricity and store it for nighttime.  That means expensive batteries.  

240 watts panels are fairly standard so you will need about 13-14 panels to get the ~3,250 watts per hour needed for a BTC ASIC.  For the non-sunlight time you’ll need another 36 panels generating electricity for battery storage.  50 panels multiplied by 240 watts is 12,000 watts per hour multiplied by ~7 hours is a total electric generation of 84,000 watts.  

A solar system this large is wicked expensive, and the battery bank is too.  All for one Bitcoin miner.",iwama0z,yufc0b,/r/BitcoinMining/comments/yufc0b/would_it_be_more_profitable_to_mine_bitcoin_with/iwama0z/,5,BitcoinMining,2022-11-14 05:15:24

ndgoLiberty,"You can’t just pretend power is free. Even if it is somehow free, for you, you’re totally screwing someone else over by using the (to a normie) outrageous amount of energy it takes to mine bitcoin, that someone somewhere is paying for.

Bitcoin miners (other than the S9 which is very old and incredibly not profitable) use way more power than any standard wall outlet I know of can provide.

The real miners cost between $1500 an $6000 and to make that money back they suck back 3kW+ every hour on the hour for the entirety of their life.

This isn’t a game, this isn’t gambling, It’s one of the most competitive industries in the world and I promise you there are no loopholes that let you win. 

Now if you’re serious.

1. find out what your power rate is. If it’s under 0.06USD/kWh then you’ve got a chance.
2. Have an electrician install a 240V 30A plug in your house.
3. Go get $2500 and buy yourself an S19J Pro
4. Mine 24/7/365 at 75 decibels until somebody tells you to stop.

Accomplished-Mall331,"If you buy the latest Bitmain Antminer bitcoin ASIC then it will typically pay its self off within 1 year then it’s pure profit after that. But with the current market conditions it might take longer depending which way the market goes. Either way you will end up with more bitcoin mining it than if you were to buy bitcoin direct.

Example: $15k currently = 0.928867 Bitcoin right now. To make this easier let’s say that $15k = 1 Bitcoin

Option 1: You buy Bitcoin direct and you get 1 Bitcoin. After 1 year you still have only 1 Bitcoin. And after 2 years from now you will still only have 1 Bitcoin despite its value…and so on. You’ll only ever have 1 bitcoin obviously.

Option 2: You buy $15k worth of Bitcoin ASIC miners. After 1 year you’ll have made your money back and assuming Bitcoin price hasn’t changed you will have earned 1 Bitcoin profit (after electric costs, etc..). And after 2 years you will have 2 Bitcoins, after 3 years you’ll have earned 3 bitcoin, and so on. 

This is only a small example without factoring in future changes in the market, mining difficulty, and Bitcoin halving that occurs every 4 years. In a perfect world that’s exactly how it would go if you decided to mine bitcoin. But there’s many other factors like how much you pay for your Bitcoin miners that will determine your length of ROI and profits.

But the bottom line is YES 100% you would end up with more bitcoin if you opted to mine bitcoin instead of buying bitcoin outright. 

We need to talk about your electricity price though. $0.15 per kW is way to high to mine on profitably when the price of bitcoin is under $25k. Because Bitcoin miners are so powerful now of days you would need to be around $0.09kW or lower, $0.08kW is the current competitive price. The other thing is if your trying to mine at your residential house then you would only be able to setup 2 or 3 Bitcoin miners, anymore than that and you’ll blow all the fuses in your house. There’s a solution to both of these issues (high power cost + not enough power) and the solution is sending your miners to a Crypto Mining Hosting Farm. Hosting farms offer an extremely low electric rate and they also provide enough power to run 1000s of miners.

I’m a partner and actually manage a very large crypto mining hosting farm.

Secondly, the noise is greater than you think.......way greater. I started of with one 85th ASIC in a farm that I designed for a first stage of up to 2,000th based on external fans CFM......10 ASICS based on first stage electricy design with capacity to add up to 30 more ASICS. 

HOWEVER, from the starting blocks; noise became an issue.......and each time you control noise.....HEAT INCREASES!

After various noise boxes; the Mine is now able to run just about 7 ASICS (approx. 600th) and I'll have to basically build out a completely new farm with the noise and heat management factors that I've learnt by trial and error in order to continue onward toward 20 to 30 ASICS .

I'd say this as a rule of thumb;

Once you get noise under control......depending on your climate; you'll need air exchange capacity of 3X to 4X CFM of what each machine is rated for........which by the way....THIS ADDS EVEN MORE ""NOISE"".

It's a great journey.
And once you stick with it; you'd gain a ton of experience. 
Today I'm building an independent air box for one more ASICS as the existing system that originally should have handled 10 to 12 miners just cannot handle another one.

I if where you i would stick to BINANCE Pool has they dont have minimum payout and pay everyday the quantity you have mined. 👍

With that you can stake everyday too , the 1.5% flexible and put on automatic so it adds every day the sum you mine and the sum you % in Stake.

ASIC for home use its not very good.

Build systems for probably 10 ASICS at a time.........and let's say the most you can accommodate is 20 miners; by the time you get to 14 you'd need to start planning to change out older ones for more efficient ones.

Stunning-Ask5916,"That's a good idea. The challenge is getting the heat from the miner to the residents.

You want to create a loop.  Cool air gets to the miner, warm air gets to the people.  It should be enough to semi enclose the system and force air on one of the legs.

Does your house have a laundry chute?  (A laundry chute is a small rectangular metal channel that allows people to drop dirty clothes from upper floors to the basement.). If so, you can semi enclose the landing area in the basement and force air from there into the miner.  Warm air will naturally work it's way upstairs.

You will want to be able to redirect warm air outside during the summer.  You will actually want input and exhaust paths; if you have exhaust only, you will create a vacuum inside, which will pull in outside air, working your AC harder.",ix54kww,yzwp63,/r/BitcoinMining/comments/yzwp63/will_an_s19_placed_in_the_basement_heat_up_a/ix54kww/,1,BitcoinMining,2022-11-20 20:43:36

IgnitionMining,"First question you have to answer is: what is your electricity cost in kWh. 

This is determine the profitability of your mining operation. Newer (more expensive) miner will have higher efficiency (more production per power). 

At this BTC price point, you will need a electricity cost of $0.07/kWh or lower to make a profit, with the S19jPro or equivalent, like the Whatsminer M30S++ or Avalon 1246.

Classic_Ad3154,"OK, others already mentioned energy cost as it relates to TH and to being profitable. So I'm dealing with the actual miners below. 
As someone who started with Canaan Avalon A1246 85THs, then went to MicroBT Whatsminer M30S 90TH and now Antminers T19 88Ts;
I'd personally go with the Antminer T19 88TH or S19 90TH miners which would currently cost you between $1,200 and $1,500. They are more reliable, parts and service knowledge in general are way more available than any of the others and they have a better and more detailed URL machine readout page.

The Avalons have some PSU issues. It seems to have been corrected on the newer models....but you never know if you'd be getting new old stock when buying. Their warranty service is downright horrible and you have to ship the miner back to China for warranty repairs that you are capable of doing in a couple hours if they just send you the parts. I've had to design my own upgrades to install on my brand new miners before I put them into use in order to prevent electrical dead shorts in the PSUs. Also, when you get an Antminer that's rated at 88TH it does 88 or better every single day....while my Avalons rated at 85 does more like 78TH most days to 82TH on a good day.

The Whatsminers work pretty well but unless you're in an industrial type location I'd keep away from them in any setting for home use or use anywhere that neighbours of any type may be affected. These machines only have 2 slightly larger fans compared to the others miners mentioned which has 4 slightly smaller fans.......so once they are close to other machines or are faced with some heat; the fans run full-time at 100% (somewhere around 7,000 RPM) and they are !LOUD! Way louder than four fans running at about 65 to 85% to manage the same amount of heat. These miners are also way more heat sensitive the the others and throws up codes and trip for overheating in environments where the others are still working in the green of their indicator's range.

So far the Antminers (which I could not afford at the beginning of my journey as they were way more expensive than Avalons at the time) are working out better for me and I intend/hope to get more T19 88THs and S19 90TH.

Don't buy used miners at this time; with the current prices being so low the price difference between new and used is insignificant......save yourself the unnecessary troubles.

Best wishes. 
As I tell everyone on here; these miners are a lot louder than you imagine.",ixeynrq,z19r2p,/r/BitcoinMining/comments/z19r2p/new_to_mining/ixeynrq/,1,BitcoinMining,2022-11-22 22:51:29

Classic_Ad3154,"After buying from numerous buyers in China, dealing with language barriers and having to keep my fingers crossed hoping that I'd actually get my miners; I finally got a supplier that was not only totally above board but also gave me better technical support than the manufacturer along with opening a door for me to communicate with a school and professors that teach miner repair and was always willing to walk me through troubleshooting problems until I got good enough to now do most any troubleshooting on my miners on my own. I'm now good enough to find the problem and change out the faulty component......that way I keep all my miners in service......please note; I do not repair circuit boards.....I change out components and that works out way better for me than having to ship a miner back to China for warranty repairs. I plan on shipping all faulty components to the school in a single box once a year or every other year (depending on how many issues I have) so they may repair all and ship back to me.

I can act as middle man and have miners shipped to you. Whereby you communicate in English with me. My supplier prices are a bit higher (about 10 to 15%) than some of the super low scammer prices you see on the Internet.....but is considerably cheaper (about 10%) than the so called ""Trusted Sellers"" you see online. 

I'm not sure where you are located; but if you are in the US your home probably has the Power requirements into your main box and to your dryer and stove/range.....so I would recommend that you get an electrician to tap out the power and breakers to your required location.

All payments can be via US$ stablecoin preferably (as the order gets out within 48 hours) or by wire transfer (which takes anywhere from 5 to 14 days).

sciencetaco,"A used S19 miner could work but there are a few considerations:

1) The power is free, but could you get paid to send it back to the grid? Factor that cost into your calculations 

2) an s19 miner uses about 3000W of power. You’re going to need appropriate electrical setup to power it. You can’t plug them into a standard power socket. 

3) 15kw of power is the max capacity of your system? It will only be generating that under peak conditions. Morning, late afternoon, and cloudy days might not be enough to run a 3000W miner plus whatever else your household is using. You’ll be drawing from the grid which is likely unprofitable. Only running the miner when there is enough Solar to power it means it could only be on ~30% of the time at best. That’s going to increase your payback time which is already going to be multiple years 

4) you need to deal with the noise and heat. These things are LOUD and need good ventilation

I run an old S9 miner at home from my excess solar (10kw system). But I don’t realistically expect to get a return in my investment. It’s a hobby.",ixxhtmq,z5diq0,/r/BitcoinMining/comments/z5diq0/new_mining/ixxhtmq/,1,BitcoinMining,2022-11-27 03:36:34

mark2685,"Not related to the Russia VIP bundle, but I purchased another bundle through compass in August/September of 2021. Shipping delays, facility issues, etc.., and never had more than 4 hashing at any point in time.

They had to move miners due to another facility issue in Ontario, and offered the option to have my miners shipped, or pay an increased hosting price. I opted to having them shipped to me. Never received any sort of information until after 3 support tickets, numerous queries, messaging VPs and director of mining on Twitter, and refusing to pay hosting costs, and then they finally opted to ship the miners to another facility I found. They’ve shipped 4 of my 7 miners so far, and all of been hashing consistently since their arrival. At compass, miners would go offline weekly, and it would take Compass up to a month to get them back online. Not a single hiccup so far with this facility.

I’m not sure what sorta crap Compass is dealing with, but moving my miners has been the best decision so far.

JedimEmO,"You can always use an excel spreadsheet, but sometimes that can be tiring. However, there are crypto tax software that already do everything for you and can save you a lot of time because you only need to sync your wallets, exchanges or blockchain addresses and they'll import all your transactions to work out the numbers for you. There are tons of software to choose from and not many will actually get the job done for you, but some of the decent ones include crypto tax calculator, zenledger and Koinly, which is the one I'm currently using. I was looking for accuracy, straightforward UX design (I was a newbie and found Koinly to be the most beginner friendly), safety at all times (data privacy is #1 for me and for them too apparently) and one that actually does what it says it does: automate your crypto taxes nightmare. So far, I've found all of it in Koinly and haven't had to struggle too much doing my taxes.

Mind you, I did try several software until I finally gave Koinly a shot and haven't looked back since. Now, my recommendation is: get one that protects your data at all costs and that is not in the eye of the hurricane for being hacked, sold or bankrupt.

Classic_Ad3154,"I've been buying miners constantly since last November. When I started my 85THs cost me $7,500. so did my second order, then the crash came but I saw it as an opportunity to build my total hashrate at a discount so I bought 85s, 88s and 90s on a regular basis over the year at $5,500, $3,800, $2,200 and the most recent ones at $1,450 and $1,300. 

I basically kind of saw it as Daily Cost Averaging into hashrate. To me; I ignored the income end and focused on achieving my initially planned hashrate at a discount as if it wasn't for the crash I'd have only 1/4 of the hashrate that I now have. The process has been pretty much a win/win event for me as each time the price goes up my income increases a bit but even so I worry about not having reached my target hashrate before miner prices skyrocket again and each time the price dips; I get a couple more miners at a better price. 

The hardest thing in the process was the constantly rising difficulty which meant that I had to keep increasing my targeted total hashrate to meet my goals. But thank GOD we got a drop this week and is expecting another. 

As I've mentioned in other post; BITCOIN mining is an ""ARMS RACE"" so if you don't keep building you are going to shrink away. 

I'm buying one or two machines this week even though the price is up about 15% over my last purchase about 8 weeks ago. I'm not looking for the bottom; I'm really focused on DCA-ing hashrate. Neither I'm I focused on immediate income; as I'm in to BTC for the long hall. 

I believe that everything is half chance; so if it falls to nothing; we'll I tried, but my investment is based on BITCOIN's recovery. Should BITCOIN return to what it was last November when I bought my first machines; I'll be making 5 to 6 times the income that I projected if it hadn't crashed as I wouldn't have been able to purchase the amount of miners at the then price.......even with the higher income back then.

If miner prices stays this low or gets any lower; I'd try to keep buying even if I get to the point that I don't have the available utilities to plug them in. They would either be a re-sellable investment on there own or I'd certainly figure out how or where to plug them in once BITCOIN mining gets back to last year's Highs.

hamandeggsmond,"For example if you mined with Bit 49 it’s an all in price of 7.25 Cents per kWh and around ~95% uptime. On-site repair center etc.

You’ll probably be making about $1 profit per day.

But in the run up to the halving when there’s normally a pump you could be making $5-$10 net profit per day.

The idea at this time in the cycle is to break even and survive and then you’ll have rack space for when bitcoin pumps. When bitcoin pumps they’ll be a scramble for rack space and the asic value will increase too.

So you can buy machines now when they're cheap, and wait until the market goes up, hopefully breaking even or only losing a small amount while waiting.  If you wait to buy when the market recovers, the price of the hardware goes back up too.

But, the kicker is that waiting means the difficulty also rises, so you earn less over time.  And by the time the market recovers, the hardware may no longer be profitable even at the higher prices.  

Hardware is priced based on it's current return.  Usually it's priced higher than the return, so you're left gambling on a profit.",j03zcbd,zktmou,/r/BitcoinMining/comments/zktmou/hosted_mining_always_unprofitable_am_i_missing/j03zcbd/,1,BitcoinMining,2022-12-13 22:18:33

When panels hit ~0.15/watt and battery prices drop by 60%, then solar will be more realistic.  These systems lose efficiency quickly and require maintenance.  Sine wave inverters and MPPT controllers aren’t cheap either.

A 3kw miner needs a 15kw solar pv system to be completely powered by solar.  


Battery bank size depends on what type of batteries you are using. Another rule of thumb is to not let lead acid batteries go below 50% charge. If you size you battery bank to run your miner for 24 hours without charging, you would need a 144kwhr lead acid battery system. Lithium batteries should never go below 20% charge so you would need a 90kwhr Lithium battery bank.

To expand on the S9 market pricing, you likely can get $80-$100 USD per unit with someone who’s selling in bulk. Shipping and a better quality/condition would warrant 100-200 depending on where it’s located, it’s condition and availability of other options where it’s located.

So I have a flat payment per month in fiat that covers all my household usage and I get some sats back per month more than the utility company offers to pay for the surplus

A deviation from this is what causes the difficulty to adjust.
